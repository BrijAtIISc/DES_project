        "text": "Iran is targeting the U.S. election with fake news sites and cyberattacks, Microsoft says\nAlleged Trump campaign hack seems to be Iranian \"replication of 2016 Russian playbook,\" says Krebs\n\nIran is accelerating online activity that appears intended to influence the U.S. election, in one case targeting a presidential campaign with an email phishing attack, Microsoft said Friday.\n\nIranian actors also have spent recent months creating fake news sites and impersonating activists, laying the groundwork to stoke division and potentially sway American voters this fall, especially in swing states, the technology giant found.\n\nThe findings in Microsoft's newest threat intelligence report show how Iran, which has been active in recent U.S. elections, is evolving its tactics for another election that's likely to have global implications. The report goes a step beyond anything U.S. intelligence officials have disclosed, giving specific examples of Iranian groups and the actions they have taken so far. Iran's United Nations mission denied it had plans to interfere or launch cyberattacks in the U.S. presidential election.\n\nThe report doesn't specify Iran's intentions besides sowing chaos in the United States, though U.S. officials have previously hinted that Iran particularly opposes former President Donald Trump. U.S. officials also have expressed alarm about Tehran's efforts to seek retaliation for a 2020 strike on an Iranian general that was ordered by Trump. This week, the Justice Department unsealed criminal charges against a Pakistani man with ties to Iran who's alleged to have hatched assassination plots targeting multiple officials, potentially including Trump.\n\nThe report also reveals how Russia and China are exploiting U.S. political polarization to advance their own divisive messaging in a consequential election year.\n\nMicrosoft's report identified four examples of recent Iranian activity that the company expects to increase as November's election draws closer.\n\nFirst, a group linked to Iran's Revolutionary Guard in June targeted a high-ranking U.S. presidential campaign official with a phishing email, a form of cyberattack often used to gather sensitive information, according to the report, which didn't identify which campaign was targeted. The group concealed the email's origins by sending it from the hacked email account of a former senior adviser, Microsoft said.\n\nDays later, the Iranian group tried to log into an account that belonged to a former presidential candidate, but wasn't successful, Microsoft's report said. The company notified those who were targeted.\n\nIn a separate example, an Iranian group has been creating websites that pose as U.S.-based news sites targeted to voters on opposite sides of the political spectrum, the report said.\n\nOne fake news site that lends itself to a left-leaning audience insults Trump by calling him \"raving mad\" and suggests he uses drugs, the report said. Another site meant to appeal to Republican readers centers on LGBTQ issues and gender-affirming surgery.\n\nA third example Microsoft cited found that Iranian groups are impersonating U.S. activists, potentially laying the groundwork for influence operations closer to the election.\n\nFinally, another Iranian group in May compromised an account owned by a government employee in a swing state, the report said. It was unclear whether that cyberattack was related to election interference efforts.\n\nIran's U.N. mission sent The Associated Press an emailed statement: \"Iran has been the victim of numerous offensive cyber operations targeting its infrastructure, public service centers, and industries. Iran's cyber capabilities are defensive and proportionate to the threats it faces. Iran has neither the intention nor plans to launch cyber attacks. The U.S. presidential election is an internal matter in which Iran does not interfere.\"\n\nThe Microsoft report said that as Iran escalates its cyber influence, Russia-linked actors also have pivoted their influence campaigns to focus on the U.S. election, while actors linked to the Chinese Communist Party have taken advantage of pro-Palestinian university protests and other current events in the U.S. to try to raise U.S. political tensions.\n\nMicrosoft said it has continued to monitor how foreign foes are using generative AI technology. The increasingly cheap and easy-to-access tools can generate lifelike fake images, photos and videos in seconds, prompting concern among some experts that they will be weaponized to mislead voters this election cycle.\n\nWhile many countries have experimented with AI in their influence operations, the company said, those efforts haven't had much impact so far. The report said as a result, some actors have \"pivoted back to techniques that have proven effective in the past - simple digital manipulations, mischaracterization of content, and use of trusted labels or logos atop false information.\"\n\nMicrosoft's report aligns with recent warnings from U.S. intelligence officials, who say America's adversaries appear determined to seed the internet with false and incendiary claims ahead of November's vote.\n\nTop intelligence officials said last month that Russia continues to pose the greatest threat when it comes to election disinformation, while there are indications that Iran is expanding its efforts and China is proceeding cautiously when it comes to 2024.\n\nIran's efforts seem aimed at undermining candidates seen as being more likely to increase tension with Tehran, the officials said. That's a description that fits Trump, whose administration ended a nuclear deal with Iran, reimposed sanctions and ordered the killing of the top Iranian general.\n\nAn update last month from officials with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), FBI and Department of Homeland Security concluded that Tehran's efforts appeared designed to undercut Trump.\n\n\"Since our last update, the [intelligence community] has observed Tehran working to influence the presidential election, probably because Iranian leaders want to avoid an outcome they perceive would increase tensions with the United States,\" a senior ODNI official said, adding, \"Iran's preference is essentially a reflection of its desire to not worsen tensions with the United States, and Iran is opposing the candidate that Iran's leaders perceive would increase those tensions.\"\n\nThe officials did not explicitly name the Trump campaign and referred instead to the key findings of the 2020 assessment. They also stressed that most of Iran's online activities, which they said rely on a \"vast web\" of internet personas, have been focused on stoking chaos and societal divisions.\n\nThe influence efforts also coincide with a time of high tensions between Iran and Israel, whose military the U.S. strongly supports.\n\nDirector of National Intelligence Avril Haines said last month that the Iranian government has covertly supported American protests over Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza. In the statement, issued on July 9, Haines said the intelligence community had \"observed actors tied to Iran's government posing as activists online seeking to encourage protests and even providing financial support to protesters.\"\n\nAmerica's foes, Iran among them, have a long history of seeking to influence U.S. elections. In 2020, groups linked to Iran sent emails to Democratic voters in an apparent effort to intimidate them into voting for Trump, intelligence officials said.",

So where do things stand?\n\nFive things are worth noting.\n\n1. The race remains tight. The RealClear average of national polls has Kamala Harris up by half a percentage point over Donald Trump. That\u2019s better than where Democrats were three weeks ago, when Trump led by slightly more than three points. However, it is well below where Democrats were four years ago, when Joe Biden led Trump by nearly seven points at this stage in the race. The fact that Harris lags Biden\u2019s 2020 standing suggests that she still needs to make up ground. The Electoral College favors Republican candidates because rural red-leaning states have a disproportionate share of votes. A Democratic presidential candidate likely needs to build a three-percentage point lead in the national polls before their chance of winning the Electoral College tops 50 percent.\n\nThe Water's Edge James M.

Bush famously called it the \u201cBig Mo\u201d\u2014big momentum. Right now, Democrats look to have it. Harris\u2019s slight lead over Trump in the average of national polls may understate things; polls are lagging indicators because it takes time to conduct them and prepare the results. Moreover, Harris is doing well in the battleground states that will decide the election. She is also seeing contributions flood into her campaign coffers and supporters lining up to attend her campaign events. Harris\u2019s momentum could even increase. The Democratic National Convention opens in ten days. She should have an unparalleled opportunity to make the case for her candidacy to the nation. The problem with momentum, however, is that it can be fickle. Just ask Republicans. They left their national convention three weeks ago talking about running away with the presidential election. That talk has stopped.\n\n3. Personalities, not policies, continue to dominate the campaign. Some presidential campaigns have defining issues. It might be Social Security. Or the national debt. Or tax rates. Or war. Election 2024 has yet to produce a defining issue, though abortion, immigration, and jobs are contenders. The Republican Party platform is long on slogans and short on specific policy prescriptions. Trump has disavowed Project 2025, which purported to lay out the agenda for a Trump presidency. Given its late start, the Harris-Walz campaign has stressed big themes like \u201cfreedom\u201d and \u201cfighting\u201d for the American people, not specific governing priorities and choices. That could change in the coming weeks. But talk about which candidate is \u201cdumb\u201d or \u201cweird\u201d looks likely to dominate the political conversation.\n\n4. Foreign policy remains an afterthought. The United States faces a slew of challenges overseas. China, the war in Ukraine, and a possible regional war in the Middle East lead the list. Each of these issues and others are top priorities for some groups of voters. But neither Harris nor Trump is saying much beyond generalities about the U.S. role in the world. That doesn\u2019t mean that the outcome of the U.S. election won\u2019t have a major impact on U.S. foreign policy. To the contrary, Harris and Trump would likely approach the world very differently.\n\n5. Wildcards abound. July showed us how unpredictable the future can be. A lone gunman shot Trump. Biden quit the race. The stock market peaked and talk of recession revived. A misguided software update upended global travel. So events over the next ninety days could change the course of the electoral conversation. But the wildcards don\u2019t end there. We don\u2019t know how accurate the polls are. Or whether third-party candidates will continue to fade as factors in the race. Or who will turn out to vote. Or how the efforts in red states to make voting more secure (in the eyes of supporters)\u2014or to suppress the Democratic vote (in the eyes of opponents)\u2014will play out. Or whether America\u2019s election infrastructure will stand up to what could potentially be another record turnout coupled with possible renewed efforts to intimidate the vote counters.\n\nSo buckle up. It could be a turbulent next three months.\n\nCampaign Update\n\nHarris is now the official Democratic presidential nominee and not just the presumptive nominee. The Democratic Party wrapped up five days of online voting on Monday. Harris picked up 99 percent of the delegates\u2019 votes. The vote ensures that Harris will meet the qualifying requirements in all fifty states for appearing on the ballot. As a result of the virtual vote, the roll-call vote at the Democratic National Convention in thirteen days will be symbolic rather than substantive.\n\nWill we see a Harris-Trump debate? The answer seems to be yes, but some details remain to be worked out. At a press conference at Mar-a-Lago yesterday, Trump said there would be three presidential debates\u2014one on Fox on September 4, one on ABC on September 10, and one on NBC on September 25. (Trump confused when ABC and NBC might host debates, which his campaign subsequently corrected.) Harris has said she is willing to debate Trump on September 10, as Biden had agreed to do. So far, however, she has only said that she is \u201chappy to have that conversation\u201d about possible additional debates. Beyond that, the rules for the potential Fox and NBC debates have yet to be set.\n\nWhat the Candidates Are Saying\n\nTrump\u2019s impromptu press conference at Mar-a-Lago yesterday covered a lot of ground. As is often the case with Trump, much of what he said wasn\u2019t true. Harris\u2019s ascension to the Democratic nomination is not \u201cunconstitutional\u201d as Trump himself later seemed to acknowledge. The \u201cvast majority of the country\u201d does not in fact \u201csupport\u201d him. It is not the case that \u201cnot one American soldier was shot at or killed\u201d in Afghanistan in 2020 as he negotiated with the Taliban. The rally he held on January 6, 2021 did not draw larger crowds than Martin Luther King\u2019s famous 1963 \u201cI-Have-A-Dream\u201d speech. Trump did not fly on a helicopter with California powerbroker Willie Brown that nearly crashed.\n\nAlthough Trump largely ignored substantive policy issues, he did make news on one issue. He argued that \u201cthe president should have at least a say\u201d on setting interest rates because he personally would \u201chave a better instinct than, in many cases, people that would be on the Federal Reserve\u2014or the chairman.\u201d Placing decisions about interest-rate policy in the hands of the president probably belongs in the Hall of Fame of bad public-policy pronouncements. The Fed is independent for a reason. All presidents would have an incentive to use interest-rate policy to advance their political interests rather than the national interest.\n\nPro-Palestinian protesters tried to interrupt Harris as she spoke at a campaign rally in Detroit on Wednesday. She countered by saying: \u201cIf you want Trump to win, then say that.\u201d That remark brought the crowd to its feet.\n\nEarlier in the day, Harris met with a group of activists that included leaders of the effort to press the Biden administration to change its policy toward the war in Gaza. The Harris campaign subsequently released a statement that \u201cin this brief engagement,\u201d the vice president \u201creaffirmed that her campaign will continue to engage with those communities.\u201d One of the steps that the pro-Palestinian activists urged Harris to take is to embargo arms destined for Israel. Yesterday, Harris\u2019s national security advisor, Phil Gordon, tweeted that Harris \u201cwill always ensure Israel is able to defend itself against Iran and Iran-backed terrorist groups. She does not support an arms embargo on Israel. She will continue to work to protect civilians in Gaza and to uphold international humanitarian law.\u201d\n\nJD Vance accused Tim Walz of dodging a deployment with the Minnesota National Guard to Iraq and embellishing his military service, calling it \u201cstolen valor garbage.\u201d The first charge is dubious, the second makes a mountain out of a molehill. Walz retired from the Minnesota National Guard in May 2005 after twenty-four years of service, and months before his unit received official deployment orders for Iraq. (It\u2019s not clear when Walz submitted his papers requesting retirement.) Walz has said he decided to retire to focus on running for Congress. He filed his papers to do so in February 2005. The following month, the Pentagon indicated that the Minnesota National Guard would likely deploy to Iraq sometime in the next two years.\n\nThe embellishment charge turns on the proper way to refer to Walz\u2019s military rank and whether he encouraged voters to believe he served in combat. Walz reached the rank of command sergeant major, but he officially retired with the lower rank of master sergeant because he didn\u2019t complete the paperwork necessary to hold the rank in retirement. So, while it is correct to say that Walz reached the rank of command master sergeant or was a command master sergeant, it is incorrect to say he is a retired command sergeant major. The Harris campaign initially described Walz that way, which it has since changed in his online biography.\n\nAside from that controversy, Republicans have noted that Walz said at a gubernatorial campaign event in 2018 that \u201cwe can make sure those weapons of war that I carried in war\u201d are not flooding America\u2019s cities. Walz never served in combat. However, he did deploy to Italy in 2003 in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, the U.S. invasion of Iraq. More generally, Walz has downplayedhis National Guard service, saying: \u201cThere are certainly folks that did far more than I did. I know that.\u201d And while Walz never saw combat during his time in the Minnesota National Guard, Democrats (and journalists) have pointed out that neither did Vance in his time in the Marine Corps. While the Republican vice-presidential nominee did deploy to Iraq for six months, he did so as a reporter in a public affairs unit and not as a frontline fighter. In all, the military-service flap appears to be what the Wall Street Journal editorial page today called \u201cthin gruel.\u201d Both Walz and Vance served their country honorably.\n\nWhat the Pundits Are Saying\n\nMark Hannah and Rachel Rizzo wrote in Foreign Policy that a Harris-Walz administration has the opportunity to make U.S. foreign policy less militaristic. Hannah and Rizzo contend that \u201cWalz may help Harris reinvest in diplomacy and abandon America\u2019s reflex for world-saving military interventionism. He ran for Congress in 2006 on opposition to the Iraq War, later led a group of Democrats urging then-President Barack Obama to abstain from war with Syria, and was an early co-sponsor of a war powers resolution that tried to end U.S. troop involvement in Saudi Arabia\u2019s war in Yemen. He was also a vocal supporter of the Iran deal and saw the mutual benefits of opening up trade between Cuba and the United States.\u201d\n\nWashington Post reporters gained access to texts between JD Vance and a far-right conspiracy figure named Charles Johnson. According to the report, \u201ctheir correspondence over\u202620 months\u2014extending into the weeks before former president Donald Trump picked Vance as his running mate\u2014a glimpse of the Republican vice-presidential nominee\u2019s off-the-cuff musings, often matching his public expressions but voiced with much less polish and more profanity. Vance was just as casual in discussing America\u2019s foreign alliances as he was in evaluating his own private alliances with the GOP\u2019s moneyed class. With Johnson, he pondered responsibility for the sabotage of the Nord Stream gas pipelines and crudely described his aversion to the Ukrainian government and refusal to consider its pleas for U.S. assistance.\u201d\n\nForeign Policy\u2019s Amy Mackinnon explored what Harris learned investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election as a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. Mackinnon reports that the investigation was \u201ca highly formative experience that left her [Harris] with few illusions about Moscow\u2019s intentions.\u201d\n\nWhat the Polls Show\n\nThe Pew Research Center released a report showing that how Americans view the U.S. role in the world varies substantially by age and less so by party identification. Older Americans are far more likely than younger Americans to say they want the United States to play an active role in world affairs. For instance, three-in-four Americans over the age of sixty-five favor an active U.S. role in the world; just one-in-three Americans between the ages of eighteen and thirty-four do. In contrast, 60 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents and 51 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents favor an active U.S. role in the world. Where Democrats and Republicans diverge is on the question of allies: 76 percent of Democrats believe the United States should consider allies\u2019 interests when making foreign-policy decisions while only 43 percent of Republicans do.\n\nThe Campaign Schedule\n\nThe Democratic National Convention opens in Chicago in ten days (August 19, 2024).\n\nThe second presidential debate is in thirty-two days (September 10, 2024)\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s sentencing hearing on his New York felony convictions is in forty days (September 18, 2024).\n\nThe first in-person absentee voting in the nation begins in Minnesota and South Dakota in forty-two days (September 20, 2024).\n\nElection Day is eighty-eight days away.\n\nInauguration Day is 164 days away.\n\nShelby Sires assisted in the preparation of this post.",

        "text": "ABC News: Trump-Harris agree to presidential debate\nShowdown is set: Trump and Harris plan to debate in September\n\nMs Harris confirmed that she will attend the ABC debate while at an event in Michigan on Thursday, and said later that she would be open to additional debates.\n\n\u201cWe think we should do three debates,\u201d Trump said, suggesting two additional debates that he said would be hosted by Fox News and NBC, respectively.\n\nThe network confirmed the showdown in a post on X, formerly Twitter, after Trump said on Thursday that he would be open to debating his Democratic rival multiple times before the November election.\n\nABC News has said it will host the first debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris on 10 September.\n\nThe network said the debate will be moderated by World News Tonight anchor and managing editor David Muir and ABC News Live Prime anchor Linsey Davis.\n\n\u201cI am looking forward to debating Donald Trump and we have a date of September 10. I hear he\u2019s finally committed to it and I\u2019m looking forward to it,\" Ms Harris said at the event in Detroit.\n\nMr Trump, the Republican candidate, debated President Joe Biden once in June.\n\nThe two were slated to do so again on 10 September but Mr Biden withdrew from the presidential race after a disastrous performance against Trump in the televised matchup. That paved the way for Ms Harris to become the Democratic nominee.\n\nThe confirmation of the debate on ABC marks an end to a back-and-forth that followed Mr Biden's decision to leave the race between the Trump and Harris campaigns over that planned showdown.\n\nTrump had previously said that he wanted a debate hosted by the conservative network Fox News, saying it would take place in Pennsylvania, \"at a site in an area to be determined\".\n\nThe Harris campaign had maintained they would still like to debate Trump on 10 September.\n\nAt a news conference on Thursday at his Mar-a-Lago resort, Trump also said he would like to debate Ms Harris two additional times - on 4 September on Fox News and on 25 September on NBC.\n\nTrump said that CBS will host a debate between the two vice-presidential nominees, Republican JD Vance and Democratic Tim Walz.\n\nNBC News is reportedly in discussions with both campaigns about a potential debate this autumn, the New York Times reported.\n\nFox News said it sent formal letters to both campaigns last month proposing a September debate in Pennsylvania, though the Harris campaign said on Thursday that \"Trump has to show up\" to the ABC debate before they confirm any further showdowns.\n\nTrump also criticised Ms Harris for not taking reporter questions or doing an interview since she became the likely Democratic nominee just over two weeks ago.\n\nHe called her \u201cbarely competent\u201d and criticised her intelligence.\n\nLater on Thursday, Ms Harris told reporters that she has asked her team to \"get an interview scheduled\" before the end of the month.\n\nTrump's hour-long event was held amid reports that his campaign is feeling the pressure from Democrats, who have new enthusiasm under Ms Harris and have been dominating headlines.\n\nNational and battleground state polls suggest her campaign has gained ground in recent days, though the race for the White House remains a close contest.\n\nThe former president denied he had \"recalibrated\" his campaign to challenge Ms Harris instead of Mr Biden, and he appeared to prickle when asked about the audience Ms Harris draws at rallies.\n\n\"Oh, give me a break,\" he said, arguing that crowds at his rallies were larger than at hers.\n\nHis Thursday news conference is the first he has held in several months, as his campaign has previously focused on holding rallies across the country.\n\nTrump also praised his running mate Mr Vance, who was recently under fire for comments he made in 2021 when he said those without children shouldn't be leading the country and that women who don't have children are \"miserable\" and \"childless cat ladies\".\n\n\u201cI have to tell you, JD Vance has really stepped up,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe's doing a fantastic job.\u201d\n\nHe took aim at Ms Harris' track record on immigration and the economy.\n\nHe said that 20 million people had come over the US's southern border with Mexico, possibly many more, during the Biden-Harris administration.\n\nSince Mr Biden took office, the US Customs and Border Protection agency says almost 10.1 million crossings have been recorded.\n\nWhile this is a significant increase on Mr Trump's time in power and the highest figure recorded under any US administration, the 20 million figure does not seem probable.\n\nThe former president also said his tax cuts were \"the biggest in history\".\n\nBut according to analysis by the independent Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, they were the eighth-largest since 1918 measured as a percentage of the size of the economy (GDP), and the fourth-largest in dollar terms since 1940 adjusted for inflation.\n\nAlthough Trump didn't introduce the largest tax cut overall, he did pass the largest corporate tax cut in US history.\n\nHe repeated his belief that US presidents should have a say over interest rates and monetary policy - a departure from the longstanding practice of having the US Federal Reserve, an independent body, oversee these matters.\n\nHe emphasised his priorities of lowering inflation, lowering crime rates and strengthening the military.\n\nAnd he criticised the administration's transport policy, saying people would be \"forced\" to buy electric cars.\n\nHowever, the Biden administration has made it clear there are no plans for a ban on the sale of petrol vehicles.\n\nMs Harris on Thursday addressed United Auto Workers in Detroit, and thanked the union for endorsing her.\n\nShe said there are \"89 days to get this done\" ahead of the election.\n\nAdditional reporting by BBC Verify",

This action targets persons involved in supporting Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine through military resource production and transshipment of goods to Russia, sanctions evasion on behalf of Belarusian defense entities, and revenue generation for Belarusian oligarchs in Alyaksandr Lukashenka\u2019s inner circle. OFAC is concurrently designating five of these targets\u2014three individuals and two entities\u2014pursuant to Russia-related E.O. 14024.\u00a0Lukashenka\u2019s support for Russia\u2019s indefensible war against Ukraine comes at a high cost for Belarus. Lukashenka has traded his country\u2019s autonomy and standing in the international community for his and his cronies\u2019 own financial and political benefits. Today\u2019s action reinforces the United States\u2019 commitment to holding the Lukashenka regime accountable for its attacks on the Belarusian democratic movement and its flagrant exploitation of the Belarusian people.\u00a0\u201cAs Belarus marks another year under Lukashenka\u2019s rule, the regime\u2019s blatantly corrupt, destabilizing, and anti-democratic acts\u2014along with its continued support for Russia\u2019s illegal invasion of Ukraine\u2014have only further ostracized Belarus from the global community,\u201d said Acting Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Bradley T. Smith. \u201cThe United States, in coordination with our allies and partners, remains committed to holding the regime and its key facilitators accountable.\u201dIn the wake of the fraudulent August 2020 Belarusian Presidential election, Lukashenka resorted to brutal crackdowns on peaceful protesters, democratic organizations, and journalists in order to illegitimately retain power. Since then, Lukashenka\u2019s actions have eroded Belarusian civil society and enabled Lukashenka, his family, and his inner circle to enrich themselves at the expense of Belarus\u2019s citizens and sovereignty. The Lukashenka regime continues to support Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine by hosting Russian military bases and allowing Russian forces to use Belarus as a staging point for military operations. \u00a0Today\u2019s designations are amplified by actions undertaken by the United States\u2019 partners in the European Union (EU)\u2014who targeted Belarusian authorities involved in human rights abuses earlier this week\u2014and Canada and the United Kingdom, who today also announced additional sanctions on the Lukashenka regime. Together, these actions signal the international community\u2019s continuing solidarity with the Belarusian people in their struggle for a free, democratic, and sovereign Belarus.\u00a0The Department of State also took steps to impose visa restrictions on 19 regime officials and their affiliates for their involvement in undermining democracy in Belarus, pursuant to Presidential Proclamation 8015.PELENG SANCTIONS EVASION NETWORKAs part of the strong ties between Russia and Belarus with respect to their technology and defense-industrial industries, Belarus provides Russia with components for satellite communication systems and optical equipment. U.S.-designated Peleng JSC (Peleng) is the leading design enterprise in Belarus\u2019s optoelectronic industry, producing components for spacecraft, satellites, and sights with thermal imagers for military vehicles. Peleng is one of Russia\u2019s most important industrial partners in Belarus and has partnered with Russia on ventures ranging from artillery unit complex development to airfield automated meteorological systems supply. OFAC designated Peleng on\u00a0December 2, 2021\u00a0pursuant to E.O. 14038 for\u00a0operating or having operated in the defense and related materiel sector of the economy of Belarus and for operating or having operated in the security sector of the economy of Belarus.\u00a0LLC Laboratory of Additive Technologies (LAT), also recently known as LLC Laser Devices and Technologies, is identified as a Belarus-based entity focused on research and development in the natural sciences; however, LAT generates its revenue by supplying components to companies, including Peleng, that produce weapons for the Russian Federation and are under U.S. and EU sanctions. For example, LAT has procured encoder disks\u2014a component for sensors that detect motion and are used in panoramic sights for T-72s or other tanks\u2014from a Taiwanese precision instrument maker and bypassed sanctions to move the encoder disks and payment through a third-country intermediary. Yuri Aleksandrovich Chivel (Chivel), a Belarusian national, is LAT's Director and has signed contracts certifying that LAT intends to and has supplied components to Peleng. \u00a0OFAC is designating LAT pursuant to E.O. 14038 for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of Peleng, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14038.

Ruchservomotor also produces components for panoramic commander\u2019s sights for T-72 and T-90 Russian tanks, for which Peleng is the end user. By using LAT as an intermediary to ship Russian military equipment components, Ruchservomotor has attempted to obfuscate its direct sales and connection to the Russian military.\u00a0OFAC is designating Ruchservomotor pursuant to E.O. 14038 for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of LAT, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14038. OFAC is designating Zharski and Sidaruk pursuant to E.O. 14038 for having been leaders, officials, senior executive officers, or members of the board of directors of Ruchservomotor, an entity whose property and interests are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14038. \u00a0Belarusian manufacturers LLC AlYurTekh (AlYurTekh) and its Deputy Director, Aleksey Nikolaevich Yavorski (Yavorski), a Belarusian national; ALC Diskoms (Diskoms) and its Deputy Director, Arkady Samuilovich Dimenshtein\u00a0(Dimenshtein), a Belarusian national; LLC MOT (MOT) and its Commercial Director, Viktoriya Orestovna Savruk (Savruk), a Ukrainian national; LLC Grosver Grup (Grosver Grup) and its representative, Siarhei Uladzimiravich Kastsianok (Kastsianok), a Belarusian national; and Limited Liability Company Tochnaya Mekhanika\u00a0(Tochnaya Mekhanika) and its Director, Aleksandr Mikolaevich Leschanka\u00a0(Leschanka), a Belarusian national, have all signed contracts committing the respective companies to supply Peleng with goods or services.\u00a0OFAC is designating AlYurTekh, Diskoms, MOT, Grosver Grup, and Tochnaya Mekhanika pursuant to E.O. 14038 for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of Peleng, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14038.OFAC is designating Yavorski pursuant to E.O. 14038 for having been a leader, official, senior executive officer, or member of the board of directors of AlYurTekh, an entity whose property and interests are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14038. OFAC is designating Dimenshtein pursuant to E.O. 14038 for having been a leader, official, senior executive officer, or member of the board of directors of Diskoms, an entity whose property and interests are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14038. OFAC is designating Savruk pursuant to E.O. 14038 for having been a leader, official, senior executive officer, or member of the board of directors of MOT, an entity whose property and interests are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14038.

More specifically, Rada provided support to internationally designated Russian Private Military Company Wagner (Wagner Group) (designated on\u00a0June 20, 2017, November 15, 2022, and\u00a0January 26, 2023) by moving Wagner Group personnel and supplies to and from Africa. Additionally, on multiple occasions in 2024, RubiStar provided mission support to Russia by transporting Russian military personnel to Africa; and relatedly, at the request of a Russian company, RubiStar conducted the shipment of military helicopters to Africa. Finally, Rada has also participated in the trafficking of exotic animals between Mexico and Venezuela.Rada is led by its Commercial Director Dmitry Olegovich Ishchenko\u00a0(Ishchenko), a Russian national, and its Belarusian Director Ivan Nikolaevich Nareiko, while RubiStar is represented by its Belarusian Director, Evgeniy Ivanovich Mikholap\u00a0(Mikholap).OFAC is designating Rada, RubiStar, Ishchenko, Nareiko, and Mikholap pursuant to E.O. 14038 for operating or having operated in the transportation sector of the Belarus economy.OFAC is also designating Rada, RubiStar, Ishchenko, Nareiko, and Mikholap pursuant to E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the defense and related materiel sector of the Russian Federation economy. On June 12, 2024, Treasury broadened the definition of Russia\u2019s military-industrial base to include all persons blocked pursuant to E.O. 14024. This means that foreign financial institutions risk being sanctioned for conducting or facilitating significant transactions, or providing any service, involving any person blocked pursuant to E.O. 14024. Foreign financial institutions face sanctions risk for continuing to facilitate transactions involving Russia\u2019s military-industrial base. Financial institutions should review\u00a0OFAC\u2019s updated sanctions advisory\u00a0for practical guidance on how to identify sanctions risks and implement corresponding controls.Aviakompaniya Belkanto LLC\u00a0(Belkanto) is another Belarus-based private cargo airline company that was formed on paper in 2020, but began operating in 2022 under the leadership of former executives of Belarusian state-owned cargo airline company Transaviaexport. On\u00a0December 2, 2021, OFAC designated Transaviaexport for operating or having operated in the transportation sector of the economy of Belarus and for being owned or controlled by, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, the Government of Belarus (GoB). Following Transaviaexport\u2019s designation, Belkanto took ownership of one of Transaviaexport\u2019s planes and began leasing other aircraft from the company. Belkanto\u2019s business is focused on many of the same areas of operation as Transaviaexport, including the transshipment of goods to Russia.OFAC is designating Belkanto pursuant to E.O. 14038 for operating or having operated in the transportation sector of the Belarus economy.LOGISTICS COMPANIES GENERATING REVENUE FOR LUKASHENKA \u2018WALLETS\u2019 AND RE-EXPORTING GOODS TO RUSSIARuzekspeditsiya LLC\u00a0(Ruzekspeditsiya) and VLATE Logistic LLC (VLATE) are two Belarus-based logistics entities involved in the management of border crossing logistics and transportation services through Belarus to Russia, including the re-export of machinery, hydrocarbons, and Western European goods to Russia. These companies form the core of a logistics network controlled by U.S.-designated Lukashenka \u2018wallets\u2019\u00a0\u2014 Belarusian oligarchs who receive preferential treatment from the GoB in exchange for providing funds to Lukashenka and other members of his inner circle; financing Lukashenka\u2019s personal projects; and publicly supporting the regime \u2014\u00a0Aliaksandr Zaitsau\u00a0(February 24, 2022), Mikalai Varabei, and\u00a0Aliaksey Aleksin\u00a0(both on August 9, 2021). Since the\u00a0August 9, 2021 U.S. designation of these oligarchs\u2019 logistics company,\u00a0Bremino Group, Ruzekspeditsiya and VLATE have taken over many of Bremino Group\u2019s former operations, increasing these two companies\u2019 revenue exponentially. As a result of Ruzekspeditsiya and VLATE\u2019s connections to Zaitsau, Varabei, and Aleksin, both companies receive privileged tax status and limited customs fees from Lukashenka.Ruzekspeditsiya and VLATE are owned and directed by six individuals\u2014Belarusian businessmen Oleg Romualdovich Gerasim\u00a0(Gerasim), Oleg Fedorovich Barabanov\u00a0(Barabanov), Dmitry Mikhailovich Zamulevich\u00a0(Zamulevich), and Evgeniy Yurievich Krokhotin\u00a0(Krokhotin), and Russian businessmen Vladimir Mikhailovich Arkadiev (Arkadiev) and Oleg Vladimirovich Petrov\u00a0(Petrov)\u2014who are all personally connected to Zaitsau, Varabei, and Aleksin, and represent these oligarchs\u2019 interest in the companies.OFAC is designating Ruzekspeditsiya, VLATE, Gerasim, Petrov, Barabanov, Zamulevich, Arkadiev, and Krokhotin pursuant to E.O. 14038 for operating or having operated in the transportation sector of the Belarus economy.DEFENSE SECTOR ENTITIES SUPPORTING RUSSIAN WAR EFFORTJoint Stock Company Plant Legmash\u00a0(Legmash) is a Belarus-based manufacturing plant that has shifted its operations to produce artillery ammunition to supply the Belarusian and Russian armed forces. In May 2024, Lukashenka visited Legmash and alongside Legmash\u2019s Belarusian Director, Vladislav Nikolaevich Pavlenko\u00a0(Pavlenko), inspected Legmash\u2019s new defense sector operations and commented on Legmash\u2019s importance to the Belarusian defense-industrial sector.OFAC is designating Legmash and Pavlenko pursuant to E.O. 14038 for operating or having operated in the defense and related materiel sector of the Belarus economy.KB Unmanned Helicopters\u00a0(UAVHeli) is a Belarusian unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) developer and manufacturer that specializes in the production of drones for use in the security and defense sectors. Since its inception, UAVHeli has been led by Belarusian businessman Vladimir Vladimirovich Chudakov (Chudakov), who has sold UAVHeli\u2019s products to the Belarusian and Russian defense sectors.OFAC is designating UAVHeli and Chudakov pursuant to E.O. 14038 for operating or having operated in the defense and related materiel sector of the Belarus economy.LUKASHENKA\u2019S LUXURY AIRLINERLukashenka maintains a fleet of Government of Belarus-owned planes that he uses professionally and for his personal leisure. EW-001PB is a Boeing 767-32K(ER) owned by the Government of Belarus and used as part of the fleet of presidential aircraft.

In addition, any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, individually or in the aggregate, 50 percent or more by one or more blocked persons are also blocked. Unless authorized by a general or specific license issued by OFAC, or exempt, OFAC\u2019s regulations generally prohibit all transactions by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in property of designated or otherwise blocked persons.\u00a0In addition, financial institutions and other persons that engage in certain transactions or activities with the sanctioned entities and individuals may expose themselves to sanctions or be subject to an enforcement action. The prohibitions include the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any designated person, or the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.\u00a0The power and integrity of OFAC sanctions derive not only from OFAC\u2019s ability to designate and add persons to the SDN List, but also from its willingness to remove persons from the SDN List consistent with the law. The ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish, but to bring about a positive change in behavior. For information concerning the process for seeking removal from an OFAC list, including the SDN List, please refer to OFAC\u2019s Frequently Asked Question 897 here.\u00a0For detailed information on the process to submit a request for removal from an OFAC sanctions list, please click here.Click here for more information on the individuals and entities sanctioned today.###",

Foreign financial institutions face sanctions risk for continuing to facilitate transactions involving Russia\u2019s military-industrial base. Financial institutions should review OFAC\u2019s updated sanctions advisory for practical guidance on how to identify sanctions risks and implement corresponding controls.\n\nAviakompaniya Belkanto LLC (Belkanto) is another Belarus-based private cargo airline company that was formed on paper in 2020, but began operating in 2022 under the leadership of former executives of Belarusian state-owned cargo airline company Transaviaexport. On December 2, 2021, OFAC designated Transaviaexport for operating or having operated in the transportation sector of the economy of Belarus and for being owned or controlled by, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, the Government of Belarus (GoB). Following Transaviaexport\u2019s designation, Belkanto took ownership of one of Transaviaexport\u2019s planes and began leasing other aircraft from the company. Belkanto\u2019s business is focused on many of the same areas of operation as Transaviaexport, including the transshipment of goods to Russia.\n\nOFAC is designating Belkanto pursuant to E.O. 14038 for operating or having operated in the transportation sector of the Belarus economy.\n\nLOGISTICS COMPANIES GENERATING REVENUE FOR LUKASHENKA \u2018WALLETS\u2019 AND RE-EXPORTING GOODS TO RUSSIA\n\nRuzekspeditsiya LLC (Ruzekspeditsiya) and VLATE Logistic LLC (VLATE) are two Belarus-based logistics entities involved in the management of border crossing logistics and transportation services through Belarus to Russia, including the re-export of machinery, hydrocarbons, and Western European goods to Russia. These companies form the core of a logistics network controlled by U.S.-designated Lukashenka \u2018wallets\u2019 \u2014 Belarusian oligarchs who receive preferential treatment from the GoB in exchange for providing funds to Lukashenka and other members of his inner circle; financing Lukashenka\u2019s personal projects; and publicly supporting the regime \u2014 Aliaksandr Zaitsau (February 24, 2022), Mikalai Varabei, and Aliaksey Aleksin (both on August 9, 2021). Since the August 9, 2021 U.S. designation of these oligarchs\u2019 logistics company, Bremino Group, Ruzekspeditsiya and VLATE have taken over many of Bremino Group\u2019s former operations, increasing these two companies\u2019 revenue exponentially. As a result of Ruzekspeditsiya and VLATE\u2019s connections to Zaitsau, Varabei, and Aleksin, both companies receive privileged tax status and limited customs fees from Lukashenka.\n\nRuzekspeditsiya and VLATE are owned and directed by six individuals\u2014Belarusian businessmen Oleg Romualdovich Gerasim (Gerasim), Oleg Fedorovich Barabanov (Barabanov), Dmitry Mikhailovich Zamulevich (Zamulevich), and Evgeniy Yurievich Krokhotin (Krokhotin), and Russian businessmen Vladimir Mikhailovich Arkadiev (Arkadiev) and Oleg Vladimirovich Petrov (Petrov)\u2014who are all personally connected to Zaitsau, Varabei, and Aleksin, and represent these oligarchs\u2019 interest in the companies.\n\nOFAC is designating Ruzekspeditsiya, VLATE, Gerasim, Petrov, Barabanov, Zamulevich, Arkadiev, and Krokhotin pursuant to E.O. 14038 for operating or having operated in the transportation sector of the Belarus economy.\n\nDEFENSE SECTOR ENTITIES SUPPORTING RUSSIAN WAR EFFORT\n\nJoint Stock Company Plant Legmash (Legmash) is a Belarus-based manufacturing plant that has shifted its operations to produce artillery ammunition to supply the Belarusian and Russian armed forces. In May 2024, Lukashenka visited Legmash and alongside Legmash\u2019s Belarusian Director, Vladislav Nikolaevich Pavlenko (Pavlenko), inspected Legmash\u2019s new defense sector operations and commented on Legmash\u2019s importance to the Belarusian defense-industrial sector.\n\nOFAC is designating Legmash and Pavlenko pursuant to E.O. 14038 for operating or having operated in the defense and related materiel sector of the Belarus economy.\n\nKB Unmanned Helicopters (UAVHeli) is a Belarusian unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) developer and manufacturer that specializes in the production of drones for use in the security and defense sectors. Since its inception, UAVHeli has been led by Belarusian businessman Vladimir Vladimirovich Chudakov (Chudakov), who has sold UAVHeli\u2019s products to the Belarusian and Russian defense sectors.\n\nOFAC is designating UAVHeli and Chudakov pursuant to E.O. 14038 for operating or having operated in the defense and related materiel sector of the Belarus economy.\n\nLUKASHENKA\u2019S LUXURY AIRLINER\n\nLukashenka maintains a fleet of Government of Belarus-owned planes that he uses professionally and for his personal leisure. EW-001PB is a Boeing 767-32K(ER) owned by the Government of Belarus and used as part of the fleet of presidential aircraft. OFAC is identifying EW-001PB as property in which Lukashenka, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14038, has an interest. OFAC has previously identified as blocked property several other aircraft in the presidential fleet, including EW-001PA (March 24, 2023) and EW-301PJ (August 9, 2023).\n\nSANCTIONS IMPLICATIONS\n\nAs a result of today\u2019s action, all property and interests in property of the designated persons described above that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked and must be reported to OFAC. In addition, any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, individually or in the aggregate, 50 percent or more by one or more blocked persons are also blocked. Unless authorized by a general or specific license issued by OFAC, or exempt, OFAC\u2019s regulations generally prohibit all transactions by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in property of designated or otherwise blocked persons.\n\nIn addition, financial institutions and other persons that engage in certain transactions or activities with the sanctioned entities and individuals may expose themselves to sanctions or be subject to an enforcement action. The prohibitions include the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any designated person, or the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.\n\nThe power and integrity of OFAC sanctions derive not only from OFAC\u2019s ability to designate and add persons to the SDN List, but also from its willingness to remove persons from the SDN List consistent with the law. The ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish, but to bring about a positive change in behavior. For information concerning the process for seeking removal from an OFAC list, including the SDN List, please refer to OFAC\u2019s Frequently Asked Question 897 here. For detailed information on the process to submit a request for removal from an OFAC sanctions list, please click here.\n\nClick here for more information on the individuals and entities sanctioned today.\n\n###",

        "text": "Election\u2019s Impact on Commercial Real Estate\nInterest rates and optics in an election year\n\nInterest rates and inflation may be top of mind for multifamily investors as election day approaches, but the Federal Reserve bases its decisions solely on economic factors, not political ones.\n\nThe independence of the Fed to manage monetary policy without regard to political considerations is fundamental. The Fed has consistently and repeatedly said its decision to adjust policy rates will be based on evidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward its long-term 2% average target to help maintain this independence and avoid any charges of partisanship.\n\nThe last meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) before the election is September 18. The proximity to the election and recently published quarterly economic projections will add attention to the meeting. But even after September 18, rates could be volatile as the presumed outcome of the election could influence the future of inflation.\n\nPotential housing regulation stability\n\nWhile increased funding for multifamily housing is possible, it\u2019s largely dependent on Congress. Regardless of the next president, however, it\u2019s unlikely housing funding and policies will be rolled back.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve increasingly seen a frustration with the cost of housing across party lines,\u201d said Nick Luettke, Associate Economist at Moody\u2019s CRE.\n\nWhile both parties want more affordable housing, they\u2019re likely to take different approaches. If either party gains control over the House of Representatives, Senate and White House, housing policies could see significant changes.\n\nIt\u2019s a different story with a divided government. \u201cIn that case, federal housing policies will likely remain the same, with the level of political polarization in Congress impacting commercial real estate policymaking more than the presidential election,\u201d Luettke said.\n\nThe election and economy\u2019s impact on infrastructure spending\n\n\u201cWith either outcome, there will likely be continued federal investment via the Infrastructure and Jobs Act into roads, bridges, power and grid, passenger and freight rail, water infrastructure, housing, broadband, airports and more,\u201d Chambless said.\n\nIt\u2019s important to consider the role of Congress here. \u201cInfrastructure spending will likely remain fairly stable should a split Congress and president be elected, with greater expansion or cuts being easier should either party successfully sweep,\u201d Luettke said.\n\nAside from Congressional election outcomes, infrastructure spending often picks up during economic downturns in response to rising unemployment. So there\u2019s also a possibility either administration could pour funding into infrastructure, depending on the economic landscape.\n\nSuch continued investment could benefit commercial real estate. Take modular housing, for example. \u201cModular construction\u2019s factory-like approach really drives costs down,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cThe negative is it\u2019s extremely expensive to move modular housing.\u201d\n\n\u201cInfrastructure spending is likely to depend more on macroeconomic health and whether deficit reduction or a stimulus is more necessary for a struggling labor market,\u201d Luettke said.\n\nReal estate and strategic supply chain spending\n\nLuettke noted that infrastructure legislation related to national security and supporting supply chains is the most vulnerable to geopolitical developments. It\u2019s also the most likely to be favored across administrations and congressional outcomes.\n\nBoth potential administrations appear to be acting tough with China on trade. Homeshoring and nearshoring are likely to continue regardless of election results. Both efforts can help commercial real estate and multifamily reduce development timelines and costs.\n\n\u201cIn the last eight years, conventional wisdom toward free-trade agreements has nearly disappeared,\u201d Luettke said. \u201cInstead, supply chain choices have increasingly been viewed as part of broader strategic relationships combining domestic protectionism of key industries with security,\u201d he said. Both potential administrations are likely to continue this approach.\n\n\u201cThere could be a number of impacts to global supply chains, including the prioritization of domestic investment, implementation of trade tariffs, and rebalanced and renegotiated trading relationships,\u201d Chambless said.",

        "text": "Historic First for California: 16- and 17-Year-Olds\u2026\nIn a historic first for California, the County of Alameda, the City of Oakland, the City of Berkeley, the Oakland Unified School District, and the Berkeley Unified School District are pleased to announce that 16- and 17-year-olds in Oakland and Berkeley will be able to vote in their respective elections for school board in November 2024.\n\nThis historic expansion of the local franchise is thanks to the passage of Measure Y1, approved by over 70 percent of voters in Berkeley in 2016, and of Measure QQ, approved in 2020 with 2/3 support of Oakland voters.\n\nThe Alameda County Registrar of Voters is using California\u2019s pre-registration system\u2013the system that allows 16- and 17-year-olds to pre-register to vote in California as a whole\u2013as the system to register 16- and 17-year-olds to vote in their local school board races in Oakland or Berkeley. Therefore, a resident of Oakland or Berkeley who is 16- or 17- years old and who is otherwise eligible must use California\u2019s pre-registration system (https://registertovote.ca.gov) to register to vote as a \u201cyouth voter.\u201d Any 16- or 17- year-old residing in Oakland or Berkeley who previously pre-registered to vote will be automatically registered as a youth voter.\n\n\u201cI am very pleased to have the technology and processes in place to deliver youth voting, passed by the voters of Berkeley and Oakland through Measures Y1 and QQ,\u201d said Alameda County Registrar of Voters Tim Dupuis. \u201cThis has never been done before in California and we had to make sure that it was done properly. I would like to thank the Board of Supervisors for their support in helping make it possible for 16- and 17-year-olds in Oakland and Berkeley to vote for school board in November 2024.\u201d\n\n\u201cVoting is not just a right but a civic duty, and extending this right to 16- and 17-year-olds will foster a culture of civic participation from an early age. I am grateful to Oakland Council President Nikki Bas, Councilmember Rebecca Kaplan, and the Oakland City Clerk\u2019s team for all their hard work and leadership to make this new program a reality,\u201d said Oakland Mayor Sheng Thao.\n\n\u201cYoung people are directly affected by the decisions made by their local school boards,\u201d said OUSD Board of Education President Sam Davis. \u201cLowering the voting age to 16 ensures that their perspectives are represented in the democratic process and will compel local politicians to address their concerns.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy giving 16-17 year-olds the right to vote about their education, we help to create lifelong voters who are more likely to participate in future local and national elections,\u201d said Berkeley Mayor Jesse Arregu\u00edn. \u201cEarly involvement fosters a sense of civic duty and strengthens our democracy for generations to come.\u201d\n\n\u201cBerkeley has been working to bring youth voting to fruition for several years,\u201d said Berkeley Unified School Board President Ana Vasudeo.\u201d We\u2019re excited to empower our youth to exercise one of their most important civic duties this November.\u201d\n\nThe technical capability enabling youth to vote in this election is the culmination of years of work by the Registrar of Voters with support and direction from the Alameda County Board of Supervisors, the four involved local jurisdictions (City of Oakland, City of Berkeley, Oakland USD, and Berkeley USD), the team from Runbeck Elections Services, Inc. (the vendor for Alameda County\u2019s election management system), and community-based advocacy organizations. What might have seemed simple in 2016 when Measure Y1 was first passed turned out to require a complicated process in which every aspect of the election\u2014from voter registration to ballot mailing to ballot counting\u2014needed to be mapped, programmed, and tested specifically for youth voters. This process, while lengthy, was necessary to ensure the integrity of the election for both youth voters and traditional voters.\n\nKey Information/Dates for the November 5, 2024, election:\n\nVoter Information Guides will be mailed to all voters, including youth voters, starting Thursday, September 26, 2024.\n\nAll voters, including youth voters, will be mailed a mail ballot starting the week of October 7, 2024.\n\nThe last day for all voters, including youth voters, to register online to vote is Monday, October 21, 2024, although all voters, including youth voters, may register to vote in person at the Registrar of Voters\u2019 office (1225 Fallon St., Oakland) through Election Day.\n\nThe last day for all voters, including youth voters, to request a mail ballot replacement is Tuesday, October 29, 2024.\n\nIn addition, from when early voting begins on Monday, October 7, 2024, through Election Day on Tuesday, November 5, 2024, youth voters can vote in person at the Registrar of Voters\u2019 office (1225 Fallon St., Oakland).\n\nWithin the United States, only five small municipalities in Maryland (with a combined total population of all ages of only around 80,000) permit youth voting. Given the larger populations of Berkeley and Oakland, the potential youth vote in each of these two California cities is greater than all the Maryland municipalities combined.",

        "text": "Joe Biden explains why he dropped out of White House race\nBiden explains why he dropped out of White House race\n\nBiden on stepping aside: 'We must defeat Trump'\n\nUS President Joe Biden says he dropped out of his re-election bid because he feared that the intraparty battle over his candidacy would be a \"real distraction\" for Democrats and that his highest priority was to defeat Donald Trump in November. In his first interview since quitting the race, Mr Biden, 81, said he had \u201cno serious problem\u201d with his health. He blamed his poor debate performance on being sick at the time, and brushed off concerns about his age and mental acuity. The US president pledged to campaign for Kamala Harris saying he was going to do whatever his vice-president \"thinks I can do to help most\". \u201cWe must, we must, we must defeat Trump,\u201d he told US broadcaster CBS News.\n\nMr Biden said if he had continued his campaign, the presidential contest would have gone \u201cdown to the wire\u201d. \"A number of my Democratic colleagues in the House and Senate thought that I was going to hurt them in the races,\" he said. \"And I was concerned if I stayed in the race, that would be the topic. You\u2019d be interviewing me about, Why did Nancy Pelosi say, why did so \u2014 and I thought it\u2019d be a real distraction.\u201d Former House speaker Nancy Pelosi was widely reported to have led the push to oust Mr Biden - a claim she has not exactly denied - after his halting debate performance against Trump on 27 June. During the pre-recorded interview broadcast Sunday, Mr Biden misspoke several times but generally seemed more coherent than during the live televised debate. He chalked up his poor debate performance to illness \u2013 previously he\u2019s also mentioned jet lag and lack of rest as factors. As pressure continued to ratchet up, he announced his exit from the race on 21 July. A potential battle to replace him at the top of the Democratic ticket never materialised and party support swiftly coalesced around Vice-President Harris, who has so far outperformed Mr Biden in opinion polls. The president has said he intended to be a bridge to the next generation when he ran for the White House in 2020. \"When I ran the first time, I thought of myself as being a transition president. I can't even say how old I am. It's hard for me to get it out of my mouth.\u201d\n\nAFP President Biden rides his bike through Gordons Pond State Park in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware on Sunday\n\nIn other US election news: Republican vice-presidential candidate and Ohio senator JD Vance has defended a sweeping deportation plan for undocumented migrants if he and Donald Trump are elected.\n\nMr Vance told American broadcaster ABC News that a second Trump administration would start with 1 million people who are in the United States illegally. Government figures indicate that there are around 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country, a figure that has remained largely steady since 2005.\n\nThe Ohio senator said his previous remarks suggesting parents should get additional votes were a \u201cthought experiment\u201d made in response to Democratic Party suggestions about lowering the voting age.\n\nHe said that his comments in 2021 were not a policy proposal and that he did not support extra votes for people with children. \u201cI want us to be more pro-family,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Vice-President Kamala Harris told a crowd in Las Vegas that she supported ending taxes on tips, a proposal also backed by Trump. The battleground state of Nevada is home to a substantial number of voters who work in the hospitality and tourism industry.\n\nAnd following false remarks earlier in the week about the size of his crowds, Donald Trump took to his Truth Social network Sunday to accuse the Harris campaign of creating a \u201cfake photo\u201d of a rally crowd. However photos and videos from the event in question, held in Detroit, show large numbers of people turning out to see the Democratic nominees.\n\nIn the CBS interview, Mr Biden returned to the moment he decided to run against Trump \u2013 when a gathering of far-right activists in Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017 turned deadly. He accused Trump of emboldening racists and the far-right. \u201cEvery other time the Ku Klux Klan has been involved they wore hoods so they're not identified,\u201d he said. \u201cUnder his presidency, they came out of those woods with no hoods, knowing they had an ally.\u201d He also repeated his concerns about what might happen after November\u2019s election, saying he was \u201cnot confident at all\u201d that there will be a peaceful transfer of power if Ms Harris defeats Trump. He went on to say that he was concerned that there would be violence if Trump loses the election. \"He means what he says,\u201d Mr Biden said. \u201cWe don't take him seriously. He means it. All the stuff about, 'If we lose, it'll be a bloodbath\u2019.\u201d \"He's a genuine danger to American security,\u201d Mr Biden said. Trump commented at a rally in March that it would \u201cbe a bloodbath for the country\u201d if he loses, however his campaign has repeatedly said he was referring to the economy and the auto industry and that Democrats have taken the quote out of context. At the same time, the former president has repeatedly insisted, without evidence, that he was cheated out of victory in 2020 and has warned that there will be attempts to \u201crig\u201d the vote this year. He has pledged to pardon some or all of the people convicted for rioting at the US Capitol in January 2021. Mr Biden said he would be campaigning on behalf of Ms Harris and that he had spoken to Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro about touring the state. Mr Biden was born in the working-class city of Scranton, about 120 miles (190km) north-west of New York City. \u201cI'm going to be campaigning in other states as well. And I'm going to do whatever Kamala thinks I can do to help most,\u201d he said.",

        "text": "President Biden explains why he exited 2024 race in \"CBS Sunday Morning\" interview\nPresident Biden, who has long said he ran for the White House in 2020 due to his alarm about former President Donald Trump, decided to exit the 2024 presidential race last month. He says his decision, in part, was driven by his belief that he needed to keep the nation's focus on Trump and unite the Democratic Party ahead of the November election.\n\nIn an interview with \"CBS News Sunday Morning,\" Mr. Biden told CBS News chief election and campaign correspondent Robert Costa more about his historic decision not to seek reelection, echoing his previous statement that he would serve as a transitional figure in American presidential politics.\n\n\"When I ran the first time, I thought of myself as being a transition president,\" Mr. Biden, 81, told Costa. \"I can't even say how old I am \u2013 it's hard for me to get it out of my mouth.\"\n\nBiden expressed support for Vice President Kamala Harris, who is set to be nominated as the Democrats' standard-bearer at the party's national convention in Chicago this month.\n\n\"We must, we must, we must defeat Trump,\" Biden said in the interview, which took place in the Treaty Room in the White House residence.\n\n\"Although it's a great honor to be a president, I think I have an obligation to the country to do what I-- most important thing you can do. And that is \u2014 we must, we must, we must defeat Trump,\" he said.\n\nMr. Biden announced he was exiting the 2024 race and endorsed Harris as the Democratic Party's nominee on Sunday, July 21 \u2014 nearly a month after his debate against Trump, which concerned some of his Democratic colleagues and prompted dozens to call for him to withdraw.\n\nIn an Oval Office address on July 24, Mr. Biden said \"nothing, nothing, can come in the way of saving our democracy,\" including his ambition for a second term.\n\nA CBS News poll released on Aug. 4 showed Harris gaining momentum with a 1-point edge nationally and a tie across the battleground states. Mr. Biden was down by 5 points when he left the race.\n\nHarris is hoping Tim Walz, the upbeat two-term governor of Minnesota, will give her Democratic ticket another boost and help her win over pivotal battleground states.",

He accused Trump of emboldening racists and the far-right.\n\n\u201cEvery other time the Ku Klux Klan has been involved they wore hoods so they're not identified,\u201d he said. \u201cUnder his presidency, they came out of those woods with no hoods, knowing they had an ally.\u201d\n\nHe also repeated his concerns about what might happen after November\u2019s election, saying he was \u201cnot confident at all\u201d that there will be a peaceful transfer of power if Ms Harris defeats Trump.\n\nHe went on to say that he was concerned that there would be violence if Trump loses the election.\n\n\"He means what he says,\u201d Mr Biden said. \u201cWe don't take him seriously. He means it. All the stuff about, 'If we lose, it'll be a bloodbath\u2019.\u201d\n\n\"He's a genuine danger to American security,\u201d Mr Biden said.\n\nTrump commented at a rally in March that it would \u201cbe a bloodbath for the country\u201d if he loses, however his campaign has repeatedly said he was referring to the economy and the auto industry and that Democrats have taken the quote out of context.\n\nAt the same time, the former president has repeatedly insisted, without evidence, that he was cheated out of victory in 2020 and has warned that there will be attempts to \u201crig\u201d the vote this year. He has pledged to pardon some or all of the people convicted for rioting at the US Capitol in January 2021.\n\nMr Biden said he would be campaigning on behalf of Ms Harris and that he had spoken to Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro about touring the state. Mr Biden was born in the working-class city of Scranton, about 120 miles (190km) north-west of New York City.\n\n\u201cI'm going to be campaigning in other states as well. And I'm going to do whatever Kamala thinks I can do to help most,\u201d he said.",

        "text": "Joe Biden reveals reason why he pulled out of race for the White House\nUS President Joe Biden has revealed he dropped out of the race for the White House because Democrats felt his candidacy was \"going to hurt\" their chances of being re-elected.\n\nThe 81-year-old abandoned his campaign in July after months of speculation about his age and his fitness to serve another four years.\n\nConcerns increased among Democrats after a disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump in June and a series of high-profile gaffes.\n\nSenior Democrats, including former US President Barack Obama, expressed their concerns about him running, while former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Mr Biden's long-time friend and ally, urged him to step aside.\n\nAsked on the US news show CBS Sunday Morning why he chose to abandon his campaign, Mr Biden said: \"Look, the polls we had showed that it was a neck and neck race which would have been down to the wire. But what happened was, a number of my Democratic colleagues in the House and Senate thought that I was gonna hurt them in the races.\n\n\"And I was concerned if I stayed in the race, that would be the topic [journalists] would be interviewing me about - 'Why did Nancy Pelosi say [this]? Why did someone [say this]?'\n\n\"And and I thought it would be a real distraction.\"\n\nImage: Joe Biden addresses the nation from the Oval Office about his decision to withdraw from the race. Pic: Reuters\n\nMr Biden added he thought of himself as a \"transition president\" when he ran in 2020, and added: \"I can't even say how old I am. It's hard for me to get out of my mouth.\"\n\nThe US president also said the \"critical issue\" for him is \"maintaining this democracy\".\n\nHe continued: \"Although It's a great honour being president, I think I have an obligation to the country to do the most important thing you can do and that is - we must, we must, we must defeat Trump.\"\n\nIn the interview with CBS' chief election and campaign correspondent Robert Costa, Mr Biden also said he was \"not confident at all\" that there would be a peaceful transfer of power if Mr Trump loses the election.\n\nIt comes after Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol building on 6 January 2021 as they sought to keep him in power two months after his election defeat to Mr Biden.\n\nRead more:\n\nNew vulnerability on display at Trump news conference\n\nWhy Harris picked Tim Walz over 'ambitious' Josh Shapiro\n\nWho is JD Vance?

        "text": "Why is US Election Day on Tuesday\nGeneral or Presidential Elections\n\nThis year, on Tuesday, November 5th, 2024, the next President and Vice President of the United States of America will be elected, as well as 1/3 of the U.S. Senators and all 435 Members of the U.S. House of Representatives will be chosen. Yes, the election will take place on Tuesday.\n\nBut have you ever wondered why the election usually occurs during the week, namely on Tuesday? As always at U.S. Vote Foundation, we've got the answer for you! We're here to help you understand and exercise your voting rights and you can even build your knowledge of U.S. elections at the same time. Read on!\n\nEvery Four Years\n\nEvery four years, the General Election takes place (for a more detailed description of the types of elections, read our blog on types of elections). According to the U.S. Constitution, the U.S. President and Vice President are elected every four years. Furthermore, the U.S. Constitution states that all 435 U.S. House of Representatives members have a term of 2 years, meaning they have to be elected every two years. As for the U.S. Senator, their terms are longer, namely six years.\n\nThis means that one third of the U.S. Senators are up for an election every two years, or 33-34 Senate seats, depending on the year, are vacant. In short, every four years, we've got a major election that can change the direction of the country, depending on the election results.\n\nA Special Tuesday\n\nUnlike most countries that hold their elections on Sundays, the United States of America has its General Election on a special Tuesday. It is the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November. In 2024, the General Election will take place on Tuesday, November 5th, 2024. In 2028, it will be on Tuesday, November 7th, 2028, and in 2032, Election Day will be held on Tuesday, November 2nd, 2032.\n\nOn November 5th, 2024, U.S. citizens will be able to fill 469 seats in the U.S. Congress (1/3 or 34 seats in the U.S. Senate and all 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives) as well as technically elect the electors who elect the new President and Vice President (for more on how U.S. President is elected, read our blog on the Electoral College). But why is the General Election on this particular Tuesday?\n\nAct of the 28th Congress\n\nOn January 23rd, 1845, the U.S. 28th Congress passed a Statue II, Chapter I \"An Act to Establish a Uniform Time for Holding Elections for Electors of President and Vice President in all States of the Union,\" that defined a special Tuesday as Election Day. The Act states,\n\n\"Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the electors of President and Vice President shall be appointed in each State on the Tuesday next after the first Monday in the month of November of the year in which they are to be appointed: Provided, That each State may by law provide for the filling of any vacancy or vacancies which may occur in its college of electors when such college meets to give its electoral vote.\"\n\nThe Act unified the date of the election for all states and fixed it to the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November. This Act is still in effect today and explains why the General Election is on Tuesday. But there is more to the story.\n\nSolving an Important Problem\n\nThe 1845 Act of the 28th Congress solved a significant flaw of the previous election system. Before the federal law of 1845 was passed, all states were allowed to hold elections on any day within 34 days before the first Wednesday in December, when the electors of the Electoral College formerly met. In that system, states that held federal elections earlier within 34-day period published their final election results, and therefore influenced the outcome of the election results in the states that held their federal elections later. As a result, the states that had voted earlier swayed the results in the states that had their elections later. Deciding on a uniform day as Election Day has helped to remove the undue influence of states that completed their voting prior to that day.\n\nTuesday was chosen as Election Day for convenience. According to History, agrarian culture explains why Tuesday in November was selected.\n\n\"Tuesday was selected as the first and most convenient day of the week to hold elections. Farm culture also explains why Election Day always falls in November. Spring and early summer elections were thought to interfere with the planting season, and late summer and early fall elections overlapped with the harvest. That left the late fall month of November\u2014after the harvest was complete, but before the arrival of harsh winter weather\u2014as the best choice.\"\n\nIn short, because the majority of Americans were farmers at the time the federal law was passed, Tuesday in November worked best with the planting season. Tuesday gave U.S. citizens enough time (one day each way) to travel to the polling stations and back. As for Sunday, it was impractical because the majority of Americans attended church; and Wednesdays were market days for farmers, which made things impractical. So, Tuesday was chosen. Tuesday also stayed until nowadays.\n\nSo, next time you wonder about the famous second Tuesday after the first Monday in November, you know the whole story. You can impress everyone! Now we have a question for you! Have you registered to vote on Tuesday, November 5th, 2024 yet? If you haven't, what are you waiting for?!\n\nWhat Options to Election Day are Available?\n\nIf you are an overseas voter and voting from abroad, the good news is, voting is very convenient because you receive your ballot prior to Election Day. If you've requested it, overseas ballots start to be sent out 45 days prior to the election!\n\nCheck Out Our Overseas Voter Tools and Services Now!\n\n\n\nIf you are in the U.S. and voting domestically and finding that Election Day on Tuesday is not so convenient - most states have options! You can potentially vote by absentee ballot, or vote early before Election Day.\n\nCan I Vote Early in My State? See the Early Voting Dates Chart\n\nWhat Are the Ways I Can Vote in My State?

The contest carries tremendous implications for foreign policy. While the candidates\u2019 approaches to conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza may be two of the most discussed foreign policy matters at stake, future US-Iran relations also heavily depend on the outcome of this election.

This article will compare the Iran policies of the Trump and Biden-Harris administrations and will evaluate their likely impacts on Iran policy in a potential future term.\n\nPrevious Campaign Rhetoric\n\nBefore President Biden exited the race, in the sole presidential debate thus far, the candidates sparred for roughly 90 minutes on a wide range of issues. Of 17,652 words spoken during the debate, less than two hundred related to Iran, with an approximately even split between the candidates. Both Trump and Biden left the stage without giving any promise or indication of what a second term of their Iran policy would be like. Rather, they spent most of their time touting their \u201cstrength\u201d on Iran and criticizing the other as weak. As expected, Trump championed his \u2018maximum pressure\u2019 policy, arguing \u201cIran was broke with me\u2026 They had no money for Hamas. They had no money for anything. No money for terror.\u201d Later, he continued: \u201c\u2026the whole world is blowing up under [Biden].\u201d This furthers previous attempts by the Trump campaign to claim that the October 7th attack would not have happened under his leadership, and that Biden\u2019s relaxing of sanctions directly contributed to it. This fits with Trump\u2019s overall argument that Biden is responsible for violence in Afghanistan, Ukraine, Gaza, and elsewhere. Weeks later at the Republican National Convention, Trump continued these lines of rhetoric - blaming the president for Iran\u2019s alleged newfound economic achievements and status as a nuclear threshold state. Again, notably, Trump did not make any pledges on how he would handle Iran in a second term.\n\nFor Biden\u2019s part, in the debate against Trump he claimed the Trump administration\u2019s assassination of Qassem Soleimani resulted in retaliation by Iran with the largest ever ballistic missile attack on U.S. forces abroad, which caused traumatic brain injuries to 110 service members, and that Trump \u201c[did] nothing about it.\u201d Biden also criticized Trump for referring to the soldiers\u2019 injuries as mere \u201cheadaches.\u201d To assert his own strength on the matter, Biden notedthat he was \u201c\u2026the guy that organized the world against Iran when they had a full-blown\u2026 missile attack on Israel,\u201d referring to Iran\u2019s April 2024 launching of over 300 missiles and drones on Israel in response to Israel\u2019s attack on its consulate in Damascus.\n\nNow that Kamala Harris has taken Biden\u2019s place atop the Democratic ticket, many expect her to continue to align with Biden on many foreign policy issues that she held throughout her term as vice president. However, as of the writing of this article, neither Trump nor Harris have issued a clear roadmap of how they would handle Iran moving forward. Most notably, neither has signaled support for a potential revival of the JCPOA or taken any stance on the future of Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\n\nIndeed the days of the JCPOA may be long over. While both Biden and Trump \u2013 before each was elected \u2013 claimed that they would replace the JCPOA with a better, longer-lasting deal, neither administration was able to accomplish this task. Iran has since neared the status of a \u201cthreshold state\u201d \u2013 having the capacity to build a nuclear weapon without actively attempting to make one. Reports by the IAEA and other partner nations indicate Iran has roughly 833kg of uranium enriched between 20 and 60 percent \u2013 enough to create three nuclear devices if it was further enriched to the weapons-grade benchmark of 90%. In March 2023, then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Mark Milley concluded Iran would need 10-15 days to enrich enough uranium to produce a nuclear weapon, and a few more months to assemble it. After four years of President Trump\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d strategy and nearly the same time of President Biden\u2019s so-called \u201clow boil\u201d strategy, the United States is in no stronger of a negotiating position than it has been since the fall of the JCPOA.\n\nWhichever candidate is elected, the next administration will be dealing with an interesting state of affairs in Iran. After the unexpected death of then-Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash in May 2024, new elections were held in Iran with reform candidate Masoud Pezeshkian winning. As a result, Iran now has its first reformist government since the JCPOA was inked nearly ten years ago, presenting a unique opportunity for rapprochement should the next U.S. President accept the challenge.\n\nPresident Trump and \u201cMaximum Pressure\u201d\n\nDuring his initial run for the White House in 2016, Trump campaigned on exiting the JCPOA, describing it as a \u201cdisaster\u201d and \u201cthe worst deal ever.\u201d After taking office, Trump was then required by the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act (INARA) to certify or not certify Iran\u2019s compliance with the terms of the deal every 90 days. While he certified Iran\u2019s compliance in April and July of 2017, he ultimately declined to do so in October. This decision aligned with a series of personnel changes in his administration, from the likes of the deal-supporting Rex Tillerson to the more hawkish John Bolton and Mike Pompeo. Then, in May 2018, Trump officially announced the U.S.\u2019s withdrawal from the JCPOA.\n\nAt the outset of Trump\u2019s term, Iran had been complying with the highly restrictive terms of the JCPOA for several years. It had limited its uranium enrichment levels to well below weapons grade, cut its centrifuges by two-thirds, and reduced its stockpile of enriched uranium. Even after the American pullout from the deal, it still abided by its terms until over one year after the U.S. withdrawal. At that point, Iran still maintained that it would resume compliance if the United States and other parties to the agreement returned to their commitments of sanctions reduction. By the end of 2020, Iran had increased its enrichment to 20% purity, up from the 3.67% permitted by the deal.\n\nTo pressure Iran back to the negotiating table, the Trump administration commenced its so-called \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d strategy. Maximum pressure was designed to levy enough sanctions on Iran that it would then feel such an economic burden that it would have no choice but to negotiate. Maximum pressure was also intended to limit the Islamic Republic\u2019s available funds to use for sponsoring terrorism or bolstering its nuclear program. Trump levied over 1,500 sanctions on Iran, going beyond those set by the Obama administration to target wide-ranging areas of Iran\u2019s political and economic spheres. The sanctions impacted everything from senior administration and banking officials to military and IRGC members to key aspects of Iran\u2019s economy. It restricted Iran\u2019s oil exports to less than 400,000 barrels per day\u2013 down from over 2.1 million barrels exported while the JCPOA was in effect. Iran immediately felt the impacts of \u2018maximum pressure.\u2019 The year following was described as the \u201ctoughest\u201d in the Islamic Republic\u2019s history. In the two years following the American pullout, the Iranian rial dropped in value by 600%. Oil exports \u2013 which account for up to 70% of Iran\u2019s government revenue - dropped to a historic low, costing Iran roughly $200 billion in oil revenues. Its gross reserves fell from $70 billion in 2017 to $4 billion in 2020.\n\nDespite this pressure, however, Iran refused to concede to American demands and responded by developing an \u201ceconomy of resistance\u201d \u2013 diversifying its economy to rely less on oil revenues and becoming more able to skirt oil exporting restrictions through a \u201cshadow fleet\u201d of unmarked tankers. \u2018Maximum pressure\u2019 also drew high levels of scrutiny from international rights watchdogs due to its impact on Iranian civilians. Human Rights Watch wrote that the campaign \u201c[posed] a serious threat to Iranians\u2019 right to health and access to essential medicines,\u201d including epilepsy and chemotherapy medications. This report cited the U.S.\u2019s restrictions on Iran\u2019s banking system creating high barriers to purchasing critical supplies needed for Iran\u2019s healthcare and other industries.\n\nTrump and Iran\u2019s Military\n\nUS-Iran relations, especially in the past two decades, have been defined either by political/economic matters or around Iran\u2019s military capability and growing capacity to build a nuclear bomb. In the military/nuclear arena, much of the US\u2019 focus relates to its alliance with and defense of Israel. For its part, in Iran, a core part of the country\u2019s foreign policy over the past few decades has been to build a so-called \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d against Israel. And, while Iran has largely conducted its countering of Israeli influence through a series of military proxies (Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, the Houthi rebels in Yemen, and a series of militias in Iraq and Syria), more recently in April 2024, Iran initiated a stunning attack of more than 300 missiles and drones on Israel directly, in response to Israel\u2019s attack on its consulate in Damascus.\n\nGiven the United States\u2019 ardent support for Israel, recent flare-ups in the Middle East have heightened the need for US Presidential candidates to promote their military toughness towards Iran as evidenced by some of their statements in the June 27 presidential debate. While both Trump and Biden (and now Harris) may all make similar \u201ctough\u201d postures while campaigning, it is important to recall that the Trump and Biden-Harris administrations actually had significantly different policies.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s Iran policy notably culminated eighteen days before he left office, with the U.S. assassination of Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani. Soleimani was head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps\u2019 Quds Force, a key figure in Iranian foreign policy, and chief architect of the Axis of the Resistance. He has been cited as the \u201cmost important person in Iran after Ayatollah Khamenei.\u201d\n\nThe strike on Soleimani, however, was simply the peak of a tense eight month period following the fall of the JCPOA. It was also a demonstration of Trump\u2019s willingness to use force to achieve his ends. Before taking this military action, his \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign had involved significant diplomatic and economic measures beyond those of prior administrations. For example, in April 2019, the Trump administration designated the IRGC as a foreign terrorist organization \u2013 the first time the U.S. had placed such a label on a foreign government entity. In the following months, the U.S. deployed increasingly more forces to the Middle East to deter Iranian aggression \u2013 including troops, a Patriot missile battery, and a carrier strike group. As Trump continued to increase sanctions on Iran, Iran responded by breaking more bounds of the JCPOA, and by increasing attacks on U.S. troops in Iraq and other areas.\n\nThe exact rationale for the January 2nd strike on Soleimani has been disputed and debated. Some sources say that Pentagon officials offered Trump the option of doing so as a contrast to make other options seem more reasonable in comparison. The day following the strike, President Trump spoke, offering allegations that Soleimani was planning attacks on American military positions and diplomats abroad. Trump officials also compared Soleimani\u2019s killing to that of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi three months prior. Regardless of the reason, assassinating Soleimani was a further demonstration of Trump\u2019s strongman policy in attempting to bend Iran\u2019s will towards U.S. interests. In response, Ayatollah Khamenei pledged \u201cforceful revenge,\u201d and did so on January 7th by launching a barrage of missiles causing brain injuries to 110 servicemembers. Thirteen days later, under lightning-high tensions, President Biden took office and sought to change course on Iran.\n\nThe Biden-Harris Iran Policy: Attempts at a New Deal\n\nBefore the Biden-Harris administration took office, Biden campaigned on making an \u201cunshakable commitment\u201d to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. His plan for achieving this, however, was misguided. Despite 150 members of Congress signing on to a letter to the President urging him to rejoin the JCPOA without any preconditions, Biden instead opted to place the impetus on Iran to rejoin the deal, saying he would consider sanctions removal if and only if Iran immediately returned to full compliance of the agreement as it was pre-withdrawal. Experts noted that Biden likely viewed Trump\u2019s four years of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d as leverage he did not want to give up by acquiescing to Iranian demands for sanctions removal. This strategy was problematic. American credibility has declined since the signing of the JCPOA. A hasty and catastrophic withdrawal from Afghanistan, failure to honor the nuclear deal, wavering commitments to Ukraine, and other incidents have made other countries skeptical of the United States\u2019 ability to hold a diplomatic commitment through multiple, often disputing administrations. As members of Congress noted, \u201cAmericans have seen first-hand how withdrawing from multilateral agreements and abandoning our allies jeopardizes our national security goals.\u201d With the volatility of American domestic politics, Iran in particular was skeptical of Biden\u2019s offer and declined. U.S. diplomatic inconsistency reinforced Iran\u2019s already anti-west sentiments and view that the United States was not to be trusted.\n\nAlso at the beginning of the Biden-Harris administration, a group of over 50 foreign policy and national security experts penned a similar letter, highlighting the fact that Biden did not need congressional approval to rejoin the JCPOA. He could rejoin via executive order, just as he did to rejoin the Paris climate agreement that President Trump had also exited. Instead of placing the impetus on Iran, President Biden could have taken the burden on himself to rebuild the trust that his country had broken. Any such move, however, even before the war in Gaza and Houthi attacks in the Red Sea, would have come at a significant political cost for Biden so early in his presidency. Instead, he opted for the politically safer option that resulted in no new deal.\n\nThree months into Biden\u2019s term in April 2021, negotiations began in earnest for a successor to the JCPOA. In these discussions, Biden sought increased concessions from Tehran, including a curbing of Iran\u2019s cruise missile program and a reduction of Iran\u2019s presence in the region \u2013 two core aspects of Iran\u2019s foreign policy. A week into negotiations, Israel attempted to sabotage them by bombing Natanz, a major Iranian nuclear site. This set back Tehran\u2019s nuclear capacity and undercut its leverage in the negotiations. In response, Ayatollah Khamenei increased uranium enrichment up to 60% purity, far above the 3-5% needed for civilian purposes that Iran alleges their program is for, and extremely close to weapons-grade.\n\nThe United States and Iran were at an impasse. President Biden demanded Iran first return to compliance before potential sanctions removal. Iran demanded the United States remove sanctions before they would dismantle any of their nuclear program. Then, in June of 2021, President Rouhani and Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif \u2013 both individuals whose support was instrumental in accomplishing the original deal \u2013 left office, leading to over a year of stagnated talks before both parties abandoned them in July 2022.\n\nThe Biden-Harris Post-Deal Strategy \u2013 \u201cLow Boil\u201d\n\nAfter this initial attempt at reconciliation, the Biden-Harris Iran strategy can be best described, as an anonymous official familiar with the matter put it, \u201clow boil.\u201d The administration has sought neither to antagonize nor concede, responding to Iran\u2019s actions proportionally. Their primary goal was simple: use minimal coercion to keep Iran in check, scoring marginal wins when possible, and keeping relations from spiraling out of control. Not long after the failed renegotiations, Biden spoke out in favor of the widespread protests that erupted after the death of Mahsa Amini in September 2022. His first major action regarding Iran followed a year later when Washington and Tehran inked a blockbuster deal to free five American hostages wrongfully detained by the regime in exchange for unfreezing $6 Bn in Iranian oil revenue being held in South Korean bank accounts. This deal was part of a key aspect of Biden-Harris foreign policy \u2013 bringing home Americans held wrongfully abroad. They have freed 35 such hostages to date.\n\nThe hostage exchange deal came under heavy scrutiny, with one Republican calling it a \u201cransom.\u201d GOP Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AK) called the deal a \u201ccraven act of appeasement,\u201d alleging that Iran would then use the \u201cill-gotten gains\u201d to fund terrorism and attack U.S. troops. The newly released funds were restricted to only humanitarian purposes, but Republican detractors countered with allegations that additional humanitarian funding would then, in turn, free up other funds to be used for malicious purposes. This scrutiny intensified after the October 7th Hamas attack on Israel, with House majority leader and then-Speaker candidate Steve Scalise writing via X/Twitter: \u201cThe Biden Administration must be held accountable for its appeasement of these Hamas terrorists, including handing over billions of dollars to them and their Iranian backers.\u201d Shortly after, the Biden-Harris administration announced they and Qatar, where the funds are held, would block Iran\u2019s access for the foreseeable future. In response, Iran criticized the re-freezing, claiming in a statement: \u201cThe money rightfully belongs to the people of Iran\u2026 [for] all essential and non-sanctioned requisites for the Iranians.\u201d\n\nThe Biden-Harris \u201clow boil\u201d strategy has carried over into the wide-ranging proxy war between the U.S., Israel, and U.S.-backed militias against Iran and its Axis of Resistance. In February 2023, in response to three American soldiers being killed by IRGC-backed groups in Jordan, Biden ordered a strike on 85 targets in Iraq and Syria. The targets largely comprised intelligence centers, logistics facilities, and other locations supporting the IRGC and the Axis of Resistance. After Iran famously fired over 300 drones, rockets, and missiles toward Israel in April 2023, Biden\u2019s administration stepped up in Israel\u2019s defense, but strongly discouraged Israel from retaliating, stopping any further escalation from an already near-boiling point.\n\nWhere Does Harris Stand?\n\nEver since Harris rose into the national political spotlight during her 2020 presidential run, she has largely mirrored Biden\u2019s stances on Iran. Many expect her to continue these leanings if she is elected in November. During her initial run for president, she called Trump\u2019s exiting of the deal \u201creckless\u201d and pledged to rejoin the agreement, conditional on Iran\u2019s return to compliance. She has also shared Biden\u2019s desire not to escalate matters, criticizing Trump in January 2020 via X/Twitter, claiming that his assassination of Soleimani \u201cput more American lives at risk.\u201d Most recently as Vice President, she mirrored Biden\u2019s stern message to Iran in response to its missile attack on Israel. Harris has only notably diverged from Biden in one key area regarding Iran: Israel. Harris has been slightly more critical of Israel in its war against Hamas, which could signal a potentially less strict stance against Iran.\n\nOpportunities for the Next Administration\n\nSince the Iranian revolution in 1979, there have been limited opportunities for rapprochement between the US and Iran. In what sometimes has seemed like tragic comedy, both countries have historically alternated in their desire to negotiate with the other. These alternations in desire have rarely coincided. Iranian President Mohamed Khatami (1997-2005) and U.S. President Bill Clinton achieved the most significant thawing in relations since the revolution, with Clinton penning a letter to Tehran and Khatami calling Clinton \u201ccourageous\u201d for his efforts. However, shortly after, the Bush administration named Iran as part of its \u201cAxis of Evil,\u201d citing its sponsorship of terrorism and pursuit of nuclear weapons. Little progress was made between the two nations until the Barack Obama and Hassan Rouhani administrations negotiated the JCPOA from 2012-15. There are two things in common between these two d\u00e9tentes. First, a moderate was in Iranian presidential office who was willing to enter talks. The second is that the U.S. president was a Democrat in his second term. In recent history, Democratic presidents have been much more amenable to striking deals with Tehran, and even more so in their second terms.\n\nIf Kamala Harris wins in November, a third such opportunity will take place. Throughout Biden\u2019s tenure and after JCPOA renegotiations broke down in 2022, he has consistently chosen the least politically costly option to keep Iran-US relations on \u201clow boil.\u201d However, if reelected, Biden\u2019s successor in Harris would be in a uniquely strong position to pursue a d\u00e9tente \u2013 potentially achieving a new JCPOA, which Biden and Harris initially campaigned on in 2020. Of course, negotiations with Iran often come with domestic political fallout, and any sort of concessions made must be done at a not insignificant expense of political capital. As a lame-duck president, Biden would have had to worry much less about the potential political fallout of his actions. While Harris is not in as formidable a position given her ability to run for a second term, she would still be inhabiting an interesting middle-ground of having represented the previous Biden-Harris administration as VP, and also beginning her own first term as President.\n\nMost importantly for the next administration, as described above, Iran has recently elected a moderate president. Masoud Pezeshkian campaigned on better relations with the West, including pledging to renegotiate a nuclear deal to alleviate the sanctions\u2019 burden on Iran\u2019s economy. Pezeshkian also notably allied with former foreign minister Javad Zarif, one of the key players behind the initial inking of the JCPOA in 2015. Together in a foreign policy roundtable, Pezeshkian and Zarif argued that re-engagement with Western institutions is a must for improving Iran\u2019s restricted financial status. Pezeshkian\u2019s somewhat unexpected victory is a sign that Iran has, at least, some appetite for such change, and a goal of improving conditions, which have been worsened by Western sanctions.\n\nUnfortunately for US-Iran relations, many factors currently cloud this possibility for rapprochement. The United States continues to clash with Iran-backed Houthi rebels over attacks in the Red Sea, which U.S. Navy officials have said Iran is \u201cvery directly involved\u201d in. Iran recently sent a massive barrage of missiles directly at Israel, the United States\u2019 chief ally in the region. The war in Ukraine (where Iran\u2019s military support for Russia in its war on Ukraine is at a \u201cnew level\u201d) has also heightened American popular distaste for working with Tehran. Furthermore, the status of the war in Gaza will have a determining impact on US-Iran relations. The two powers stand opposite each other in the conflict \u2013 however, both parties are actively working towards a ceasefire. US-Iran tensions have certainly been strained by the war. However, collaboration on a ceasefire deal could pave the way for further small steps towards better relations.\n\nConclusion\n\nIran now has a window of opportunity in which it may seek rapprochement with the United States. However, in our view, this option requires a victory by Harris in the 2024 elections - something which Iran does not seem to expect. Prior to Iran\u2019s presidential election, the six approved candidates \u2013 Pezeshkian and five hardliners \u2013 debated over who would best counter a second Trump presidency. Neither Biden nor Harris were mentioned once in the debates. Candidate and cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi used Trump\u2019s image in his campaign posters, with one reading \u201cThe person who can stand in front of Trump is me.\u201d One foreign policy expert noted that the hardliner candidates believe their strength will best deter Trump, while moderates assert that a hardline position will provoke harsher sanctions and possibly trigger a repeat of the woeful economic conditions that followed Trump\u2019s maximum pressure campaign.\n\nThe potential for a second Trump presidency has already raised concern among many in the Iranian political establishment. Under a second Trump administration, a return to the JCPOA or a similar such deal would be extremely unlikely as Trump made his views on the JCPOA clear when he withdrew from it and made minimal attempts to return. Notably, Trump\u2019s dominating victory in the 2024 Republican presidential primaries aligned with an almost 20% drop in the value of the Iranian rial, suggesting that if Trump were to win, he will continue his maximum pressure campaign. Moreover, Israel may feel emboldened to further engage Iran or its proxies militarily. Indeed, one of the unfortunate outcomes of a four-year \u201clow boil\u201d strategy from the Biden administration, may be that adding a Trump presidency to the mix will lead to a complete boiling over of conflicts in Iran and the broader Middle East.",

        "text": "President Biden speaks on the stakes of the 2024 election, and on his place in history\nIn his first interview since withdrawing from his re-election bid last month, President Biden told \"CBS Sunday Morning\" that he made his decision, in part, so that the Democratic Party could fully concentrate on what he believes is an urgent task at hand: preventing former President Donald Trump from regaining the White House.\n\nSpeaking with CBS News chief election & campaign correspondent Robert Costa, Mr. Biden said that he made his historic decision at his family home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, in late July, just weeks after his debate with Trump, which caused concern in some Democratic circles.\n\n\"The polls we had showed that it was a neck-and-neck race, would have been down to the wire,\" Mr. Biden said. \"But what happened was, a number of my Democratic colleagues in the House and Senate thought that I was gonna hurt them in the races. And I was concerned if I stayed in the race, that would be the topic. You'd be interviewing me about 'Why did Nancy Pelosi say\u2026' 'Why did so-and-so\u2026' And I thought it'd be a real distraction, number one.\n\n\"Number two, when I ran the first time, I thought of myself as being a transition President. I can't even say how old I am; it's hard for me to get it outta my mouth. But things got moving so quickly, it didn't happen.\"\n\nAdded to that combination, he said, was \"the critical issue for me still \u2013 it's not a joke \u2013 maintaining this democracy. I thought it was important. Because, although it's a great honor being president, I think I have an obligation to the country to do what [is] the most important thing you can do, and that is, we must, we must, we must defeat Trump.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden. CBS News\n\nPresident Biden announced his decision on Sunday, July 21, and addressed the nation from the Oval Office three days later, saying that he would not let anything, even \"personal ambition,\" get in the way of \"saving our democracy.\"\n\nFollowing his speech, he was joined by members of his family. Asked what he told them after his historic address, Mr. Biden replied, \"It's what they said to me. They said \u2013 my grandchildren call me Pop, my children call me Dad. And they said they were proud, and it mattered to me a lot.\"\n\nCosta then asked about the president's late son, Beau Biden, who died in 2015. \"When I saw you with your family in the Oval, I wondered, is he thinking of Beau, too?\"\n\nMr. Biden paused. \"Look, I can honestly say that I think of him all the time. Whenever I have a decision that's really hard to make, I literally ask myself, 'What would Beau do?' He should be sitting here being interviewed, not me. He was really a fine man. You know, Beau was committed to my staying committed. We had a conversation toward the end when he was \u2026 we, everybody, we knew he wasn't going to live. And he said, 'Dad, I know, we know what's gonna happen. I'm gonna be okay, Dad. I'm all right. I'm not afraid. But Dad, you gotta make me a promise.' I said, 'What's that, Beau?' He said, 'I know when it happens, you're gonna want to quit. You're not gonna stay engaged \u2026. Look at me. Look at me, Dad. Give me your word as a Biden. When I go, you'll stay engaged. Give me your word. Give me your word.' And I did.\n\n\"And that's why \u2013 I had not planned on running after he died, and then Charlottesville happened.\"\n\nOn August 12, 2017, white supremacist demonstrations in Charlottesville, Virginia turned deadly when Heather Heyer, a civil rights activist, was murdered in what the Justice Department called a \"hate-inspired act of domestic terrorism.\"\n\nMr. Biden has long traced his decision to run in 2020 to that moment \u2013 the beginning of his journey to the presidency.\n\nCosta asked, \"As you look at American democracy seven years later, how do you see it?\"\n\n\"When I spoke to the mom who lost her daughter as a consequence of neo-Nazis and right [wing], white supremacists coming out of fields in America with torches, carrying Nazi banners, singing the same, sick antisemitic bile that was sung in Germany in the '30s, and when her daughter was killed, the press went to then-President Trump and said, 'What do you think?' He said, 'There are very fine people on both sides.' I knew then, I knew I had to do something. And that's why I decided to run, because democracy was literally at stake.\"\n\nMr. Biden explained that the Republican nominee's talk underscores his concerns that a second Trump term would undermine democracy.\n\n\"He evidenced everything that we thought,\" Mr. Biden said. \"Now, January 6th, attack on the Capitol, he talks about now, because he now talks about making sure they're all, you know, let out of prison. He's gonna pardon them. Think of this. Every other time the Ku Klux Klan has been involved they wore hoods so they're not identified. Under his presidency, they came out of those woods with no hoods, knowing they had an ally. That's how I read it. They knew they had an ally in the White House. And he stepped up for them.\"\n\nMr. Biden said he is not confident that there would be a peaceful transfer of power should Trump [who refused to acknowledge his election loss in 2020] lose in November to Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n\"If Trump wins ... I mean, if Trump loses, I'm not confident at all,\" Mr. Biden said. \"He means what he says. We don't take him seriously. He means it. All the stuff about, 'If we lose, it'll be a bloodbath \u2026' Look what they're trying to do now in the local election districts where people count the votes. They're putting people in place in states that they're gonna 'count the votes,' right?\"\n\nRepeating his familiar maxim about politics in a democracy, President Biden said, \"You can't love your country only when you win.\"\n\nTrump has said his remarks on Charlottesville were not intended to praise white nationalists, and that he was warning of economic carnage when he said \"bloodbath.\"\n\nBut Trump isn't the only thing on Mr. Biden's mind, with five months left in his presidency.\n\nAsked if he believes a ceasefire is possible in Israel's war with Hamas before he leaves office, Mr. Biden replied, \"Yes. It's still possible. The plan I put together, endorsed by the G7, endorsed by the U.N. Security Council, et cetera, is still viable. And I'm working literally every single day \u2013 and my whole team \u2013 to see to it that it doesn't escalate into a regional war. But it easily can.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden with CBS News' Robert Costa. CBS News\n\nWhen Mr. Biden entered office in early 2021, he had an ambitious agenda. Costa said, \"Some Senators told me, in March of 2021, you took them into the Oval Office and pointed up at FDR's portrait and said, 'We're going big. We're going in that direction.'\"\n\n\"I did,\" Mr. Biden said. \"And we have, with the great help of so many people. Look, democracy works. And it was very important to prove that it worked, prove that it worked. I mean, look at what we've been able to do: We created 16 million jobs, I mean, real new jobs. We've gotten around a brink of having the private sector invest over a trillion dollars \u2013 a trillion dollars \u2013 in the American economy. One of the things I fought for as a Senator for a long time was to change the dynamic of how we grow the economy, not from the top down, but from the bottom up. The idea of trickle-down economics doesn't work, in my view.\"\n\nAsked if he would project that pride in his administration's record by going on the campaign trail with Harris, Mr. Biden said yes. \"I talk to her frequently, and by the way, I've known her running mate is a great guy. As we say, if we grew up in the same neighborhood, we'd have been friends. He's my kind of guy. He's real, he's smart. I've known him for several decades. I think it's a hell of a team.\"\n\n\"To those who have expressed skepticism about how much you'll be on the trail, or about the rest of your term, raised questions about your health, what do you say to them?\" asked Costa.\n\n\"All I can say is, 'Watch.' That's all,\" Mr. Biden replied. \"Look, I had a really, really bad day in that debate because I was sick. But I have no serious problem.\n\n\"I was talking to Governor Shapiro, who's a friend. We have got to win Pennsylvania, my original home state. He and I are putting together a campaign tour in Pennsylvania. I'm going to be campaigning in other states as well. And I'm going to do whatever Kamala thinks I can do to help most.\"\n\nMr. Biden talked with \"CBS Sunday Morning\" in the president's private residence, in the White House Treaty Room, where historic peace agreements have been signed, beneath a portrait of Ulysses S. Grant, the general-turned-president who labored to restore the Union after the Civil War.\n\nAsked how he wishes history to remember him, President Biden replied, \"That he proved democracy can work. It got us out of a pandemic. It produced the single greatest economic recovery in American history. We're the most powerful economy in the world. We have more to do. And it demonstrated that we can pull the nation together.\n\n\"Look, I've always believed, and I still do, the American people are good and decent, honorable people,\" he said. \"When I announced my candidacy to run way back for President, I said, 'We've got to do three things: Restore the soul of America; build the economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down; and bring the country together.' No one thought we could get done \u2013 including some of my own people \u2013 what we got done.\n\n\"One of the problems is, I knew all the things we did were going to take a little time to work their way through,\" he continued. \"So now, people are realizing, 'Oh, that highway, oh, that \u2026' The biggest mistake we made, we didn't put up signs saying, 'Joe did it'!\"\n\nFour years ago, what \"Joe\" did was defeat Donald Trump. Now, with Trump attempting to return to the White House, the president is sounding the alarm in a way sitting presidents rarely, if ever, do.\n\n\"The stakes are that high to you?\" asked Costa.\n\n\"I give you my word, I think they're that high,\" Mr. Biden said. \"Mark my words: If he wins this nomination, I mean, excuse me, this election, watch what happens. It's a danger. He's a genuine danger to American security.\n\n\"Look, we're at an inflection point in world history, we really are,\" the president said. \"The decisions we make in the last three, four years, and the next three or four years are going to determine what the next six decades look like. And democracy is the key. And that's why I went down and made that speech in Johnson Center about the Supreme Court. Supreme Court is so out of whack, so out of whack. And so, I proposed that we limit terms to 18 years.\n\n\"There's little regard by the MAGA Republicans for the political institutions,\" he said. \"That's what holds this country together. That's what democracy's about. That's who we are as a nation.\"\n\n\n\nStory produced by Ed Forgotson. Editor: Carol A.

The source \u2014 an AOL email account identified only as \"Robert\" \u2014 passed along what appeared to be a research dossier the campaign had apparently done on the Republican vice presidential nominee, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio. The document was dated Feb. 23, almost five months before Trump selected Vance as his running mate.\n\n\"These documents were obtained illegally\" and \"intended to interfere with the 2024 election and sow chaos throughout our Democratic process,\" Cheung said.\n\nHe pointed to the Microsoft report issued Friday and its conclusions that \"Iranian hackers broke into the account of a 'high ranking official' on the U.S. presidential campaign in June 2024, which coincides with the close timing of President Trump's selection of a vice presidential nominee.\"\n\n\"The Iranians know that President Trump will stop their reign of terror just like he did in his first four years in the White House,\" Cheung said, adding a warning that \"any media or news outlet reprinting documents or internal communications are doing the bidding of America's enemies and doing exactly what they want.\"\n\nIn response to Microsoft's report, Iran's United Nations mission denied it had plans to interfere or launch cyberattacks in the U.S. presidential election. In July, U.S. officials with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, FBI and Department of Homeland Security indicated that Iran has started an influence campaign designed to undercut Trump's candidacy.\n\nCheung did not immediately respond to questions about the campaign's interactions with Microsoft on the matter.\n\nIn that report, Microsoft stated that \"foreign malign influence concerning the 2024 US election started off slowly but has steadily picked up pace over the last six months due initially to Russian operations, but more recently from Iranian activity.\"\n\nThe analysis continued: \"Iranian cyber-enabled influence operations have been a consistent feature of at least the last three U.S. election cycles. Iran's operations have been notable and distinguishable from Russian campaigns for appearing later in the election season and employing cyberattacks more geared toward election conduct than swaying voters.\"\n\n\"Recent activity suggests the Iranian regime \u2014 along with the Kremlin \u2014 may be equally engaged in election 2024,\" Microsoft concluded.\n\nSpecifically, the report detailed that in June 2024, an Iranian military intelligence unit, Mint Sandstorm, sent a phishing email to an American presidential campaign via the compromised account of a former adviser.\n\n\"The phishing email contained a fake forward with a hyperlink that directs traffic through an actor-controlled domain before redirecting to the listed domain,\" the report states.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris' campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the reported hacking or on the Democratic nominee's cybersecurity protocols.\n\nand contributed to this report.",

        "text": "'No tax on tips' becomes campaign issue for Trump and Harris\nWhy Trump and Harris both say 'no tax on tips'\n\nGetty Images Bartender Athena Young cleans glasses while speaking to the Review-Journal about the \"no tax on tips\" policy at Atomic Kitchen in Las Vegas, July 31.\n\nIn the hotly divided US presidential campaign, a rare area of agreement has emerged: Workers\u2019 tips should not be taxed. Former president Donald Trump, the Republican candidate, was first out of the gate with the proposal, announcing it at a rally in June. Vice-president Kamala Harris, the Democratic opponent, came out in favour of the plan this weekend, earning her the nickname \u201cCopy Cat Kamala\u201d from the Trump campaign. It is a proposal intended to win attention for the candidates from Americans who work in service industries \u2013 restaurant workers, bartenders, hairdressers, manicurists, taxi drivers and others, who often receive a significant portion of their income in tips.\n\nWhere does this matter and why?\n\nBoth candidates announced their support for the idea in Nevada, a state seen as a toss-up in the election. Restaurants and hotels employ more than 20% of the workforce in the state, which is known for its Las Vegas casinos. Mr Trump said he started to champion the policy after a waitress complained to him about her taxes. Republicans, who have long favoured lower taxes, adopted it as part of their official party platform and several bills are now circulating in Congress, backed by restaurant lobby groups. Some Democrats also have voiced support - including President Joe Biden, whose press secretary said that he backed the idea a day after Ms Harris endorsed the plan. The discussion comes as electronic payments make tips easier to trace, raising the risk of failing to report or under-reporting such income, an historically common problem. For all the buzz that ending taxes on tips has generated, however, it is a relatively niche issue. Nationally, an estimated 4 million workers regularly receive tips \u2013 less than 3% of the overall workforce, according to an analysis by Yale University's Budget Lab. What\u2019s more, a significant share of those workers \u2013 about 37% - earn so little that they do not currently pay income taxes to the federal government at all, the analysis found.\n\nWhat are the current rules?\n\nUnder the current law, employees are required to disclose all tips over $20 per month to their employer. The federal government then collects a share via income and payroll taxes, which fund programmes such as Social Security. (States also have their own rules about income tax.) Americans reported $38bn in tip income to the federal government in fiscal year 2018, the most recent year for which there is data. On average, that amounted to just over $6,000 in income per taxpayer. For some servers, however, tips can account for more than half of their hourly earnings, according to estimates from the National Employment Law Project.\n\nWhat impact would this have?",

        "text": "Suspected Iranian cyber intrusion in U.S. presidential race\nDetails emerged over the weekend of a suspected Iranian cyber intrusion into the campaign of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, potentially resulting in the theft of internal campaign documents.\n\nThe FBI is investigating the matter as well as attempts to infiltrate President Joe Biden\u2019s reelection campaign, which became Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 campaign after Biden dropped out of the race.\n\nHere\u2019s what we know:\n\nWhat happened?\n\nTrump\u2019s presidential campaign said Saturday that it had been hacked and that sensitive internal documents were stolen and distributed. It declared that Iranian actors were to blame.\n\nThe same day, Politico revealed it had received leaked internal Trump campaign documents by email, from a person only identified as \u201cRobert.\u201d The outlet said the documents included vetting materials on Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance and Sen. Marco Rubio, who also was considered as a potential vice president.\n\nTwo other news outlets, The New York Times and The Washington Post, also said they received leaked materials. None of them revealed details about what they had, instead describing the documents in broad terms.\n\nIt\u2019s still unclear whether the materials the news outlets received were related to Trump\u2019s alleged campaign hack. Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung indicated they were connected, saying the documents \u201cwere obtained illegally\u201d and warning that \u201cany media or news outlet reprinting documents or internal communications are doing the bidding of America\u2019s enemies and doing exactly what they want.\u201d\n\nThe FBI on Monday confirmed that it\u2019s investigating the intrusion of the Trump campaign. Two people familiar with the matter said the FBI also is investigating attempts to gain access to the Biden-Harris campaign.\n\nWhy is Trump blaming Iran?\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t provide specific evidence showing Iran was behind the hack. But it pointed to a Microsoft report released Friday that detailed an Iranian attempt to infiltrate a presidential campaign in June.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s report said an Iranian military intelligence unit had sent \u201ca spear-phishing email to a high-ranking official of a presidential campaign from a compromised email account of a former senior advisor.\u201d Spear-phishing is a form of cyberattack in which an attacker poses as a known or trusted sender, often to install malware or gather sensitive information.\n\nThe tech company wouldn\u2019t disclose which campaign or adviser was targeted, but said it had notified them. Since then, both Trump and a longtime friend and adviser of the former president, Roger Stone, have said they were contacted by Microsoft related to suspected cyber intrusions.\n\n\u201cWe were just informed by Microsoft Corporation that one of our many websites was hacked by the Iranian Government \u2013 Never a nice thing to do!\u201d Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Saturday.\n\nGrant Smith, an attorney for Stone, said his client \u201cwas contacted by Microsoft and the FBI regarding this matter and continues to cooperate with these organizations.\u201d He declined further comment.\n\nWhat does the government say?\n\nU.S. State Department officials declined to speculate on allegations that Iran was behind the hack, but a spokesperson said it would be in keeping with Tehran\u2019s past use of cyberattacks and deception.\n\n\u201cThese latest attempts to interfere in U.S. elections are nothing new for the Iranian regime,\u201d spokesperson Vedant Patel said on Monday.\n\nU.S. intelligence officials declined to comment on the incident and referred questions to the FBI, which has said only that it\u2019s investigating.\n\nIran\u2019s mission to the United Nations, when asked about the claim of the Trump campaign, denied being involved.\n\n\u201cWe do not accord any credence to such reports,\u201d the mission told The Associated Press. \u201cThe Iranian government neither possesses nor harbors any intent or motive to interfere in the United States presidential election.\u201d\n\nHowever, Iran long has been suspected of running hacking campaigns targeting its enemies in the Middle East and beyond. Tehran also has threatened to retaliate against Trump over the 2020 drone strike he ordered that killed prominent Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani.\n\nWas Harris targeted too?\n\nHarris\u2019 campaign has declined to say whether it has identified any state-based intrusion attempts, only saying it vigilantly monitors cyber threats and wasn\u2019t aware of any security breaches of its systems.\n\nBut two people familiar with the matter said the Biden-Harris campaign also was targeted in the suspected Iranian cyber intrusion. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the details of the investigation.\n\nAt least three staffers in the Biden-Harris campaign were targeted with phishing emails, but investigators have uncovered no evidence the attempt was successful, one of the people said. The attempts came before Biden dropped out of the race.\n\nThe FBI began investigating that cyber incident in June, and intelligence officials believe Iran was behind the attempts, that person said.",

        "text": "Trump campaign says its internal messages hacked by Iran\nTrump campaign says its internal messages hacked by Iran\n\nPolitico said it had confirmed the authenticity of the documents. The BBC has not independently verified the claims.\n\nA Trump campaign spokesman told the BBC the documents were illegally obtained by \"foreign sources hostile to the United States\". In a statement to US media, Iranian officials denied any connection to the hack.\n\nUS news website Politico reported on Saturday that it had been emailed campaign documents including internal research carried out on Trump\u2019s running mate, Ohio Senator JD Vance.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s campaign has said some of its internal communications have been hacked and suggested it was targeted by Iranian operatives.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not give any further details or any evidence linking the document leak to Iranian hackers or the Iranian government.\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said on Monday that it is investigating the incident.\n\nThe Trump campaign statement came one day after Microsoft released a report indicating that Iranian hackers targeted the campaign of an unnamed US presidential candidate in June.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Threat Analysis Center (MTAC) said that the campaign was sent a spear phishing email \u2013 a message designed to look trustworthy in order to get the target to click on a malicious link.\n\n\u201cOver the past several months, we have seen the emergence of significant influence activity by Iranian actors,\u201d the MTAC report said.\n\nTrump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said the June hacking attempt mentioned in the MTAC report \u201ccoincides with the close timing of President Trump\u2019s selection of a vice presidential nominee\".\n\n\u201cThe Iranians know that President Trump will stop their reign of terror just like he did in his first four years in the White House,\u201d Mr Cheung said.\n\nHe said the hack was \"intended to interfere with the 2024 election\".\n\nA spokesman for Iran\u2019s permanent mission to the United Nations said in a statement to the Washington Post: \u201cWe do not accord any credence to such reports.\n\n\"The Iranian Government neither possesses nor harbors any intent or motive to interfere in the United States presidential election.\"\n\nPolitico said that in late July it began receiving emails from a person who identified themselves only as \u201cRobert\u201d using an AOL email account.\n\nThe news outlet said the Vance file was 271 pages long and based on publicly available information about Vance\u2019s past record and statements. The email account also sent part of a research document about Florida Senator Marco Rubio, who was also a vice presidential contender, it said.\n\nPresidential campaigns routinely research potential vice-presidential nominees in order to ferret out any potentially embarrassing revelations. Politico reported that some of Mr Vance's previous - and well-known - criticisms of Trump were labelled in the document as \"potential vulnerabilities\".\n\nThe Microsoft report noted: \"Iranian cyber-enabled influence operations have been a consistent feature of at least the last three US election cycles.\"\n\nMicrosoft had released a similar report during the 2020 election saying Iranian hackers had targeted presidential campaigns.\n\nUS security sources have also warned of an Iranian plot to assassinate Trump, unconnected to last month\u2019s attempted shooting in Pennsylvania. And on Tuesday, the US justice department charged a Pakistani man alleged to have ties to Iran with plotting to assassinate US officials, potentially including the former president.",

Four of the seven charges Peters was found guilty on are felonies.\n\nThe former county clerk was convicted of three counts of attempting to influence a public servant, one count of conspiracy to commit criminal impersonation, first-degree official misconduct, violation of duty and failing to comply with the secretary of state.\n\nProsecutors say Peters engaged in \"a deceptive scheme which was designed to influence public servants, breach security protocols, exceed permissible access to voting equipment and set in motion the eventual distribution of confidential information to unauthorized people,\" according to the indictment.\n\nProsecutors said Peters helped breach the county's election computer systems and allowed an unauthorized individual to access voting equipment and election records. The person posted secure election equipment images online.\n\nPeters became \"fixated\" on voting problems after the 2020 presidential election that some falsely believe was rigged against Trump, prosecutors said.\n\nInvestigators also issued a search warrant for MyPillow founder Mike Lindell, a proponant of election fraud claims, in connection to Peters' case, BBC's American partner CBS News reported.\n\nPeters is set to be sentenced on 3 October. Her attorney could not be reached for comment.",

These voters must attend a state convention held in support of the party or candidate. Conventions may only be during a specific period, from the first Saturday in May to the last Saturday in July. Appeal of any qualification must be filed with the Thurston County Superior Court no later than five days after notification.\n\nBallot order of presidential tickets for the General Election begins with the two major political parties, listed in order of the most votes received in Washington\u2019s last presidential election, under RCW 29A.36.161. Other candidates follow in order of qualification.\n\nMinor party and independent candidates for president will appear on the Nov. 5 General Election ballot as follows, with the Presidential nominee listed first and Vice Presidential nominee listed second:\n\n\n\n\n\nWe The People Party; Robert F.

While ballots themselves won't be available until 30 days before Election Day, Maine law allows voters to request ballots three months before Election Day.\n\n\u201cMaine\u2019s no-excuse absentee voting laws are foundational to our safe, secure and accessible elections,\u201d said Secretary Bellows. \u201cVoting in person on Election Day is always an option, but many busy Mainers find it more convenient to cast an absentee ballot, and those Mainers can put their request in now for the November election.\u201d\n\nVoters may request ballots online at https://apps.web.maine.gov/cgi-bin/online/AbsenteeBallot/index.pl or by contacting their town or city clerk. Contact information for municipal clerks is available at: https://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/elec/munic.html.\n\nBallots will be issued to voters who have requested them in October as absentee ballots are made available 30 days prior to Election Day.\n\nMaine\u2019s no-excuse absentee voting period, including in-person absentee voting at town and city halls, continues through Thursday, Oct. 31.\n\nMaine voters need only to submit one request to receive their absentee ballot, once ballots are available.\n\n\u201cUtilizing the online absentee ballot request tool is a easy and secure way for busy Mainers to request an absentee ballot,\u201d said Deputy Secretary of State Julie Flynn. \u201cTheir town or city clerk will receive the request, and issue the absentee ballot when it is available in early October.\u201d\n\nOnce a ballot request is submitted, Maine voters can track the process of that request and their ballot at: https://apps.web.maine.gov/cgi-bin/online/AbsenteeBallot/ballot_status.pl. Voters who need a replacement ballot should contact their municipal clerk.\n\nAll absentee ballots must be received by a voter\u2019s municipality by 8 p.m. on Election Day.\n\n###",

        "text": "FAU/Mainstreet Poll of Florida Voters on Races and Amendments\nFAU/Mainstreet Poll of Florida Voters on Races and Amendments\n\nFlorida voters weigh in on presidential race and proposed amendments\n\nAs the 2024 U.S. presidential race intensifies, a new poll from the Florida Atlantic University Political Communication and Public Opinion Research Lab (PolCom Lab) and Mainstreet Research USA reveals the shifting tides of politics in Florida, highlighting significant gender, age and racial divides among likely voters.\n\nTrump Maintains Narrow Lead Over Harris\n\nFormer U.S. President Donald Trump holds a slight edge over U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris among likely Florida voters, with 50% supporting Trump and 47% backing Harris. This close margin suggests Florida\u2019s potential swing state status may return in the upcoming election.\n\n\u201cThe narrowing gap between Trump and Harris is consistent with the tightening we have seen in other states,\u201d said Kevin Wagner, Ph.D., professor of political science and co-director of the PolCom Lab. \u201cIf this trend holds, we may see a competitive race in Florida.\u201d\n\nGender, Age and Race Continue to Influence Voting Patterns\n\nFemale voters in Florida favor Harris by 53%, while Trump garners 43%. Among male voters, Trump leads with 56% compared to Harris\u2019 at 39%. Harris leads among voters aged 18-49 with 50%, while Trump is favored by those aged 50 and over with 53%. Harris receives strong support from Black voters at 77%, while Trump captures 17%. The Hispanic vote is evenly split at 49% for both candidates.\n\nSince the PolCom Lab/Mainstreet USA poll of Florida voters in April, Harris has reduced the gap between Democratic and Republican presidential candidates among voters in Florida from an 8% deficit to just 3%. In April, U.S. President Joe Biden trailed Trump by 8% among likely voters. This trend offers the Democratic Party hope of catching up with Trump in the remaining campaign period. However, Trump\u2019s support has remained stable since April, indicating that Harris\u2019 gains are primarily from strengthening support within traditional Democratic bases, such as women, Black voters, younger voters, and Democratic Party loyalists.\n\n\u201cKamala Harris restores the traditional base of the Democratic Party, which includes women, minorities, younger voters, and Democratic Party identifiers,\u201d said Dukhong Kim, Ph.D., associate professor of political science at FAU. \u201cWhile Donald Trump maintains his own established base.\u201d\n\nEarly returns in Florida suggest that voters liked the choice of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz for possible U.S. vice president. Among poll respondents, 44% approve with 34% having a more negative view. About one-quarter of voters do not have a specific opinion on Walz. This suggests he has room to improve his name recognition among voters.\n\n\u201cSo far, Tim Walz has been a help to Harris, but it\u2019s early and many voters are still learning about the Minnesota governor,\u201d said Wagner.\n\nFloridians\u2019 Opinions on the Proposed Amendments\n\nAbortion amendment: 56% of voters support an amendment ensuring no law shall prohibit abortion before viability, with the highest support from Hispanics at 66%. For males, 54% were in support of the abortion amendment compared to 59% of women, and 62% of 18- to 49-year-olds are in support. For Democrats, 80% are in support compared to 35% of Republicans, while 59% of Independents are in support.\n\nMarijuana legalization: 56% of all voters support legalization with younger voters (18-49)\n\nshowing the highest support at 69%, while only 47% of voters over 50 are in support of the amendment. For males and females, 56% support the amendment, while 74% of Democrats are in support compared to 37% of Republicans and 63% of Independents. For blacks, 57.9% are in support, and both white college-educated and white non-college-educated voters support the proposed amendment at roughly 56%. Hispanics were the largest group in opposition with 35.4% saying they would not support Amendment 3.\n\n\u201cThese results reflect a growing awareness of the constitutional amendments. In April, FAU polled on both initiatives and at that time these measures had 49% approval, which shows a gain of 7% over the last four months,\u201d said Luzmarina Garcia Ph.D., assistant professor of political science at FAU. \u201cFor these ballot initiatives to become a constitutional amendment in Florida\u2019s Constitution, 60% of voters need to agree since the rules for a constitutional amendment were changed by the Florida legislature in 2006.\u201d\n\nAmong all voters, 23% of respondents are not sure how they will vote for the abortion amendment, while 15% are unsure how they will vote with the marijuana amendment.\n\n\u201cThere is some evidence of greater turnout in elections when people can vote on more emotionally charged issues, including same-sex marriage and more recently abortion. However, this has primarily been in midterm elections when there is no election for president. With this being a presidential year, many of the people who would turn out to vote on one of these ballot initiatives would probably turnout anyway to vote for a president,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cThese voters that don\u2019t know how they would vote if faced with the ballot initiative could go either way come November.\u201d\n\nSenate Race and Additional Findings\n\nU.S. Senate race: Republican U.S. Sen. Rick Scott leads Democratic candidate Debbie Mucarsel-Powell 47% to 43% among likely voters.\n\n\u201cWhile Scott leads, there is increasing evidence that this race could be competitive in November,\u201d Wagner said.\n\nHeat and water breaks: An overwhelming majority of Florida voters, 85%, agree that cities and counties should have the authority to mandate heat and water breaks for outdoor workers. This sentiment is particularly strong among women, with 88% in favor, compared to 79% of men. Support is more pronounced among Democrats, with 95% backing the measure compared to 75% of Republicans.\n\n\u201cGov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill that prohibited Florida municipalities from requiring heat and water breaks for outdoor workers, preempting a recently enacted regulation in Miami-Dade County,\u201d said Aaron Veenstra, Ph.D., associate professor of journalism at FAU. \u201cThe state\u2019s preemption bill received little coverage at the time it was passed and signed, which may partially explain how something so unpopular with Florida voters across the political spectrum became law. Federal regulators are now looking at requiring heat and water breaks across the country, which has brought attention to the issue at the national level.\u201d\n\nHigh cost of living and school timing opinions: 38% of voters attribute the high cost of living to the federal government, while 29% blame the state government. As schools reopen, 41% of voters believe that the school start time is appropriate, though 31% wish school started later.\n\nNews consumption: 49% of voters listen to news radio at least four days a week, with older voters more likely to tune in daily.\n\n\u201cTalk radio remains a significant source of information for many voters, especially those with early morning and late afternoon commutes,\u201d said Veenstra. \u201cIts format often combines reporting and commentary, offering listeners both a chance to find out about issues and to find out how people like them think about issues. Local radio especially contributes to the sense of what people around us are thinking and thinking about, and often flies under the radar compared with newspapers, TV, and social media.\u201d\n\nThe poll was conducted from Aug. 10 to 11, sampling 1,055 registered Florida voters aged 18 and older. The survey was administered in both Spanish and English using Interactive Voice Response (IVR) and an online panel, ensuring a representative sample of the state\u2019s voting population. While a specific margin of error cannot be assigned due to the online component, a poll of this size typically has a margin of error of +/- 3% at the 95% confidence level, with higher margins for subsamples. This survey provides a snapshot of the Florida voting patterns at this point in time. For full methodologies, visit www.faupolling.com/about/.

        "text": "Campaign cash: Will corporate America decide US election? \u2013 DW \u2013 08\nIn the US, election campaigns cost billions of dollars. The money comes mainly from billionaires and business leaders hoping to gain influence. Will the candidate who raises the most money win?\n\nThere is most probably no other political office in the world that requires so deep a pocket to win than that of the president of the United States. During their 2020 campaigns, then incumbent President Donald Trump and his challenger, Joe Biden, spent a combined $5.7 billion (\u20ac5.2 billion) to win over the hearts and minds of voters \u2014 a new record for a US presidential election, according to OpenSecrets, a US nonprofit which tracks and monitors campaign finance and lobbying.\n\nThis year's presidential campaigns are seemingly running just as smoothly when it comes to funds, with the war chest of Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party's candidate, bulging from the $310 million she reportedly received in donations in July alone.\n\nIn the same month, Republican Party candidate and former US President Donald Trump claimed to have received about $138 million in contributions, news agency Reuters reported.\n\nThe huge sums are raised not only through donations from countless small donors, but mainly from the superrich and corporate America.\n\nMoney makes US politics\n\nIt's no secret that those donating to fundraising campaigns often hope to foster their own goals with their contributions.\n\nLinkedIn co-founder and Microsoft board member Reid Hoffman, for example, made a $7 million contribution to the Democratic campaign, telling television news channel CNN later that he isn't happy with the head of the US Federal Trade Commission, Lina Khan, who was \"waging war on American business.\" He openly expressed his hope that Harris would \"replace\" her.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has also received political and financial backing from big donors, including Timothy Mellon, scion of the Pittsburgh banking family, who has put $50 million behind Trump. Tech investor David Sacks and Tesla CEO Elon Musk are also backing Trump.\n\nClose allies of Musk have formed a so-called super PAC to support Trump, which is expected to pump millions of dollars into Trump's reelection campaign. No Musk donations to the group have yet been disclosed to the Federal Election Commission, but those close to the billionaire have said he is expected to financially support the effort.\n\nThe so-called super Political Action Committees (super PACs) are independent political organizations to which donors can give unlimited amounts of money, while donations to individuals or non-super PACs are capped.\n\nDuring a live chat with Elon Musk on his social media platform X on Monday, August 12, Trump signaled his willingness to offer the Tesla CEO a role in his administration in a proposed so-called government efficiency commission. \"I think it would be great to just have a government efficiency commission that takes a look at these things and just ensures that taxpayer money... is spent in a good way,\" said Musk. \"I'd be happy to help out on such a commission.\"\n\nSupreme Court ruling opened donation spigots\n\nIn 2010, the US Supreme Court issued a ruling that's become a landmark in campaign-funding jurisdiction. J\u00f6rg Hebenstreit, an expert on US domestic politics and campaign finance at the University of Jena in Germany, described it as a turning point in US politics.\n\nThe court ruled that \"corporations may enjoy the same rights as natural persons,\" meaning that any restriction on political campaign financing is ultimately censorship, which is illegal. \"Since 2010, you can basically raise as much money as you want, whether you're a corporation, a bank, a union, an interest group, or a wealthy individual,\" Hebenstreit told DW.\n\nHowever, there are restrictions on direct donations. Currently, an individual can donate a maximum of $6,600 directly to candidates and their teams in the primary and general elections. In addition, there is the option to support a preferred candidate through PACs. Most PACs represent businesses, unions or interest groups and collect donations from members or employees. Individuals can donate up to $5,000 per year to such PACs. They can also give up to $41,300 per year to national party organizations.\n\nHuge donations came pouring in after Joe Biden made way for Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz Image: Charles Rex Arbogast/AP/dpa/picture alliance\n\nThe super PAC workaround\n\nHowever, those seeking to donate more than the mandated limits can establish super PACs which are essentially independent lobbying groups. The condition is that their advertising must not be directly coordinated with the candidates' campaigns. This condition is officially monitored by the Federal Election Commission. But Hebestreit said that the \"coordination ban\" can be \"circumvented through dozens of loopholes.\"\n\nAccording to OpenSecrets , during the current campaigns for US president, some 2,257 super PACs have already been formed. They've collected a combined $2 billion in donations, of which some $700 million have already been spent.\n\nJames Davis, a US political scientist from the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland, told DW that the sums are \"staggering\" and that analysts have \"never seen anything like this before.\"\n\nDoes campaign money wield influence?\n\nBut Hebestreit pointed out that research had shown that donations \"actually have little effect\" in US presidential campaigns. \"Both candidates are usually well-known, and whether they invest another $100 million ultimately has no impact on the actual election outcome,\" he said.\n\nDavis believes a minimum level of donations is certainly necessary to build a party organization for the campaign, and that it's \"crucial\" to motivate people to actually go to the polls. \"At the end of the day, though, it's important to have a message that resonates with voters,\" he added, pointing to Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign, which raised much more money than her rival Trump, but still didn't help her win.\n\nCould VP Kamala Harris beat Donald Trump in US election? To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nWhat often happens, though, is that big donors are able to secure influence on politics even after the election. \"When someone donates millions it won't be a coincidence if that person eventually receives an invitation to an event where the newly elected president just happens to be present,\" said Davis.\n\nHebestreit added that some donors are even offered Cabinet posts, ambassadorial jobs or other diplomatic positions, which open up doors to the corridors of power in the administration.\n\nMuch despised, but essential in US politics\n\nAccording to an opinion poll conducted by the Washington-based Pew Research Center , seven out of 10 US adults want limits on the amount individuals or organizations can donate to political campaigns. Eight out of 10 respondents believe people who donate money to political campaigns have too much influence on the decisions of Congress members, the independent nonpartisan think tank found.\n\nHowever, Hebenstreit believes there is little chance of curbing these financial flows because a change in the laws would require a political majority in Congress, which is currently lacking. After all, one reason why US campaigns are so expensive is that unlike those in other countries, they cannot rely on public campaign financing, he added.\n\nAdditionally, the entire party apparatus has to be rebuilt for each presidential election, Davis explained. \"You could almost say that a party only comes together on a federal level every four years, which means that this organization has to be rebuilt every four years, in 50 states and in the respective districts,\" he said.\n\nAnd finally, in a media-driven country like the US where most of the big networks are in private hands, running nationwide campaigns costs a lot of money.\n\nThis article was originally written in German.",

That includes targeting China by supporting \u201cTaiwan independence\u201d separatist forces, inciting activities for \u201cXinjiang independence\u201d, \u201cHong Kong independence\u201d and \u201cTibet independence\u201d, and orchestrating subversive and infiltration activities against China\u2019s political security and social stability.\n\nWhat the NED does has grossly violated other countries\u2019 sovereignty, security and development interests, breached international law and basic norms of international relations, and jeopardized world peace and stability, which is despised by people who stand for fairness and justice in the world.\n\nPeace, development, fairness, justice, democracy and freedom are the humanity\u2019s common values. Every country has the right to pursue a development path suited to its national realities and the needs of its people. No country is in a position to lecture others on democracy and human rights, still less using democracy and human rights as excuse to hurt other countries\u2019 interests. Members of the international community need to have exchanges and dialogue on the basis of mutual respect and equality, and work together to contribute to the progress of humanity.\n\nChina News Service: It was reported that Australian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence Richard Marles said on August 12 that Australia has signed a cooperation agreement with the US and the UK on nuclear-powered submarines that will enable the three countries to exchange nuclear-related material and information. What is China\u2019s comment on this?\n\nLin Jian: China noted the reports. AUKUS nuclear-powered submarine cooperation harms efforts to keep the region peaceful and secure. The US, the UK and Australia formed AUKUS to advance cooperation on nuclear-powered submarines and other cutting-edge military technologies. Their moves exacerbate the arms race, undermine the international nuclear non-proliferation regime, incite bloc politics and military confrontation and hurt regional peace and stability. China and relevant countries in the region have expressed more than once serious concerns and firm opposition.\n\nAUKUS nuclear-powered submarine cooperation contravenes the object and purpose of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). The cooperation involves the transfer of nuclear-powered submarine reactors and a large amount of weapons-grade highly enriched uranium from nuclear-weapon states to a non-nuclear-weapon state, which constitutes grave nuclear proliferation risks. IAEA\u2019s existing safeguards system cannot place effective safeguards on that, and major controversy exists on the interpretation and application of relevant safeguards provisions. Many countries have already expressed their concerns during the recent second session of the Preparatory Committee for the Eleventh Review Conference of the Parties to the NPT.\n\nChina calls on the international community to take seriously the impact of AUKUS nuclear-powered submarine cooperation on the authority and effectiveness of the NPT, and its negative effect on the IAEA safeguards regime. The international community needs to continue to advance the intergovernmental process and address the world\u2019s concerns over the legal and technical issues involved in the cooperation through the IAEA, the NPT review process and other platforms. Until the international community reaches consensus on safeguards and other issues, the US, the UK and Australia should not proceed with their nuclear-powered submarine cooperation.\n\nThe Paper: It is reported that recently Shigeru Ishiba, former LDP secretary-general and member of the House of Representatives of Japan, along with other Japanese parliamentarians visited the Taiwan region and met with its leader Lai Ching-te and others. What\u2019s China\u2019s comment?\n\nLin Jian: I noted the report. There is but one China in the world. Taiwan is an inalienable part of China\u2019s territory. We firmly oppose any form of official interaction between the Taiwan region and countries having diplomatic ties with China and have lodged serious protests with the Japanese side.\n\nThe Taiwan question is at the very core of China\u2019s core interests. It bears on the political foundation of China-Japan relations and is a red line that must not be crossed. Japan committed innumerable crimes during its 50 years of colonial rule over Taiwan, and is responsible for the enormous sins witnessed by history against the Chinese people. We call on certain Japanese politicians not to forget the lessons of history and to recognize the fact that there is but one China in the world and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China\u2019s territory. They should adhere to the one-China principle and the spirit of the four political documents between China and Japan, and stop sending wrong signals to the \u201cTaiwan independence\u201d separatists. The DPP authorities\u2019 separatist position for \u201cTaiwan independence\u201d and attempt to achieve that by collaborating with external forces will not get them anywhere.\n\nRIA Novosti: It is reported that former US President, the Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said that he does not rule out the possibility that China would \u201ccatch up, maybe even surpass\u201d the US in terms of nuclear arsenal. In an interview with Elon Musk on the social media platform X, he said: \u201cRussia and us are No.1, and we are sort of tied, and China is far behind, but they are developing at a level that you are not surprised to hear, very fast, they\u2019ll end up catching up, maybe even surpassing.\u201d What\u2019s China\u2019s comment?\n\nLin Jian: We have no comment on campaign rhetoric during the US presidential election. The nuclear arsenal of the US is way bigger than China\u2019s. Let me just note that China follows a policy of \u201cno first use\u201d of nuclear weapons and a nuclear strategy that focuses on self-defense. China always keeps its nuclear strength at the minimum level required by national security, and never engages in arms race with anyone.\n\nCNN: According to space monitoring agencies and the US Space Command, one of China\u2019s Long March 6A rockets, after being launched from the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center on August 6, broke apart in low-Earth orbit last week. Multiple space debris-tracking entities said the breakup created a debris cloud consisting of hundreds of pieces. Can you confirm this and provide the latest monitoring information? What measures is China taking to monitor and deal with the debris? What has China done to prevent similar incidents from happening again in the future? (Similar questions from Bloomberg, DPA and RIA Novosti)\n\nLin Jian: The mission of the rocket was a peaceful use of the outer space consistent with international law and universal practice. China has taken necessary measures and is closely monitoring relevant orbit area and conducting data analysis. As a responsible major country, China attaches great importance to space debris mitigation. In conducting outer space activities, China has taken active efforts to fulfill relevant international obligations and regulate its aerospace activities. We\u2019ve made it a rule to always take space debris mitigation measures after satellites and carrier rockets complete their missions, in order to help protect the environment of the outer space and ensure the long-term sustainability of outer space activities.\n\nAP: Has China had any direct or indirect outreach to Iran over its threatened retaliatory strike for the killing of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran? Has China urged Iran not to strike? If so, why? And has China had any outreach to Hamas or others over the group\u2019s decision not to take part in new cease-fire talks?\n\nLin Jian: China has been calling for international efforts to bring an early end to the conflict in Gaza as soon as possible and prevent further spillover. China plays an active role in easing regional tensions. We support all efforts that contribute to permanent and comprehensive ceasefire in Gaza, and will work with the international community to deescalate the situation and avoid further escalation of the conflict and confrontation.\n\nTV Asahi: Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced that he will not run in Liberal Democratic Party\u2019s leadership vote. What is China\u2019s comment on Prime Minister Kishida\u2019s decision? What\u2019s your comment on him as prime minister over the past three years? How will his stepping down affect China-Japan relations? (Similar questions from Kyodo News, Asahi Shimbun and Yomiuri)\n\nLin Jian: We have noted the announcement. This is Japan\u2019s domestic affair. We have no comment on it. China and Japan are important neighbors. China hopes to work with Japan in the spirit of the four political documents between China and Japan to comprehensively advance the strategic relationship of mutual benefit and work to build a constructive and stable China-Japan relationship fit for the new era.",

        "text": "RFK Jr.'s quest to get on the presidential ballot in all 50 states\nWashington \u2014 Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s team is still aiming to be eligible for 270 electoral votes, the number needed to clinch the presidency, with voters set to begin casting their ballots as early as next month.\n\nKennedy's campaign has been working to get him on the ballot in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, but he has some hurdles to overcome.\n\nKennedy is on the ballot as an independent in a growing number of states \u2014 Alaska, Delaware, Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Washington and West Virginia. He's also on the ballot in California as the nominee of the American Independent Party, and in Hawaii, on his We the People ticket. Combined, those states add up to just over 200 electoral votes.\n\nBut New York is denying Kennedy access to the ballot, based on his residency claim. And he's facing challenges in Pennsylvania, Nevada, Delaware and Georgia, as well as an objection to his candidacy in Illinois.\n\nGetting on the ballot in enough states to secure 270 votes \u2014 just over half the 538 votes in the Electoral College \u2014 is no small feat for a third-party contender. The Kennedy campaign is still pushing, since many states have deadlines this month.\n\nFile: Robert F. Kennedy Jr., during a campaign event in Oakland, California, on Tuesday, March 26, 2024. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nThe Kennedy campaign in April said it's trying to evade legal battles by picking the right time to hand in the petitions, holding onto the signatures until the 11th hour in hopes that the signatures will face fewer challenges.\n\nIn addition to varying state regulations for ballot access and expensive legal battles, Kennedy faces opposition from Democratic groups aiming to undermine third-party campaigns.\n\nEarlier this year, the Democratic National Committee formed a team to challenge third-party and independent presidential candidates. The effort will depend on other groups like Third Way, MoveOn, and a new super PAC, Clear Choice, backed by allies of President Biden.\n\nThe stakes are high and we know this is going to be a close election,\" said DNC spokesperson Matt Corridoni. \"That's why a vote for any third-party candidate is a vote for Donald Trump.\"\n\nThe Kennedy campaign in April said it planned to secure ballot access in all 50 states, dismissing suggestions that Kennedy aims to help former President Donald Trump's bid for the presidency by taking votes from Mr. Biden.\n\n\"Our campaign is a spoiler. I agree with that. It's a spoiler for President Biden and for President Trump,\" Kennedy said when he revealed his running mate, Nicole Shanahan, in March.\n\nIn some states, the time frame for collecting signatures is brief. Others have provisions for signature thresholds to be reached in every county of a state. More than half the states require independent candidates to have a running mate.\n\nCollecting enough signatures isn't difficult in every state. Many only require 1,000 to 5,000 signatures. Louisiana requires no signatures and a $500 fee. Other states have higher thresholds. Texas requires over 113,000 signatures, and Florida requires more than 145,000.\n\nAnd those are the number of valid signatures required. Any third-party candidate needs to overshoot that target in order to make sure they have enough in case some of the signatures are found to be invalid.\n\nThe Kennedy campaign says it's aiming to collect 60% over the signature threshold in each state.\n\n\"We have the field teams, volunteers, legal teams, paid circulators, supporters, and strategists ready to get the job done,\" said campaign press secretary Stefanie Spear. \"We are exceeding all our benchmarks and will be announcing new states each week.\"\n\nBut Bernard Tamas, associate professor at Valdosta State University who studies third parties, said Kennedy should be aiming higher \u2014 closer to double the required number of signatures.\n\n\"I'm surprised they're saying it's as low as 60, you just can't take any chances,\" Tamas told CBS News in April.\n\nCollecting signatures is expensive. Kennedy's super PAC estimates that it will cost around $40 to $50 million just to collect all the necessary signatures, although Tamas noted RFK Jr.'s running mate, Shanahan, the billionaire ex-wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin, has the financial resources.\n\nCollecting the signatures isn't the hardest part \u2014 it's the battle over the signatures that's the real fight, Tamas said. The Democratic Party will be fighting hard to invalidate Kennedy's signatures.\n\n\"You really have to prepare for a battle, so a lot of the cost is not actually getting the signatures, but actually the legal fees of fighting each state,\" Tamas said.\n\nHistorically, there have been independent candidates who secured ballot access across nearly all states. In 1968, George Wallace, the former governor of Alabama, and in 1992, businessman Ross Perot both appeared on the ballot in all 50 states. Ralph Nader's candidacy in 2000 extended to 43 states.\n\nOnly Wallace managed to win any electoral votes. Perot's impressive 19% of the popular vote in 1992 did not translate to any success in the Electoral College.\n\nPerot's former campaign manager, Russell Verney, said third-party candidates must overcome more obstacles today than in the past.\n\n\"Every time there's a reasonably successful independent candidate, the state legislatures, which are made up of Republicans and Democrats, who by definition do not like competition, increase the state barriers to getting on the ballot,\" Verney said in April. \"The requirements to get on these state ballots continues to get more onerous in every election cycle.\"\n\nA successful third-party candidate has to focus on individuals who aren't being represented by the major parties, and that's a problem for Kennedy.\n\n\"He's all over the place, and it's really not clear what's the disaffected group he's trying to tap into,\" said Tamas. \"He's running on conspiracy theories is part of it. But if someone's a conspiracy theorist, chances are they're going to support Donald Trump.\"\n\nKennedy's support is likely to drop off before November, Tamas predicted in April.\n\nBut it's not yet clear whether Mr. Biden or Trump stands to lose more from Kennedy's presidential bid.\n\n\"Nobody really knows for sure who he's going to take votes from,\" Tamas said.",

        "text": "Health Policy and the 2024 Election\n\u201cOver the last 20 years there has been a rise in deaths from opioids, and that really escalated during the pandemic. Now, more than 100,000 people per year die of an overdose,\u201d says Patrick.\n\nAs a result, there\u2019s been broad bipartisan support for ending the crisis, even if people disagree on the methods. \u201cWe've seen multiple pieces of legislation and initiatives that have happened over the last eight years. Everything from the declaration of a national emergency to the SUPPORT Act,\u201d says Patrick.\n\nPatrick would know. He testified at the Senate to help inform the creation of the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities (SUPPORT) Act in 2018. This legislation provided funding for community-based treatment and recovery services, and it also required Medicaid to cover medications for opioid use disorder.\n\nThe Biden-Harris administration has used a very intentional harm reduction approach, explains Patrick. Harm reduction techniques like clean needle programs and the distribution of overdose reversal kits serve people who want to use substances more safely. For example, the Food and Drug Administration made overdose reversal kits available over-the-counter in 2023, albeit at a high sticker price.\n\nHarris has a strong record of action to fight the opioid crisis. As vice president, she met with state attorneys general to discuss federal and state-level action against illicit fentanyl and expanding access to treatment for people at risk of overdose. During her tenure as California attorney general, she filed a lawsuit against pharmaceutical companies to lower the cost of opioid addiction treatment.\n\nOn the other hand, Trump is focused on tackling the issue from the supply side. He plans to declare a \u201cwar\u201d on cartels, designate them as terrorist organizations, and levy military action and embargoes against them. He would collaborate with neighboring governments to destroy the cartels and expose corruption.\n\nPatrick points out that the drug market is complex. Not all drugs come from cartels across the border, and some even enter the country legally. Plus, drugs like fentanyl can be made synthetically. \u201cIt's not like the days where you had to grow a crop,\u201d he says.\n\nHistorically, the focus on eliminating drug supply has simply led people to switch to other drugs. \u201cThe opioid crisis is a great example of that,\u201d explains Patrick. \u201cWe had a prescription opioid crisis, so then we enacted policies that tried to decrease the supply. And what we saw were higher prices on the street for prescription opioids.\u201d As a result, people turned to heroin, which was cheaper, and then fentanyl, which was even cheaper.\n\n\u201cWe have a long history in the U.S. of fighting a drug war and that was largely ineffective,\u201d Patrick says. What\u2019s more, it villainized people who used substances, especially people of color.\n\n\u201cWe know that public health approaches rather than criminal justice approaches are more effective,\u201d Patrick adds. \u201cThere is no question that we have to do a better job of limiting the supply of illicit fentanyl in the U.S., but that can't be the only solution. We need vast expansion in treatments. We need harm reduction. We need a comprehensive approach that really does have to be grounded in public health.\u201d\n\nStory by Deanna Altomara\n\nDesigned by Linda Dobson\n\nIllustration by John Jay Cabuay",

        "text": "Biden-Harris Administration Issues Memorandum Supporting Improvements to Federal Hiring Experience\nWashington, D.C. - Today, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued a joint memorandum to provide guidance to federal agencies on how to improve the hiring experience for job applicants, managers, and HR professionals.\n\n\u201cWe aim to continuously improve the federal government\u2019s ability to recruit, hire, and retain a diverse and skilled workforce to strengthen the way agencies deliver on their missions for the American people,\u201d said OPM Acting Director Rob Shriver. \u201cThis memorandum builds on that success and is a culmination of years of data-driven and innovative thinking about the federal hiring experience.\u201d\n\n\u201cImproving government hiring is essential to bringing onboard the next generation of leaders who reflect our mission and possess the skills needed to meet mission and serve the public,\u201d said Volcker Alliance President Sara Mogulescu. \u201cI am glad to see OPM and OMB collaborating to ensure that agencies thoroughly integrate this important suite of hiring reforms into their operations and culture.\u201d\n\n\"This memo is a strong step forward in improving the federal hiring experience,\" said Tech Talent Project Co-Founder and Executive Director Jennifer Anastasoff. \"Many tech, data, and AI professionals - and beyond - are eager to serve their country. It's exciting to see the federal government looking to best-in-class recruitment and retention strategies to attract and keep folks who are critical to delivering services, enforcing laws, and protecting our country. This initiative will allow agencies to build the diverse talent pool necessary to meet today's challenges.\"\n\nThe memorandum will provide guidance to federal agencies to:\n\nStrengthen agency\u2019s strategic workforce planning, recruitment, hiring, and data analytics.\n\nImprove the federal applicant experience, including expanding recruitment efforts to bring in diverse skills and experiences, and developing improved application processes that are user-friendly, accessible, and efficient for the public.\n\nProvide hiring managers with tools and training to improve their hiring strategies, processes, and internal customer experience.\n\nEmpower HR professionals with innovative actions and hiring strategies that enable them to recruit, retain, and advance talent to support agency missions, programs and requirements.\n\nTo support federal agencies with the implementation of this memorandum, OPM issued the following Fact Sheets on resources and tools:\n\nAgencies will be asked to track and share progress on improving the hiring experience and present results on the implementation of this memo to the President\u2019s Management Council. Additionally, OPM will be monitoring progress through key Hiring Experience metrics.\n\nThis memo builds upon work OPM has done over the last three years to improve federal agency hiring. For example, OPM has:\n\nHelped agencies successfully hire over 8,000 targeted federal positions in support of Bipartisan Infrastructure Act implementation.\n\nSupplied skills-based assessments, when requested, to agencies in support of quality federal hires, with over 100 available skills and competency-based assessments ready to be used, on-demand.\n\nIssued several rules to improve hiring, including a final rule updating the Pathways Programs to enable more early career talent to join government and to facilitate easier conversion to permanent positions. Interim final rules on the College Graduates Hiring Authority and Post-Secondary Hiring Authority further help agencies built their pipeline of talent for the future; a final rule on the 10-year Term Appointment for Certain STEM Professionals allows agencies to make a 10-year term appointment for certain STEM employees for specific roles; and a Reinstatement final rule gives agencies the discretion to reinstate certain former federal employees noncompetitively at any grade level for which the individual is qualified.\n\n\n\n\n\nMade strategic changes to USAJOBS to support hiring, including a redesigned USAJOBS homepage based on job seeker feedback to improve applicant experience, an improved search functionality, publishing a series of videos on how to apply for federal positions, a new functionality in the USAJOBS Agency Talent Portal allowing federal agencies to view and select candidates more easily; and a new Agency Talent Pools feature to support the sharing of certificates across government.\n\nCreated a new Hiring Experience (HX) Group that is partnering with agency Talent Teams to drive innovative assessment and hiring practices.\n\nUpdated and published 80 occupation-specific general competency models that serve as resources for agencies to leverage in their skills-based hiring practices.\n\nLed cross-government hiring actions in numerous fields including Data Scientist, Budget Analyst, IT Specialist, and Contract Specialist and supported agencies\u2019 increased use of agency shared certificates.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has championed the use of shared certificates to streamline the Government\u2019s hiring process which has helped ensure that it continues to recruit and hire top talent for its mission critical work. \u201cBy using shared certificates, we expedite the hiring process by filling vacancies from the shared certificate of candidates who have already completed rigorous assessments and have been determined qualified,\u201d said HHS Chief Human Capital Officer Bob Leavitt. \u201cSpecifically, we hire as many qualified candidates as possible from every solicitation, which reduces hiring timelines and processes.\u201d Over the past four years, HHS has made over 13,000 hires from shared certificates across the Department. \u201cThe use of shared certificates is an extraordinary opportunity to improve the federal hiring experience by simplifying and streamlining the hiring process,\u201d said Leavitt.\n\nOPM continues to support agencies to help drive federal hiring improvements and innovations through its HX Group. In addition to the tools and resources already in-place to support this work, over the next several months OPM will host a hiring manager symposium and additional trainings and webinars for HR professionals and hiring managers to help reinforce the actions and initiatives outlined in the memo. to help reinforce the actions and initiatives outlined in the memo.",

        "text": "News Bureau\nRobert Bruno is a professor of labor and employment relations at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and the director of the Project for Middle Class Renewal, a research-based initiative tasked with investigating labor policies in today\u2019s economy. Bruno, the author of the book \u201cWhat Work Is,\u201d spoke with News Bureau business and law editor Phil Ciciora about the state of the American worker.\n\nWhat\u2019s the state of labor and the labor movement in 2024?\n\nIt\u2019s a tale of varying perspectives on a different set of numbers, each of which tells a different story.\n\nOn one hand, the national unionization rate in 2023 held steady at 10% of the eligible labor force. However, the country added union members for the second consecutive year. In total, there were 14.5 million union members in 2023. But overall employment has grown faster than total union membership, causing membership rates to fall to their lowest levels in 10 years. On a positive note, the number of unions filing election petitions with the National Labor Relations Board is up and the number of workers organizing is the highest since 2014.\n\nImportantly, workers are organizing in industries traditionally considered difficult to organize and largely written off. Organizing also is now following some of the forces of economic development \u2014 for example, logistics, warehouse, technology, retail, online media, professional services, education. Today, roughly 100,000 of the United Auto Workers\u2019 approximately 400,000 members are university employees. Workers not historically viewed as ripe for organizing are also joining unions. For example, 46% of workers covered by union contracts have a bachelor\u2019s degree or more. And it\u2019s the first time since labor\u2019s \u201cglorious 30 years\u201d of the 1940s-1970s that new labor organizations are being formed.\n\nThe biggest example is the Amazon Labor Union, which has merged with the Teamsters union. These are campaigns spearheaded by workers themselves, with professional labor organizers playing a supportive role.\n\nThe UAW is also actively organizing auto facilities in the South and at current electric vehicle plants, and is positioned to do so as EV assembly plants come online. Success at these employers would represent important growth that would have a ripple effect across the labor market.\n\nThe past year has been a contentious one for labor. Have strikes increased or decreased?\n\nThe total number of work stoppages, approximate number of workers involved in stoppages and strike days have increased each year over the past three years. The reason why? Unions have demonstrated more capacity to use the strike to improve working conditions and wages.\n\nPresident Biden has been labeled the most pro-labor U.S. president ever. Now he\u2019s a lame duck, and former President Trump has made some in-roads with organized labor. How do you explain that?\n\nFirst of all, President Biden has earned the status of most pro-labor president ever. On every measurable indicator, he\u2019s used his office to herald the benefits of collective bargaining and protect and promote the rights of workers to organize beyond what other presidents have ever done. And without question, labor unions have done considerably better during the Biden administration than when Trump was in office.\n\nNonetheless, Trump did attract some white male union worker support in 2016 and 2020, and will likely do so again in the 2024 election. While Trump offers no genuine support for organized labor, decades of bipartisan genuflection to myths about the free market have harmed, angered and disillusioned working class folks. In response, some union and nonunion workers have sought out an avatar to express their feelings of alienation.\n\nThe disenfranchisement that working class voters felt in 2016 also fueled the populism on the left of Sen. Bernie Sanders. Sanders and Trump are radically different in character and politics. Sanders\u2019 critique of the political economic system was informed by an understanding of extreme income and wealth inequality, and the role of racism. Sanders\u2019 prescription was to bring democracy to the marketplace. Trump\u2019s prescription was massive tax cuts for the wealthy and greater extraction of wealth from the bottom to benefit the top. Sanders believed in more democracy inside and outside of the workplace. Trump fashioned himself like a 19th-century robber baron and insisted that workers and citizens simply do what was dictated to them by the corporate elite.\n\nDespite their differences, however, both were able to tap into white middle-class discontent. One post-2016 election report found that 12% of Sanders\u2019 primary voters eventually voted for Trump. Then workers, including 43% of union members, voted in 2016 for Trump, who never delivered any genuine relief to working people. On the contrary, his administration acted against workers\u2019 interests. Despite campaign promises to take on companies that move jobs overseas, two years into his administration, Trump had already awarded over $115 billion in federal contracts to companies that offshored jobs.\n\nHow would labor fare under each of the respective presidential tickets?\n\nOrganized labor and all members of the working class would fare substantially better under a Kamala Harris presidency than another Trump presidency. Harris would maintain the support for bargaining, unionization rights and policies that expand justice for workers that President Biden championed, including paid leave, expanding the child tax credit and signing the Protecting the Right to Organize Act.\n\nHer choice for vice president, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, has supported and signed what\u2019s arguably the most pro-worker state legislation in the country. He promoted a broad pro-worker agenda that included giving workers up to six paid \u201csick and safe\u201d days a year; a $2.6 billion infrastructure bill; a law that creates a statewide \u201cstandards board\u201d to set minimum pay and benefits for nursing homes workers in the state; and much more.\n\nAlternatively, we have the anti-worker agenda of the Trump-Vance ticket, whose labor policies are explicitly laid out in the Heritage Foundation\u2019s \u201cMandate for Leadership: The Conservative Promise, Project 2025.\u201d The section on labor is a blueprint on how to dismantle unions as an effective workplace and political representative of workers.",

        "text": "Trump may surprise us on the Ukraine war\nThe timing of the US presidential election in November and the inauguration of the next US president in January will likely coincide with a lower tempo period in the Ukraine war as both sides hunker down for the winter. This does not mean that the fighting stops, but it does mean that military activity will appear to decline relative to the higher tempo spring and summer months. It is likely neither side will be able to make decisive inroads during this time. While a re-elected Democratic administration may continue its current level of support for Ukraine even if it is unclear who is winning the war, what might a newly elected Trump administration do?\n\nRussia\u2019s stalled momentum\n\nOver the last seven months, Russia has attempted to exploit the failure of the 2023 Ukrainian counter-offensive, the late 2023 civil-military crisis in the Ukrainian government, and the long debate on US aid to Ukraine that deprived the Ukrainians of much needed munitions and equipment in early 2024. The Russian military has been conducting a large-scale offensive campaign on the ground and in the air to pummel the Ukrainian military and to influence the political calculus of Ukraine\u2019s government and its Western supporters.\n\nBut for all its efforts, and the loss of 180,000 troops in that time, Russia has only made minor territorial gains. It has not changed the willingness of the Ukrainian military to fight, or the will of the Ukrainian government to continue its defence against what they view as an existential war being waged upon them.\n\nAs Russia\u2019s current offensives continue but begin to lose momentum, Ukraine has been focused on the reconstitution of its forces in the wake of the 2023 counter-offensive and a long and bitter debate over mobilisation. The Ukrainians, however, have recently shocked the Russians, and their supporters, with a major operation in Russia\u2019s Kursk Oblast.\n\nFour factors will influence the war in 2025\n\nFour things will have a major influence on the war.\n\nThe first is the impact of Russia\u2019s ongoing offensive and whether it will take additional territory before the Russian ground forces culminate. While the prospect of a Russian breakthrough cannot be discounted, Moscow will most likely continue to undertake assaults on multiple axes, which will force Kyiv to commit troops and firepower it would prefer to preserve for the offensives to come.\n\nWhile the Ukrainian Kursk operation is attempting to change the status quo in the war, the biggest impact on the dynamics of the conflict could be a return of Donald Trump to the White House.\n\nA second influence will be the outcome of the ongoing Ukrainian operation inside Russia\u2019s Kursk Oblast. Having already humiliated Putin and the Russian army with their surprise attack last week, Ukraine has multiple options for how it can politically and strategically exploit its successes in this new operation.\n\nA third impact on Ukraine\u2019s 2025 operations will be the winter. Ukrainians have a miserable winter coming because of Russia\u2019s destruction of about 50 per cent of the country\u2019s power-generating capacity needed for the winter months. This will have a political impact on Ukrainians\u2019 view of their government and the war. The winter will also be a time when both the Ukrainian and Russian militaries will be conducting long-range strike operations and making final assessments, plans, and logistic stockpiling for ground operations in the spring.\n\nHowever, while the Ukrainian Kursk operation is attempting to change the status quo in the war, the biggest impact on the dynamics of the conflict could be a return of Donald Trump to the White House.\n\nTrump camp\u2019s views on Ukraine\n\nThere are some indicators about which way a second-term President Trump might lean. Presidential candidate Trump has claimed that he would end the Ukraine war quickly if he were elected. A plan drawn up by two former members of Trump\u2019s National Security Council staff, Keith Kellogg and Fred Fleitz, proposes a ceasefire based on current frontlines on the battlefield, however this is not known to have been endorsed by Trump.\n\nVice-Presidential candidate JD Vance has been very open about his views on Ukraine. After Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, Vance stated that \u201cI don\u2019t really care what happens to Ukraine one way or another.\u201d And, in a New York Times opinion piece in April 2024, Vance wrote that \u201cUkraine\u2019s challenge is not the GOP; it\u2019s math. Ukraine needs more soldiers than it can field, even with draconian conscription policies. And it needs more mat\u00e9riel than the United States can provide. This reality must inform any future Ukraine policy.\u201d\n\nNotwithstanding the apparently cordial Zelensky\u2013Trump phone call in the wake of the Republican National Convention, a Trump administration will be difficult to navigate for the Ukrainians. In the most recent Pew Research Center survey, published in May, less than half of Republican Party voters have a favourable view of NATO compared to 75 per cent of Democratic Party voters. Nearly half (49%) of Republican voters believe the United States is giving too much aid to Ukraine.\n\nIf these sentiments are taken together with Trump\u2019s role in encouraging a four-month interruption in US assistance to Ukraine in 2023, his assertions that he would let Russia \u201cdo whatever the hell they want\u201d to NATO countries that did not spend enough, and his recent comments about Taiwan not paying America enough to guarantee its defence, a picture begins to form about how a US administration under Trump might approach the world. But it remains an opaque view at best.\n\nQuick solutions will prove elusive\n\nShould Trump not be able to achieve a quick solution in the Ukraine war, he could well turn on Putin and increase US support to Ukraine.\n\nThe Russians have previously stated that any peace plan proposed by a Trump administration would have to reflect the reality on the ground in Ukraine, but that Putin remains open to talks. To this must now be added the reality on the ground in Kursk. However, should Trump not be able to achieve a quick solution in the Ukraine war, he could well turn on Putin and increase US support to Ukraine.\n\nThere is much that might happen to impact voter intentions between now and the November election. But one thing is certain. The Ukrainians understand what is at stake if they lose Russia\u2019s war of aggression. Even if a Trump administration attempts to force them into an unsustainable armistice, Ukraine would likely choose to fight on without US support. That is still a better option than subjecting themselves to what is likely to be only a short-term reprieve from ongoing Russian predation.",

Tim Walz as her running mate\u2014after President Joe Biden made the unprecedented decision to drop out of the race, only a week after former President Donald Trump survived an assassination attempt.\n\nNow, Democrats will gather in Chicago from Aug. 19-22, setting the stage for the final months of the election. Chicago has hosted the DNC several times, but the 1968 convention often sticks in popular and historical memory. Earlier that year, President Lyndon B. Johnson announced he would not seek reelection, requiring delegates to vote for a new nominee. Outside the convention, thousands of police and anti-Vietnam War protestors clashed violently, all televised for the world to see.\n\nWe spoke to Profs. Elisabeth Clemens, John Mark Hansen and William Howell, leading University of Chicago scholars, to get their thoughts on the significance of this political moment, comparisons to the 1968 convention and the issues that will shape the remainder of the election.\n\nA lot has happened in the past few weeks. From your scholarly perspective, how are you thinking about this unique political moment?\n\nClemens: After years of focus on democratic erosion, the past few months have unsettled any confidence in predictions. The election results in India, for the European parliament, in France, in Britain, or in Venezuela provide evidence of both deep vulnerabilities and unexpected possibilities for democratic politics. In this context, I will watch for how the U.S. candidates are\u2014or are not\u2014able to persuade voters that it is worth voting.\n\nHowell: Historically, there have been instances when an incumbent president withdrew during an election year, as in 1968. There have been previous assassination attempts on presidents, former presidents and candidates. There have been plenty of elections when uncertainty about a party\u2019s nomination ran right through a brokered convention.\n\nWhat we've been observing over the course of the last month is altogether exceptional: An incumbent president who secured all the delegates needed for the nomination but who withdrew from the campaign just weeks before the convention for reasons that have nothing to do with a political scandal or with a falling out with his party on the basis of policy issues\u2014and a vice president emerging within hours as the new candidate. On split screen, meanwhile, you have Trump not just wielding, but flaunting his total control over the Republican Party, which was only enhanced through this recent assassination attempt; and then him selecting, if not a facsimile, then certainly a loyal servant as his vice president.\n\nAll of this has happened in a matter of weeks. Have we seen some of the elements of this drama before? Sure. Have we seen them strung together in the way that we have this last month? Not even close.\n\nHansen: In my election analysis, I tend to emphasize the \u201cfundamentals\u201d\u2014partisanship, state of the economy, war and peace, positioning on issues\u2014over the particulars of the candidates. The fundamentals work because they prioritize historical experience and discount idiosyncrasies. But we\u2019ve never had so many idiosyncrasies.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult not to compare this DNC to the one held in Chicago in 1968. What are a few key parallels and differences between them?\n\nHansen: Some people seem to fixate on the comparison out of hope and some out of fear, but I don\u2019t think the parallels are so great. In 1968, two national leaders were assassinated (King and Kennedy), there were riots in cities large and small (including Chicago), U.S. soldiers were fighting in Vietnam, and the movement against the war was vastly larger than anything we\u2019ve seen this year. Chicago was controlled by a machine. The Democratic Party was deeply split over the war, and George Wallace was running an independent campaign to reverse the progress in civil rights. There are deep social cleavages now, but they are between the parties rather than within the parties.\n\nHowell: After Biden stepped down, there was a brief moment where we might have seen something like the \u201868 convention\u2014if a stalwart of the liberal wing of the Democratic Party had stepped forward to contest Harris, and if a divided party had sought to reconcile its differences in a brokered convention. But that moment vanished almost instantly. The party fell in line behind Harris. And despite lingering cleavages\u2014particularly over the war in Gaza\u2014the party appears entirely unified in its support for Harris.\n\nMoreover, this convention is coming on the heels of a sustained period of social, racial and political tumult, as occurred in \u201868. And let us also note that Chicago's mayor today looks very different from the Mayor Daley from \u201868. It\u2019s inconceivable that Mayor Johnson will encourage the police force to crack down on protesters, as Daley did. On the whole, then, it\u2019s hard to see how this year\u2019s convention looks anything like the division, upheaval and violence that defined the one in 1968.",

        "text": "US election 2024: how Trump and Vance are trying to weaponise Kamala Harris\u2019s multiracial identity\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black and now, she wants to be known as Black.\u201d\n\nThis was what former president and current Republican party presidential candidate Donald Trump told the National Association of Black Journalists convention on July 31. It was a revealing insight into how he viewed his rival Kamala Harris\u2019s multiracial identity.\n\nDuring a heated exchange, Trump wrongly claimed that Harris, a woman of Black and South Asian heritage, had shifted her racial identity over the course of her career. Trump\u2019s vice-presidential candidate, JD Vance, subsequently doubled down in support of his boss, using language such as \u201cchameleon\u201d and \u201cflip flopping\u201d to describe Harris\u2019s politics and identity.\n\nThese comments were inherently disrespectful, as no one has the right to dictate another person\u2019s racial identity. But the Trump-Vance ticket has tried to use Harris\u2019s multiracial identity as a political tool to foster distrust in her among the American population.\n\nMultiracial racism in America\n\nSo, why was Trump and Vance\u2019s language so harmful? Despite being one of the most racially diverse countries in the world, the US has played a significant role in the perpetuation of racism.\n\nThe early 20th century introduced the \u201cone drop rule\u201d to America, which codified racism into law in some US states. It asserted that any person with even one Black ancestor was considered racially Black, regarding multiracial Americans with white ancestry \u201cimpure\u201d and viewed them as contaminated.\n\nThis was a political effort to maintain power over enslaved Black populations, as \u201cracial mixing\u201d blurred the lines between who could be considered free, and who was not.\n\nPrior to 1967 and the landmark Loving v Virginia judgment, which which ruled that laws banning interracial marriage were unconstitutional, almost half of the states enforced anti-miscegination laws that made interracial relations illegal, directed at Black-White unions but extended to ethnic groups. Therefore, mixed-race identities were discriminated against based on physical appearance, affecting their access to segregated residential areas and other social spaces.\n\nOne byproduct of this hateful racial theory was that mixed-race people, particularly women, became mythologised as deceitful and cunning tricksters. Historical and current white ruling classes feared multiracial people were somehow \u201cshape shifters\u201d, who accessed segregated white spaces and resources. Today, this appears in the way racial categories are imposed into which mixed-race people simply do not fit.\n\nWhile mixedness is no longer considered a contamination, lingering beliefs in racial stratification can provoke uncomfortable emotions towards mixed-race identities, whose physical appearances do not match racist stereotypes about different ethnic groups.\n\nThis all makes Trump and Vance\u2019s comments that much worse.\n\nContinues\u2026\n\nFor the full article written by Rhianna Garrett visit the Conversation.\n\nENDS",

        "text": "Harris and Biden make first joint appearance since ticket change\nHarris will be 'one hell of a president', says Biden\n\nBiden praises Harris in first joint public appearance\n\nVice-President Kamala Harris and President Joe Biden have appeared at an event together for the first time since the president ended his run for a second term and Ms Harris replaced him as the Democratic nominee. The event, held just outside Washington DC, came as Donald Trump spoke at a news conference in New Jersey - his second campaign event in the past two days. The Democratic event on Thursday celebrated the Biden administration's newly announced deal to cut the cost of 10 common prescription drugs for millions of Americans. It also offered a glimpse of the pair's dynamic, weeks into a realignment of the party ticket.\n\nThe White House said some 2,300 people attended Thursday's rally in Upper Marlboro, Maryland - a Democratic stronghold. \u201cI have an incredible partner in the progress we made,\" the president said. \"She going to make one hell of a president.\" But more than the policy announcement, Mr Biden boosted his vice-president. He brought the crowd to their feet multiple times. The warm feelings were mutual. \"There's a lot of love in this room for our president,\" Ms Harris said. \"Few leaders in our nation have done more, on so many issues, including to expand access to affordable healthcare, than Joe Biden.\" US strikes deal to cut cost of 10 drugs for Medicare users\n\nWhat to know: Medicare negotiation lowers drug prices\n\nA different kind of Trump on display\n\nGetty Images\n\nThousands stood in line in the summer heat for the chance to see Mr Biden and Ms Harris speak. Social media video showed hundreds still in line as the venue reached capacity. It's the latest in a series of events Ms Harris has hosted that have drawn large crowds of supporters, marking a noticeable shift in energy in the presidential race. Ms Harris, however, has largely avoided media questions and has yet to sit down for an interview since becoming her party's candidate. Her supporters' enthusiasm is showing up in polling data, too. A recent survey from the Cook Political Report suggests Ms Harris is erasing former President Donald Trump's polling leads in Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Vivian Strong waited three hours to get into Thursday's event. She hoped to be part of a historic moment, she told the BBC. \"I feel a sense of urgency to actually ensure she gets elected,\" she said. \"I would hate to have another administration of the other guy.\" Before the president and vice-president took the stage, some supporters led the crowd in chants from Howard University - the historically black university Ms Harris attended in Washington DC. Many supporters of the vice-president donned pink and green, the colours of the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority (AKA) to which Ms Harris belonged. Linda Jones, a Howard alumna and a member of AKA, said their shared identity excites her. But she was also eager to see Mr Biden speak. \"I'm happy for President Biden to get something accomplished that he's worked so hard for,\" Ms Jones told the BBC, referring to the prescription drug deal. \"He's such a good man and I felt very bad he was leaving with a cloud, so now I feel [this policy] is one more boost for him.\"\n\nGetty Images\n\nMeanwhile, Trump, who spoke from his golf resort in Bedminster, lashed out as Ms Harris over the course of his press conference - his second in as many weeks. He argued that he was \"entitled to personal attacks\" against Ms Harris, and hit on his main campaign themes, attacking her record on inflation, crime and immigration. Trump, flanked by common grocery store items with signs showing cost increases in recent years for each, asked: \"How can a family afford that?\" Inflation in the US rose at the slowest pace in more than three years last month, marking relief for consumers. Inflation has been a top financial concern for many Americans. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to imagine what a Kamala Harris presidency would be like, because you are living through that nightmare right now,\u201d Trump said. \"I don't have a lot of respect for her. I don't have a lot of respect for her intelligence,\" he said, adding: \"People say, 'Oh be nice'. But they're not nice to me. They want to put me in prison.\" Earlier on Thursday, US media reported that the Secret Service would begin using bulletproof glass to protect Trump whenever he is speaking on stage at outdoor campaign events. The measure it typically done for sitting presidents, but an exception is being made in the wake of the attempted assassination of Trump last month in Pennsylvania. The Secret Service declined to comment on the reports.",

Weber, Ph.D., Announces Results of Randomized Alphabet Drawing for the November 5, 2024, General Election\n\n\n\nSacramento, Calif. \u2013 The California Secretary of State held a randomized alphabet drawing today to determine the order that candidates\u2019 names will appear on the November 5, 2024, General Election ballot.\n\nThe results of today\u2019s drawing are as follows:\n\nI F L T D E H Q M J G A Y R P C B V X K U N O W S Z\n\nThis alphabet applies throughout the candidate's name, last name first, followed, if necessary, by first name, then middle name. If more than one candidate's last name begins with the same letter, the alphabet applies to the second letter and, if needed, the third, etc., until different letters appear in the same position. For example, if two candidates with the last names Campbell and Carlson are running for the same office, their order on the ballot will depend on the order in which the letters \"M\" and \"R\" were drawn in the randomized alphabet drawing.\n\nToday\u2019s randomized alphabet drawing was held in the Elections Division of the Secretary of State\u2019s office in compliance with Elections Code section 13112.

        "text": "Ask an expert: Labor and the economy in the 2024 presidential election\nUNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. \u2014 Jobs and the economy are among the most important issues for voters during the 2024 presidential election, with interest rates, the cost of consumer goods and job availability at the tops of people\u2019s minds. Penn State News spoke with Kenneth Louie, associate professor of economics, Penn State Behrend, to learn more about the current state of the U.S. economy and the issues that the presidential candidates will need to address as they continue on the campaign trail.\n\nQ: What is the current status of the U.S. economy, and what actions could strengthen it?\n\nLouie: The U.S. economy is continuing to display remarkable resilience as reflected in three important economic indicators: employment; output, or the quantity of goods and services produced; and earnings.\n\nIn terms of employment, the economy added over 2.5 million jobs in 2023, an average of over 200,000 jobs per month on a seasonally adjusted basis. Job growth has continued throughout the first seven months of 2024, although the pace of that growth has slowed. Throughout 2023 and early 2024, the monthly unemployment rate remained below 4% on a seasonally adjusted basis, increasing only slightly to 4.3% in July.\n\nIn terms of output, the U.S. Gross Domestic Product \u2014 or the total value of goods and services produced, essentially a measure of the size of the country\u2019s economy \u2014 grew by 2.5% in 2023 and 2.8% by the second quarter of 2024, an improvement compared to the 1.9% growth in 2022.\n\nIn terms of earnings, the average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls increased by 3.6% in July compared to a year ago. The robust growth in average hourly earnings, combined with the slower 12-month increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), a measure of the average price of consumer goods and services, of 2.9% in July, implies that American workers, on average, are experiencing a modest increase in their real purchasing power.\n\nActions that could strengthen the U.S. economy include sound fiscal and monetary policies. On the fiscal side, government spending and taxation policies that enhance the productivity of the country\u2019s resources, balanced with careful consideration of the potential impact on the budget deficit and national debt, would be beneficial. Examples include policies designed to improve educational and health outcomes, increase investment in public infrastructure and promote innovation and entrepreneurship. In terms of monetary policy, continued adherence by the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) to its \u201cdual mandate\u201d of maintaining price stability and maximum sustainable employment for the economy would be beneficial. So far, the Fed seems to have achieved the elusive \u201csoft landing\u201d for the economy by slowing down the rate of inflation without inducing a recession. But the Fed will need to maintain continued vigilance in carrying out this difficult balancing act.\n\nQ: Will interest rates go up or down this year? What could the government do to guard against inflation?\n\nLouie: At its July meeting, the U.S. Federal Reserve decided to keep interest rates unchanged to try to get inflation under control. In general, lowering interest rates tends to stimulate the economy and potentially increase the rate of inflation, while raising interest rates tends to slow the rate of inflation. But Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has suggested that the Fed may begin to lower interest rates at their next meeting in September and may enact several interest rate cuts by the end of the year.\n\nThe Fed believes that it can begin to cut interest rates because it has made significant progress in bringing down the rate of inflation and because U.S. labor market conditions have begun to cool. The most recent data indicate that the 12-month rate of increase was 2.9% for the Consumer Price Index and 2.5% for the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index, another measure of the prices people pay for goods and services. Both indices are slowly moving closer to the Fed\u2019s 2% target rate of inflation, which the Fed considers to be most consistent with its mandate of maintaining maximum employment and price stability. The pace of job growth has also slowed. Of course, the Fed is always careful to add that interest rate cuts will depend on whether additional inflation and employment data in the upcoming months will give them greater confidence that inflation is under control and the labor market is cooling down.\n\nEconomic theory and historical experience have taught us that the government can guard against inflation by avoiding excessive fiscal stimulus resulting from government spending and/or tax cuts, especially when the economy is at or close to its full potential level of employment and output, and avoiding excessive monetary stimulus resulting from increases in the money supply that exceed the economy\u2019s rate of growth. Additionally, government actions that boost the economy\u2019s productivity and aggregate output can help to guard against inflation.\n\nQ: How might \u201cshrinkflation\u201d and tax cuts affect voters?\n\nLouie: Inflation is one of the top issues on voters\u2019 minds as we approach the 2024 presidential election. Given the persistence of inflation during the past three years, some voters have expressed concern that companies have been engaging in unscrupulous practices such as \u201cprice gouging\u201d whereby prices are raised beyond what is necessary to offset higher costs, or packaging strategies resulting in \u201cshrinkflation\u201d whereby the amount or size of a product is reduced while the price remains the same.\n\nGiven this contentious issue, both presidential candidates have put forth proposals to help lower inflation. Democratic candidate Kamala Harris is expected to propose, among other recommendations, a federal government policy to restrict corporate price gouging. Former President Trump\u2019s policy proposals have included encouraging more domestic energy production to bring down the cost of fuel.\n\nSince inflation can impose significant financial hardship on American families, voters in the upcoming election are likely to scrutinize the different policy stances of the candidates to help keep inflation low.\n\nRegarding tax policy, tax cuts for individuals will increase the disposable incomes of voters. Typically, part of that extra disposable income will be spent on consumer purchases of goods and services and part of it will be saved. Since consumer spending accounts for roughly two-thirds of total spending in the economy, the increase in consumer purchases can potentially have a big impact on the economy. At the same time, the increase in savings made possible by the extra disposable income can help to finance additional investment in the economy. Consequently, with all else constant, most voters tend to favor tax cuts and prefer political candidates who pledge to cut taxes or at least avoid raising taxes.\n\nThe actual impact of tax cuts on the economy will of course depend on which specific taxes are cut, the size of the tax cuts, the distribution of the tax cuts across different income classes and whether the tax cuts are temporary or permanent. Over a longer period, tax cuts can have additional impacts such as inflation and higher interest rates resulting from high levels of aggregate spending, or future tax increases to offset government budgetary shortfalls.\n\nQ: How is the U.S. labor force doing?\n\nLouie: As of July, the total U.S. civilian non-institutional population, defined as people aged 16 and older who are not inmates and not on active duty in the Armed Forces, was 268.6 million. Of this total population, the size of the U.S. civilian labor force was 168 million. Therefore, the \u201clabor force participation rate\u201d in the U.S. is currently at 62.7%. Among those in the labor force, the number employed was 161.3 million and the number of unemployed was 7.2 million. Therefore, the \u201cemployment-population ratio\u201d is currently at 60.0% while the unemployment rate is at 4.3%.\n\nAlthough the labor force participation rate and the employment-population ratio are both higher compared to where they were during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, they are still below their pre-pandemic levels. And as noted above, the monthly unemployment rate has remained below 4% on a seasonally adjusted basis throughout 2023 and early 2024.\n\nSince labor resources play an essential role in the growth and vitality of the economy, actions to strengthen the quantity and quality of the U.S. labor force are important. For example, tax and regulatory policies that provide incentives or reduce constraints for participating in the labor force can increase the size of the labor force, while economic policies that promote investments in education and training can enhance productivity.\n\nQ: How will the growing unionization of labor influence the election?\n\nLouie: The number of workers represented by unions has grown in recent years, although the percent of wage and salary workers who are members of unions has remained relatively stable at about 10% in 2023.\n\nOne potential impact of the growth in the number of union workers is increased voter turnout. According to a report by the Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation at the Harvard Kennedy School, \u201cunion members are significantly more likely than non-union members to vote in presidential and congressional elections, controlling for individual-level characteristics such as education, income and occupation\u201d as well as other political factors. Moreover, research suggests that there may be a \u201cspillover effect\u201d whereby citizens living in states with stronger unions are more likely to vote, controlling for demographic characteristics and political factors.\n\nThe impact of the growth in the number of union workers on the outcome of the upcoming presidential election is more difficult to ascertain. Historically, Democrats have received strong support from organized labor. Polling results from the Pew Research Center indicate that \u201ca majority (59%) of union members affiliate with the Democratic Party.\u201d Nevertheless, there are also indications that the Republican Party has succeeded in garnering some union support. For example, the president of the Teamsters Union gave one of the keynote speeches at the Republican National Convention. It is therefore somewhat uncertain how the growth in the number of union workers will ultimately influence the outcome of the election.\n\nFor more information or to speak with one of our election experts, visit media.psu.edu or contact mediarelations@psu.edu.",

        "text": "Kamala Harris and Donald Trump battle over US election\u2019s biggest issue\nTrump and Harris battle over election\u2019s biggest issue\n\nGetty Images\n\nAfter almost a year off the platform, Donald Trump returned to X this week and asked his 89 million followers: \u201cAre you better off now than you were when I was president?\u201d It was a clear echo of the famous quote from Ronald Reagan during his victorious 1980 presidential campaign, when he asked: \u201cAre you better off today than you were four years ago?\u201d This messaging isn\u2019t surprising. It seems like an obvious strategy for Trump to focus on the economy. That\u2019s because polls consistently suggest it\u2019s the issue American voters care about the most. One such poll conducted by The Economist and YouGov in recent days listed \u201cinflation/prices\u201d and \u201cjobs and the economy\u201d among voters\u2019 top concerns. Perhaps more importantly, polls also indicate voters are deeply unhappy with the current state of affairs. That seems like a perfect situation for any presidential challenger. But in an election that\u2019s been transformed by Kamala Harris taking over from Joe Biden as the Democratic candidate, Trump seems to be struggling to land his simple message on the economy. It is less than a month since he was on stage at the Republican National Convention looking unbeatable, having survived an assassination attempt and riding high in the opinion polls. Now, he has lost that lead and seems to have lost his way. Meanwhile, in the opposition corner, Ms Harris is riding a wave of excitement and enthusiasm that he is finding difficult to counter. The easiest way to burst her bubble would be to remind voters how unhappy they are about high prices and blame her for the inflation that has pushed up the cost of living during the time she has been beside President Biden in the White House.\n\nOne of the reasons Trump is failing to land that message is the Harris campaign\u2019s strategy of putting proposals to try to lower the cost of living at the heart of her pitch. In a speech in North Carolina on Friday, Ms Harris promised to expand child tax credits, help people to purchase their first homes, and to encourage the building of more affordable housing. She also said she hoped to tackle the persistently high price of food and groceries by banning \u201cprice gouging\u201d or excessive corporate profiteering. \"By any measure, our economy is the strongest in the world,\u201d she said. \u201cMany Americans don't yet feel that progress in their daily lives.\" Joe Biden and Kamala Harris ought to be able to boast about some very good economic indicators. There is strong growth, record levels of job creation, and this week the inflation rate fell below 3% for the first time during Mr Biden\u2019s presidency. But because prices are still high, voters don\u2019t feel any better off. Voters don\u2019t care about the rate of inflation \u2013 they care about the level of prices. \u201cA central banker wants inflation to get back to target. A shopper wants his or her old price back,\" Jared Bernstein, the chair of President Biden\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, said in a July speech. When it comes to the economy, \u201cthe vibes are off\u201d. \u201cVibes matter,\u201d Mr Bernstein said.\n\nThe policies from Democrats are \"hurting the working man\", says Jeff Tester\n\nSo will the bad economic vibes hurt the Harris campaign? That is what I asked voters over lunch at a crab shack on the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland. Jeff Tester, who works in a nearby marina, said high prices are really hurting him. \u201cI get paid by the hour. I get up to go to work every day. I think you have to do that to get the American dream,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I just know it's getting harder.\u201d And he is very clear about who he sees as responsible. \u201cI blame the Democrats. I believe their policies are hurting the working man,\u201d he said. Every diner I met complained about inflation, but not everyone held Mr Biden or Ms Harris responsible. Dan Nardo, a retired boat broker, said he believed the pandemic, oil prices, foreign wars and supply chain issues have more to do with price rises than the US president.\n\nRandy Turk isn't sure either presidential candidate will make much of a difference on inflation\n\nHis friend Randy Turk, a retired lawyer, told me that he felt a new administration is likely to follow a similar path to try to reduce inflation, regardless of who wins. \u201cIt's not like a different president can really make that much of a difference,\u201d he said. Ms Harris struggled for prominence and media coverage during most of her time as vice-president. Previously that was seen as a weakness. But if it means she can emerge untainted by \u201cBidenomics\u201d, it could be one of her greatest strengths. Ruth Igielnik, polling editor at the New York Times, says the latest data she has collected suggests \u201cvoters very much tied their negative feelings about the economy to Joe Biden\u201d. Talking to me on the BBC\u2019s Americast podcast, she explained that in her polling Trump is still favoured on the economy, but where he once had an 18-point lead over Mr Biden he now leads Ms Harris by only about 8 points. \u201cThat makes me think voters aren\u2019t necessarily attaching their feelings about the economy to her,\u201d she said. A separate poll this week conducted for the Financial Times and the University of Michigan Ross School of Business indicated Ms Harris holds a narrow lead over Trump on who Americans trust to handle the economy. No wonder Republicans are publicly begging Trump to focus on the issues, the economy in particular, and stop launching personal attacks against Ms Harris. In a speech this week, Trump told supporters he was going to talk about the economy but struggled to stay on topic. \u201cThey say it\u2019s the most important subject,\u201d he said, \"they\" referring to his advisers and strategists who believe this is his strongest line of attack. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it is. But they say it\u2019s the most important,\u201d he added, before going on to list immigration, crime and the way Ms Harris laughs as top issues. You could practically hear his campaign managers pulling their hair out. \u201cVoters don\u2019t care about personalities or who is drawing larger crowd sizes,\u201d said Matt Terrill, former chief of staff for Marco Rubio\u2019s presidential campaign. \u201cIndependent, undecided, swing voters in key states care about the economy and inflation so just focus on those core issues,\u201d he said. \u201cStay focused on talking about how you are going to make the lives of Americans better over the next four years.\u201d It was back in 1992 that the Democrat Jim Carville coined the slogan \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid\u201d while he was working on Bill Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign. It\u2019s advice that every campaign since has clung to. But Trump, this time around, seems to be finding it uncommonly difficult to stick with. It ought to be a winner for him. After all, according to the Financial Times poll, in answer to his question \u201cAre you better off now than you were when I was president?\u201d only 19% of voters say they are.",

        "text": "VP debate hosted by CBS News set for Oct. 1 between Vance and Walz\nWashington \u2014 The vice presidential debate hosted by CBS News is set for Oct. 1 in New York City, with Democratic Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota and GOP Sen. JD Vance of Ohio both agreeing to participate.\n\nThe debate will be moderated by \"CBS Evening News\" anchor and managing editor Norah O'Donnell and \"Face the Nation\" moderator and CBS News chief foreign affairs correspondent Margaret Brennan.\n\nOn Wednesday, CBS News proposed four dates for a debate between the two vice presidential nominees: Sept. 17, Sept. 24, Oct. 1, and Oct. 8. The Harris-Walz campaign soon agreed to the Oct. 1 date.\n\n\"See you on October 1, JD,\" Walz wrote on X. A campaign official said Walz \"looks forward to debating JD Vance \u2014 if he shows up.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Vance posted on social media that he accepted the CBS News debate on Oct. 1, and said he also wanted to debate on CNN on Sept. 18.\n\n\"The American people deserve as many debates as possible, which is why President Trump has challenged Kamala to three of them already,\" Vance wrote on X. \"Not only do I accept the CBS debate on October 1st, I accept the CNN debate on September 18th as well. I look forward to seeing you at both!\"\n\nIn the afternoon, Michael Tyler, the communications director for Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign, said Walz will only participate in the CBS debate on Oct. 1. He also reiterated Harris intention to debate Trump on Sept. 10, and said she would agree to one more meeting sometime in October.\n\nThe vice presidential debate\n\nSen. JD Vance, left, and Gov. Tim Walz. Getty Images\n\nA date for the vice presidential debate has been in limbo since the spring, when CBS News first extended the invitation to both presidential campaigns. In May, President Biden's campaign said Harris, who was still his running mate at the time, was willing to face off against the eventual Republican vice presidential nominee on either July 23 or Aug. 13.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump picked Vance as his running mate on July 15, the first day of the Republican National Convention. His campaign soon declined to commit to a vice presidential debate before the Democratic National Convention on Aug. 19, saying that doing so would be premature since Harris might end up being the Democratic nominee.\n\nMr. Biden dropped out of the race on July 21, several weeks after his own poor showing at his debate with Trump. Harris quickly gathered the support needed to replace him atop the Democratic ticket and formally captured the nomination last week. She named Walz as her running mate, finalizing the vice presidential picks for both campaigns and kicking off a sprint to the election in November.\n\nLast week, Trump said CBS News would host the vice presidential debate, and that Vance has \"really stepped up\" and is \"doing a fantastic job.\" He added that he was willing to participate in three debates with Harris in September, hosted by Fox News, ABC News and NBC News.\n\nThe Harris campaign initially committed to one debate, the Sept. 10 meeting on ABC. The Thursday statement from Tyler, Harris' communications director, indicated she was open to one more the following month, saying \"the American people will have another opportunity to see the vice president and Donald Trump on the debate stage in October.\"\n\n\"The debate about debates is over,\" Tyler said. \"Voters deserve to see the candidates for the highest office in the land share their competing visions for our future. The more they play games, the more insecure and unserious Trump and Vance reveal themselves to be to the American people. Those games end now.\"\n\nThis year is the first election cycle since 1988 in which the debates are not being organized by the nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates. In 2022, the Republican National Committee voted to ban GOP nominees from participating in debates hosted by the commission, accusing the organizers of bias in the two 2020 meetings between Mr. Biden and Trump.\n\nInstead, television networks have been left to negotiate dates and terms for the debates directly with the presidential campaigns. CNN hosted the first debate of the cycle between Mr. Biden and Trump in June, a much earlier start than in previous election years. CNN allowed other networks to carry the debate on their airwaves, in keeping with the practice for debates hosted by the commission.",

She can\u2019t afford to lose votes\n\nPosted on: 16 August 2024\n\nDaniel Geary, School of Histories and Humanities, writes in the Irish Times about how what happens at next week\u2019s Democratic convention in Chicago may determine whether or not Harris wins the US presidential election in November.\n\n\u201cThe whole world is watching.\u201d So chanted anti-war demonstrators in the summer of 1968 as they were brutalised by Chicago police outside the Democratic convention. The party was torn apart and lost the presidency. You\u2019d think Democrats would never want to hold their convention in Chicago again. But next week they are. The whole world will again be watching, this time to see if Kamala Harris can maintain the momentum and party unity she\u2019ll need to defeat Donald Trumpthis November.\n\n1968 is the only time when a president decided not to seek re-election after his party\u2019s primaries had already begun. Then, it was Lyndon Johnson; today, it\u2019s Joe Biden. Then, vice-president Humphrey ran instead; today, it\u2019s vice-president Harris. The main issue in 1968 was the Vietnam War. Anti-war candidate Eugene McCarthy\u2019s surprising strong performance in the New Hampshire primary precipitated Johnson\u2019s decision to withdraw. Then, Robert Kennedy entered the race, pledging to de-escalate the war in Vietnam and to do more to address poverty and racial injustice.\n\nRichard Daley, the Irish-American mayor of Chicago, had promised anti-war protesters a hostile response. And he delivered. It was, as a later investigation called it, a \u201cpolice riot\u201d. Police viciously beat anti-war protesters, most of whom were nonviolent. They even attacked bystanders and journalists. The normally mild-mannered senator George McGovern, who was running in place of the recently assassinated Kennedy, shouted obscenities at the police from the window of his hotel room. The violence on the streets of the Chicago brought the conflict within the convention hall into the open. Jewish senator Abraham Ribicoff accused Daley of \u201cGestapo tactics\u201d. Daley replied with a string of anti-Semitic expletives.\n\nViolence and division at this year\u2019s Democratic convention are unlikely to reach 1968 levels. Chicago mayor Brandon Johnson is no Richard Daley. He promises to protect protesters, not attack them. And Gaza is not Vietnam. This is a war being fought by a foreign ally of the US, not by American troops. Yet many coming to Chicago care deeply about the war in Gaza. Pro-Palestinian activists plan large demonstrations outside the convention. They will protest the Biden administration\u2019s continued backing of Israeli ethnic cleansing and war crimes. They will be joined by some within the convention hall. Some delegates were elected on \u201cuncommitted\u201d ballots (ie, not pledge to any candidate) specifically to protest Biden\u2019s policies on the war. Also, a growing number of Democratic politicians have also become vocal critics of Biden. Expect contentious debate within the party that would be exacerbated by any violence in the streets.\n\nThe convention is the next big test for Harris. Her campaign could hardly have gone better since she took over from Biden a few weeks ago. She has brought tremendous energy to the race. She is now leading polls against Trump in key battleground states. Her savvy choice of Tim Walz as her vice-presidential candidate showed that she understands the need to rally the party behind her. Her other options would have alienated the party\u2019s progressive wing.\n\nBut Harris is walking a tightrope when it comes to the ongoing horrific Israeli war on Gaza. Harris signalled that she has a different attitude toward it than Biden. After meeting with Binyamin Netanyahu last month, she said she \u201cwill not be silent\u201d about Palestinian suffering. But such sentiments are unlikely to satisfy pro-Palestinian protesters. And nor should they. The US is providing Israel with the weapons it is using to fight this war. When you are providing the instruments of suffering, saying you won\u2019t be silent doesn\u2019t suffice.\n\nHarris can meet the concerns of pro-Palestinian critics by doing three things. First, she can reiterate the need for an immediate ceasefire. The Biden administration has in fact shifted on this issue; its initial enthusiasm for the war has dampened. Second, Harris can acknowledge that pro-Palestinian activists have a right to protest. Finally, she can signal a future willingness to change American policy of unqualified military support for Israel.\n\nHarris\u2019s best argument is this: the alternative to her is Trump, who would be worse on this issue as on so many others. But to prevail against Trump, Harris needs her party united behind her. She cannot afford to lose any votes over Gaza in an election that stands on the razor\u2019s edge. What happens next week in Chicago may determine whether or not Harris wins in November. In 1968, Humphrey lost a close election to Nixon at least partly because anti-war voters abstained. Let us hope history does not repeat itself.\n\nThis article was first published in The Irish Times. Read the original article on the Irish Times website.",

        "text": "What to know about US election hacking, Iran and other countries\nWhat to know about US election hacking, Iran and other countries\n\nReuters The Trump campaign recently said it had been hacked by Iran\n\nThe recent claim by Donald Trump's campaign that they were hacked by Iran is one sign that foreign interference may become a prominent issue in this year's US election. The election result will have major implications around the world, meaning many countries have an incentive to try and interfere to either support a particular candidate or just to destabilise America. And the nature of America\u2019s open democracy and media, coupled with new forms of technology, provides many potential avenues to try and shape the eventual outcome. \u201cOur adversaries do look at American elections as points to try to influence, to try to undermine confidence in our democracy, to try to put their thumb on the scale,\u201d National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said last month. \u201cWe are clear eyed about that. And we are doing a lot to push back against it\". So who might be trying to interfere? Three countries are most widely cited: Iran, Russia and China.\n\nIran\n\n\u201cIran is becoming increasingly aggressive in their foreign influence efforts, seeking to stoke discord and undermine confidence in our democratic institutions,\u201d US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said in July. The Trump campaign says it was hacked by Iran, although it has not been confirmed that an offer of stolen campaign documents to news outlets was definitely linked to this. Microsoft recently said it had seen \"the emergence of significant influence activity\" by groups linked to Iran, and Google has said Iranian hackers targeted the Biden campaign (before he dropped out of the race) as well as that of Donald Trump. The assessment is that the Iranians are more likely to be opposed to a return of Trump to the White House. He and his advisers are seen as more hawkish in their rhetoric as well as in their past actions, which include pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal and killing top Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in January 2020. On social media, Iran has also been accused of stoking tensions over Gaza.\n\nRussia\n\n\u201cRussia remains the predominant threat to US elections,\u201d according to the most recent assessment by US intelligence. But so far it has been less visible than Iran. Russia has a long track record of using what it calls \"active measures\" to influence public opinion back through the Cold War. And in 2016, the US was caught largely unaware by a Russian operation which saw the Democratic Party as well as Hillary Clinton's campaign operatives have their emails hacked and then leaked.\n\nMore on the US election\n\nRussian hackers \u2013 likely from both the foreign intelligence agency the SVR and the military intelligence agency the GRU \u2013 are among the most skilled and may try to compromise accounts. Russian social media campaigns have also moved on from 2016 when fake profiles were used to organise real-world demonstrations against Hillary Clinton during the campaign. Moscow is thought to be outsourcing some efforts to commercial firms in order to distance itself and look for more effective ways of reaching audiences. If Moscow does get involved, security analysts believe it it would most likely be to favour Trump. The former president has been more friendly to Moscow and more critical of the NATO defence alliance. Russia's Vladimir Putin recently denied he was backing Trump, but even that was seen as a diversionary tactic.\n\nChina\n\nChina is the wildcard in terms of interference. It has hacked US campaigns to gather intelligence all the way back to 2008. But it tends to be less active than the other two in trying to influence a particular result. US intelligence currently believe it \"probably does not plan to influence the outcome\" of the election. There is also less confidence as to who China\u2019s preferred candidate might be should it decide to do anything. Donald Trump can be unpredictable and confrontational with Beijing but is less likely to continue the Biden administration\u2019s policy of building a web of alliances, which has worried Beijing.\n\nTrump or Biden: Will China\u2019s Communist Party elite reveal who they back?\n\nBeijing may also be wary of antagonising the US at this point by being seen to interfere, something neither Iran nor Russia worry so much about. But China is accused of trying to target candidates at a local or congressional level because of their backgrounds or positions on issues of concern to China. In the 2022 mid-terms it was assessed of doing so in a handful of races involving both Democrats and Republicans. All three countries have consistently denied carrying out election interference operations.\n\nThe challenges for the US\n\nBack in 2016, material hacked by Russia received extensive media coverage. But that seems to have changed now with media outlets more cautious about giving prominence to stolen data. And there there are more people now looking for influence operations as well as improved cybersecurity defences around campaigns. But despite this, the challenge has evolved. One complexity is that it can be harder to disentangle foreign interference from domestic free speech. Some countries may use Americans to seed or spread their messages. Sometimes those Americans will be willing collaborators, but sometimes they will be unwitting, perhaps even engaged to write for websites which they do not know work for Moscow or someone else. And there are new worries because there has been a step change in the technology on offer to those seeking to interfere thanks to artificial intelligence and deepfakes. These potentially allow more tailored approaches to individuals over social media, and the creation of more convincing faked content. This could lead people to doubt what is real and what is not. However, in other elections around the world this year, the general consensus is that these techniques have not been deployed as much as some feared. But America\u2019s election is by far the most consequential globally (and also likely a tight race) meaning new techniques might be deployed for the first time. And given the political atmosphere this time is more combustible and polarised than in the past. A further risk, too, is that even the claim that there has been foreign interference can be politicised and used to cast doubt on an election result.",

Harris noted it was her 16th visit to the state since becoming vice president \u2014 and President Biden's first stop after the fateful debate performance that ultimately led to his departure from the race.\n\nHarris said she would offer more details about her economic plan in the weeks ahead but on Friday, she focused efforts to lower the cost of living.\n\n\"When I am elected president, I will make it a top priority to bring down costs and increase economic security for all Americans,\" Harris said at Wake Tech Community College in Raleigh. \"As president, I will take on the high costs that matter most to most Americans, like the cost of food. We all know that prices went up during the pandemic when the supply chains shut down and failed. But our supply chains have now improved. And prices are still too high.\"\n\nHarris also blasted former President Donald Trump over his economic policies. She said Trump would impose \"what is in effect a national sales tax,\" referring to recent remarks Trump made about expanding tariffs on goods imported into the U.S. by 10-20%.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris speaks at a campaign event at Hendrick Center for Automotive Excellence on the Scott Northern Wake Campus of Wake Tech Community College in Raleigh, N.C., Friday, Aug. 16, 2024. Mike Stewart / AP\n\nNew housing\n\nHarris is calling for the construction of 3 million new housing units in her first four years in office. The Biden administration has previously called for the construction of 2 million new homes.\n\nShe wants to incentivize these new units with a tax break for builders who construct properties for first-time home buyers. She is also proposing a $40 billion fund to help local governments find solutions to the lack of housing supply.\n\n\"There's a serious housing shortage. In many places, it's too difficult to build, and it's driving prices up,\" Harris said. \"As president, I will work in partnership with industry to build the housing we need, both to rent and to buy. We will take down barriers and cut red tape, including at the state and local levels. And by the end of my first term, we will end America's housing shortage by building 3 million new homes and rentals that are affordable for the middle class.\"\n\nCampaign officials said Harris will call on Congress to pass the Preventing the Algorithmic Facilitation of Rental Housing Cartels Act, which would prevent landlords from using price-fixing algorithms to increase rents. She also wants lawmakers to pass the Stop Predatory Investing Act, a bill that would limit tax breaks for large investors and private equity firms that acquire single-family rental homes in bulk.\n\n\"Some corporate landlords, some of them, buy dozens if not hundreds of houses and apartments,\" Harris said. \"Then they turn them around and rent them out at extremely high prices. And it can make it impossible then for regular people to buy or even rent a home.\"\n\nHarris will also propose providing Americans who have paid their rent on time for two years with up to $25,000 in down-payment assistance, with more support for first-generation homeowners.\n\nExpansion of Child Tax Credit\n\nHarris is also proposing an expansion of the Child Tax Credit to provide a $6,000 tax cut to families with newborns. GOP vice presidential nominee and Ohio Sen. JD Vance has proposed a similar but more general $5,000 Child Tax Credit expansion. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget pointed out that this Vance's proposal, which is 150% above the current $2,000 tax credit, could mean creating trillions in debt. \"We could easily be talking about $2-$3 trillion in additional borrowing over the next decade,\" Marc Goldwein, senior policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, told CBS MoneyWatch regarding the Vance proposal.\n\nVance has suggested his tax credit would not be subject to income thresholds, while Harris' proposal would apply to lower- and middle-income families.\n\nTrump campaign senior adviser Brian Hughes said there's been \"a lot of talk from the Harris campaign criticizing Senator Vance and campaign for advocating for policies that are pro-family and meant to support those who are raising children. So it is a bit ironic to see the Vice President Harris suddenly embrace policies that she seemed to stop at just a few weeks ago.\"\n\nHarris also wants to restore the Child Tax Credit to the pandemic-era American Rescue Plan levels, which would give working- and middle-class families with children up to $3,600 per child.\n\nShe is also proposing a Earned Income Tax Credit of $1,500 for those in lower-income jobs who aren't raising a child. The campaign also emphasized that Harris will ensure \"no one earning less than $400,000 a year will pay more in new taxes.\"\n\nBoth Vance's and Harris' proposals would require congressional approval.\n\nAddressing inflation\n\nIn North Carolina, Harris also talked about how much higher prices are for specific goods like bread than they were pre-pandemic, something Mr. Biden has typically been less likely to do.\n\nIn the first 100 days of her administration, Harris, according to a campaign fact sheet, would work to bring down the cost of groceries by working with Congress on a federal ban on price gouging on groceries and other goods and new authorities for the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general to enable them to impose penalties on rule-breaking companies.\n\n\"Look, the bills add up,\" Harris said Friday. \"Food, rent, gas, back to school clothes, prescription medication \u2014 after all that, for many families, there's not much left at the end of the month.\"\n\nExtreme consolidation in the food industry has led to higher prices that account for a large part of higher grocery bills. Harris plans to crack down on unfair mergers and acquisitions that give big food corporations the power to jack up food and grocery prices and undermine the competition that keeps prices low for consumers. And her plan aims to support smaller businesses, like grocery stores, meat processors, farmers and ranchers, so those industries can be more competitive.\n\nAccording to the most recent CBS News poll, only 9% of registered voters rated the condition of the national economy as \"very good,\" with the economy and inflation ranking as the top issue of concern consistently across 2024 polls. Inflation has cooled since its peak in June 2022, but many voters are still feeling financial strain. Prices are still 20% higher overall than prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn a statement, the Trump campaign accused Harris of trying to implement price controls, which it said \"have been tried \u2014 and failed \u2014 throughout history as they inevitably lead to food lines, shortages, and skyrocketing inequality.\" The Trump campaign also blamed Harris' and Mr. Biden's economic policies for creating the problem, \"aided and abetted by Harris's tiebreaking votes on trillions in inflationary spending.\" However, economists have said that pandemic-related federal spending by both Trump and Mr. Biden fueled high inflation.\n\nThroughout battleground states, voters often tell CBS News that the economy remains a top issue when heading to the voting booths.\n\n\"Workforce development, creating job opportunities, making sure everyone can advance in different career fields,\" said Abraham Camejo in Las Vegas ahead of Harris' rally on Saturday when asked about economic priorities. \"The policies that benefit big corporations and the middle class are different.\"\n\nAccording to a recent CBS News poll, on a question about policies that will improve people's finances, Harris trailed Trump with 45% of registered voters saying they'd be financially better off with the former president, compared to 25% for Harris.\n\nEliminating taxes on tips\n\nHarris' economic policy remarks followed her pledge last Saturday at a rally in Las Vegas to eliminate taxes on tips and raise the minimum wage.\n\n\"When I am president, we will continue our fight for working families including to raise the minimum wage and eliminate taxes on tips for service and hospitality workers,\" Harris said recently at a rally that included Nevada Culinary union members.\n\nA Harris-Walz campaign official noted that her pledge would require legislation.\n\nThis marked the first time Harris made a proposal on eliminating taxes on tips for service workers, a similar idea to one first pitched by Trump in June, also at a rally in Las Vegas.\n\nIn 2025, lawmakers are set to have a major opening on tax legislation given the expiration of some tax changes made during Trump's presidency in 2017. Control of Congress is likely to be a major factor on this issue, since Republicans held the House, Senate and White House when Trump's 2017 tax cuts became law.\n\ncontributed to this report.",

        "text": "Election 2024: The Democratic National Convention Begins on Monday\nDemocrats are in an upbeat mood as their national convention opens in Chicago on Monday. An election that seemed to be getting away from them just a month ago now seems winnable. The trend is the Democrats\u2019 friend at the moment.\n\nLike the Republican convention in Milwaukee last month, the Democrats\u2019 four-day gathering will be a highly scripted affair. But there will be at least one important difference. Former President George W. Bush, former vice presidents Dick Cheney, Mike Pence, and Dan Quayle, and former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney all skipped the Republican National Convention. The Democratic convention, in contrast, will showcase the party\u2019s past standard bearers.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton are set to speak Monday night. Expect the president to get a roaring ovation from the delegates. After all, they were initially selected to support his candidacy. Former President Barack Obama will speak Tuesday night in his hometown. Former President Bill Clinton will speak Wednesday night before vice presidential nominee Tim Walz speaks. Kamala Harris will accept the nomination, which was formally awarded earlier this month in a virtual vote, on Thursday night.\n\nThe Water's Edge James M.

The two candidates will campaign with their spouses, marking the first time the four have campaigned as a group. The tour will begin in Pittsburgh on Sunday and make multiple stops in western Pennsylvania. That\u2019s hardly by accident. The Keystone State is a must-win for the Harris-Walz ticket. And the bus tour won\u2019t head straight for the Windy City. Harris and Walz plan to hold a rally at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee on Tuesday. That\u2019s where the Republicans met last month. Wisconsin also happens to be a must-win state for the Democrats.\n\nThe stakes are high for Harris in Chicago. Most Americans know little about her. Donald Trump and JD Vance are busily trying to paint her as \u201cFailed. Weak. Dangerously liberal.\u201d Her Thursday night speech is her opportunity to define her own narrative and to present her vision for the country. She won\u2019t have another unchallenged opportunity to define herself at any other point during the campaign.\n\nDemocrats are hoping that Harris will rise to the occasion. If so, Chicago could propel her to victory much as it helped secure Clinton\u2019s reelection victory in 1996. But any Democratic gathering in Chicago brings back memories of the party\u2019s disastrous 1968 convention. Then, violent protests over the Vietnam War dominated the news coverage and likely cost Hubert Humphrey the presidency. It was cold comfort for Democrats that a national commission later blamed the violence on a \u201cpolice riot\u201d rather than on anti-war protestors.\n\nChicago expects thousands of protestors next week, with many of them demonstrating against U.S. support for Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. Those crowds won\u2019t match the number of protestors that Chicago saw fifty-six years ago even if they feel as passionately about their cause. Democratic officials seem more concerned about protests inside the convention hall. Thirty of the nearly 4,000 Democrats at the United Center next week are uncommitted. Most of them won their seats because of voters who opposed Biden\u2019s support for Israel\u2019s war.\n\nWhile the number of uncommitted delegates is small, a well-timed protest or viral moment could hurt the image of unity and confidence that Democrats want to project. For that reason, Democratic Party officials have been negotiating with leaders of the Uncommitted National Movement over whether critics of U.S. policy toward Gaza will be allowed to address the convention. Those discussions have yet to yield a resolution.\n\nIf the Democrats can navigate this and other challenges that emerge over the next week, they might extend the impressive string of success Harris has enjoyed since Biden stepped aside. But as Republicans learned just last month, events can quickly derail a friendly trend.\n\nCampaign Update\n\nTim Walz on Wednesday accepted an invitation from CBS News to debate JD Vance in New York City on Tuesday, October 1. Vance told Fox News on Wednesday night that \u201cI strongly suspect we\u2019re gonna be there on October 1\u201d and said \u201cwe should do more than one debate.\u201d He then hedged by saying \u201cwe\u2019re not gonna run, walk into a fake news media garbage debate.\u201d By yesterday morning, the hedging was gone. Vance not only accepted the CBS invitation, he announced that he had accepted an invitation from CNN to debate Walz on September 18. The Harris campaign responded with a statement that appeared to reject the call for a second vice-presidential debate while insisting on the need for a second presidential debate. Vance\u2019s reacted by tweeting: \u201cTim Walz refuses to deploy!\u201d\n\nPolitico reported on Saturday that someone named \u201cRobert\u201d began sending them internal communications from a senior Trump campaign official along with a copy of a lengthy report the campaign had compiled on JD Vance\u2019s potential political vulnerabilities. Other news outlets quickly acknowledged that they had received a similar offer. The Trump campaign confirmed the hack, which it attributed to \u201cforeign sources hostile to the United States.\u201d Trump personally blamed Iran, saying that it was likely because \u201cI was strong on Iran and I was protecting people in the Middle East that maybe they aren\u2019t so happy about that.\u201d The FBI is now investigating the hack, which began by gaining access to the email account of Trump confidante Roger Stone. Google said on Wednesday that a group tied to Iran has been trying to hack the Biden and Trump campaigns since May. Unlike in 2016, when the Hillary Clinton campaign\u2019s hacked emails were given to Wikileaks and then published by news outlets, none of the news outlets that have received the hacked emails have published them.\n\nTrump returned to X for the first time in almost a year on Monday. He posted a campaign video portraying himself as the victim of politicized criminal prosecutions and touted his interview that night with Elon Musk. Other than posting a spoof video of him and Musk dancing to the turn of \u201cStayin\u2019 Alive\u201d and the audio of his conversation with Musk, Trump has limited his social media posts to his Truth Social account.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyers yesterday asked Judge Juan Merchan to postpone the sentencing of the former president on his thirty-four felony convictions for falsifying business records. Sentencing is currently set for September 18. The lawyers argued that by adjourning sentencing until after Election Day, \"which is of paramount importance to the entire Nation, the Court would reduce, even if not eliminate, issues regarding the integrity of any future proceedings.\" Merchan has not announced when he will rule on the request.\n\nArizona and Missouri this week became the latest states to add a referendum on abortion rights to their ballots in November. Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Nevada, and South Dakota already have similar ballot initiatives scheduled. Democrats applauded the news, believing it will help the Harris-Walz ticket and Democratic congressional candidates by increasing the turnout of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters. In the two years since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, abortion-rights referenda have passed every time they have been on the ballot, including in red states like Kansas and Ohio.\n\nWhat the Candidates Are Saying\n\nThe potential for artificial intelligence (AI) to sow disinformation in the 2024 campaign has gained a lot of attention. What has gained far less attention is that false claims about AI-generated material can also be used to discredit accurate information. Trump highlighted that danger on Sunday when he posted on Truth Social that the Harris campaign had used AI to generate fake crowds in photos of a campaign stop.\n\nSimilar posts were widely shared on X, Facebook, and Instagram as well. The problem is that the claims were false. The photos weren\u2019t doctored, by AI, Photoshop, or any other technology. Trump, however, didn\u2019t retract his charge or take down his post.\n\nMuch like Ron DeSantis\u2019s ill-fated campaign launch on X last year, Trump\u2019s interview with Musk got off to a rocky start. Technical problems delayed the start of their conversation for forty minutes.\n\nWhen the conversation did get underway, it consisted mostly of Musk asking Trump softball questions. Musk made clear that was his intent, saying he had no intention of being \u201cadversarial\u201d and instead wanted \u201cto just get a feel for what Donald Trump is just like in a conversation. Policy issues largely got the short shrift in the conversation. Musk did ask Trump about climate change. He dismissed it as a concern, saying that \u201coceans are gonna rise one eighth-of-an-inch over the next four hundred years\u201d and that will mean \u201cyou will have more oceanfront property.\u201d (That first claim is flat wrong; the second could well be true, but not in a good way.) Many listeners noted that Trump seemed to lisp and slur his words during the interview. Trump later acknowledged the problem, blaming it on modern technology.\n\nTrump gave what was billed as a major speech on the economy Wednesday in Asheville, North Carolina. However, the former president didn\u2019t seem to have much enthusiasm for the assignment. Early on, he seemed to mock his task, calling it \u201can intellectual speech\u201d and the audience members \u201care all intellectuals today.\u201d He then veered off course to complain that the United States \u201chas become a third-world nation\u201d and \u201ca banana republic\u201d that is \u201cstarting a freefall.\u201d He also launched into his standard personal attacks, saying that Harris is \u201cnot smart. She\u2019s not intelligent.\u201d\n\nWhen Trump did address economic issues, he promised that the economy would grow so rapidly under his leadership that \u201cwe will pay off all our debt.\u201d He made a similar promise in 2016. Instead, the national debt grew by nearly $8 trillion during his presidency. He also pledged to cut income taxes and end taxes on Social Security and tips, all of which would drive up the annual federal deficit and the national debt. He also pledged to lower energy costs by \u201c50 to 70 percent\u201d within a year or at a \u201cmaximum 18 months.\u201d\n\nYesterday, Trump held his second press conference in a week. As with Wednesday\u2019s speech, the idea was that the former president would hit the Harris-Waltz ticket on economic issues. He stuck to his script for a while before, as Politico put it, he \u201conce again veered off topic, weighing in on windmills killing birds, repeatedly falsely claiming Harris is a communist, pontificating on the weight of electric trucks and bragging about the audience size of his glitchy conversation on X with tech mogul Elon Musk.\u201d He also continued to insult Harris, saying: \u201cI think I\u2019m entitled to personal attacks. I don\u2019t have a lot of respect for her.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the day at an event on combatting antisemitism, Trump noted that he had given the Presidential Medal of Freedom to the woman who introduced him, Miriam Adelson, one of his most generous campaign donors. Trump went on to say that the Medal of Freedom is \u201cthe equivalent of the Congressional (sic) Medal of Honor, but civilian version. It\u2019s actually much better because everyone [who] gets the Congressional Medal of Honor, they're soldiers. They\u2019re either in very bad shape because they\u2019ve been hit so many times by bullets or they\u2019re dead.\u201d Trump\u2019s comments sparked sharp criticism and resurfaced his previous remarks denigrating Americans who have made the ultimate sacrifice for their country.\n\nWhat the Pundits Are Saying\n\nBloomberg\u2019s David Marchick wrote that Trump\u2019s election in November would likely usher in a chaotic transition. Each incoming administration has eleven weeks to make a dent in selecting its cabinet and filling some 4,000 senior government positions. Making that go smoothly requires advance planning. However, \u201cTrump has not appointed a transition director or team to prepare for his presidency should he be elected again, nor has he publicly communicated his plans to do so. By this time four years ago, the Biden-Harris ticket had not only appointed transition leaders but had several hundred people working full time on planning.\u201d\n\nPaul Musgrave argued in Foreign Policy that Walz has held a consistent view of China ever since he taught English there in the late 1980s. According to Musgrave, Walz is \u201ca measured critic of the Chinese Communist Party\u2014prone neither to exaggeration nor accommodation. Nor is this a pose cooked up by spin doctors in the past few weeks. Small-town Nebraska newspaper articles\u2014published well before Walz had any political ambitions\u2014demonstrate that his professed affection for the Chinese people and culture has been matched by a longstanding criticism of the country\u2019s rulers.\u201d\n\nJoe Cirincione wrote in Defense One that Trump\u2019s call for building an Iron Dome over the United States is nonsensical. Cirincione noted that the United States has spent $415 billion over the past four decades on defenses against long-range missiles and succeeded in building a system that works roughly half the time against limited attacks under ideal conditions. The prospects of building a system that works against large-scale attacks are nil. If Trump has in mind replicating Israel\u2019s Iron Dome system, it \u201cis designed to intercept relatively primitive rockets and mortars that travel under 44 miles. That is fine if you want to defend San Diego from rockets launched from Tijuana, some 35 miles away. But the system couldn\u2019t even protect Mar-a-Lago from missiles fired from the Bahamas, some 80 miles away.\u201d Perhaps even more important, neither Canada nor Mexico is deploying short-range missiles to threaten the United States.\n\nWhat the Polls Show\n\nThe latest Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research assessed how Americans compared Harris and Trump on several leadership qualities. Harris fared better than Trump on which candidate was \u201ccommitted to democracy\u201d and \u201cdisciplined\u201d\u2014nearly half of respondents said those qualities better describe Harris, while three in ten said they better describe Trump. Four in ten respondents said that \u201chonest\u201d better describes Harris, while one in four said the term better describes Trump. Americans are roughly split on whether Harris or Trump is a strong leader and who would better handle a crisis, with each candidate getting roughly 40 percent support on both questions.\n\nThe Campaign Schedule\n\nThe Democratic National Convention opens in Chicago in three days (August 19, 2024).\n\nThe second presidential debate is in twenty-five days (September 10, 2024)\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s sentencing hearing on his New York felony convictions is in thirty-three days (September 18, 2024).\n\nThe first in-person absentee voting in the nation begins in Minnesota and South Dakota in thirty-five days (September 20, 2024).\n\nElection Day is eighty-one days away.\n\nInauguration Day is 157 days away.\n\nShelby Sires assisted in the preparation of this post.",

        "text": "After years of doubt, Kamala Harris becomes Democrats' leader\nLong-doubted by Democrats, Kamala Harris faces her biggest political moment\n\nBBC\n\nWhen Kamala Harris steps onto the stage at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago this week as the party\u2019s presidential nominee, she\u2019ll do so knowing that many in the audience cheering her on once counted her out. Ms Harris, 59, has faced years of doubt from some within her party about her ability to run for America\u2019s highest political office - including from President Joe Biden, the man whom she continues to serve as vice-president. Since replacing Mr Biden as Democratic nominee in mid-July, Ms Harris has seen a tidal wave of enthusiasm for her candidacy - reflected in polling, fundraising and the enormous crowds that have come out to see her at rallies across the country. But the political momentum and energy she has generated in recent weeks among Democrats was never a given. After failing in a short-lived presidential bid in 2019, she began her vice-presidency on a shaky footing, beset by stumbles in high-profile interviews, staff turnover and low approval ratings. And for the last three-and-a-half years in the White House she has struggled to break through to American voters. Advisers and allies say that in the years since those early struggles she has sharpened her political skills, created loyal coalitions within her party and built credibility on issues like abortion rights that energise the Democratic base. She has, in other words, been preparing for a moment exactly like this one. On Thursday, as she formally accepts the Democratic nomination, Ms Harris has an opportunity to reintroduce herself on the national stage with fewer than 80 days until an election that could see her become the nation\u2019s first female president. At the same time, she\u2019ll have to prove that she is capable of leading a party that never saw her as its natural leader and remains divided over the war in Israel and Gaza. But above all, she\u2019ll need put to rest any lingering doubt among the Democratic faithful that she can meet the challenge of defeating former president Donald Trump in what remains a tight and unpredictable contest.\n\nPath to the White House\n\nBefore Kamala Harris became a national figure, the former San Francisco district attorney and California attorney general had forged a reputation as a rising star in the party, landing the endorsement of President Barack Obama in her 2010 race to become the state\u2019s top lawyer. But those who followed her career closely saw a mixed record. As a prosecutor, she faced public outcry for refusing to seek the death penalty for a man convicted of killing a young police officer. And then as attorney-general, she upheld the state\u2019s death penalty despite her personal opposition. Having reached the peaks of California state politics, she was elected to the US Senate the same night that Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. In her brief tenure, she made headlines for her searing and direct questioning of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his testy 2018 confirmation hearings. \u201cCan you think of any laws that give government the power to make decisions about the male body?\u201d she asked the Trump appointee, in an exchange that cascaded across social media and late night television. Like Mr Obama, she was a young senator of limitless ambition. Halfway through her first term, she launched a presidential campaign. That campaign, like this one, was met with great fanfare. More than 20,000 people gathered in her hometown of Oakland, California, for its launch. But her effort to become the Democratic nominee sputtered and collapsed before the first presidential primary ballot was even cast. Ms Harris failed to carve out a clear political identity and distinguish herself in a field of rivals that included Mr Biden and left-wing senator Bernie Sanders. Critics said she endorsed a range of progressive policies but seemed to lack clear conviction. A breakthrough June 2019 debate moment in which she challenged her then-opponent Mr Biden\u2019s record on the racial desegregation of schools resulted in a brief surge in polling. She attacked Mr Biden for an earlier campaign moment in which he fondly recalled working with two segregationist senators, before accusing him of opposing the bussing of students between schools to help integrate them. \u201cThere was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bussed to school every day,\u201d Ms Harris said. \u201cAnd that little girl was me.\u201d\n\nBut campaign infighting and indecision on which issues to emphasise ultimately sank her presidential bid. The campaign was marked by \u201ca lot of rookie mistakes\u201d, said Kevin Madden, an adviser on Republican Mitt Romney\u2019s 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns. \u201cThe substance that needed to be there to pass the commander-in-chief test and to really fill in some of the blanks for voters, it just wasn\u2019t there and as a result her opponents filled it in for her.\u201d Eight months later, Mr Biden put aside their primary rivalry and announced Ms Harris as his running mate. She became the first woman of colour to ever be nominated in that position - and in January 2021, the first female vice-president in US history.\n\nA rocky start\n\nIt was five months into her job as Mr Biden\u2019s vice-president that Ms Harris endured her first public stumble during a foreign trip to Guatemala and Mexico. The trip was meant to showcase her role in pursuing economic initiatives to curb the flow of migrants from Central America to the US southern border, a foreign policy assignment given to her by Mr Biden. But it was quickly overshadowed by an awkward exchange in an interview with NBC News\u2019 Lester Holt, in which she dismissed repeated questions about why she had not yet visited the US-Mexico border.\n\nLater that day, during a press conference with Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei, Ms Harris tried to recapture the narrative, delivering a stark message to migrants thinking of making their way to the US. \u201cDo not come,\u201d she told them. \u201cDo not come.\u201d While the NBC News interview fuelled Republican attacks that continue to this day, the latter comments drew the ire of progressives and were quickly panned on social media, even though other administration officials had echoed the same rhetoric.\n\nThe vice-president\u2019s allies blamed the White House for failing to adequately prepare her and assigning an unwinnable issue. They complained that as the first woman, African-American and Asian-American to serve as vice-president, outsized expectations had been imposed on her from the very start of her term, giving her little time to settle. \u201cThere was immense pressure in the beginning to own things,\u201d said one former aide who was granted anonymity to speak candidly about their time in the White House. In the months that followed, Ms Harris endured more scrutiny as she faced high staff turnover, a slew of negative headlines about her performance and underwhelming media appearances. Hemmed in by Covid restrictions, she was limited in her public engagements, fuelling the perception that she was invisible. When critics labelled her a prop for standing behind Mr Biden at bill-signing ceremonies \u2013 as her white male predecessors in the role regularly did \u2013 a decision was made to remove her from those events altogether, according to aides, triggering more criticism that she was absent. \u201cPeople had an expectation to experience her as vice-president as if she was Michelle Obama, but she was in a job\u2026 built for Al Gore or Mike Pence,\u201d said Jamal Simmons, a longtime Democratic strategist who was brought in as her communications director during the second year.\n\nRoe v Wade and coalition politics\n\nAs her team sought to improve her poor public image, Ms Harris stepped into a bigger foreign policy role. She travelled to Poland in the wake of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, held bilateral meetings in Asia amid heightened tensions with China and stood in for Mr Biden at the Munich Security Conference that same year. But in May 2022, a political earthquake would reshape the trajectory of her vice-presidency. In a rare breach of the Supreme Court, a leaked draft opinion revealed plans to overturn the landmark Roe v Wade abortion ruling - which had protected American women\u2019s federal right to abortion for nearly half a century. She seized on the opportunity to be the lead messenger on an issue that Mr Biden \u2013 a devout Irish Catholic who avoided even saying the term \u201cabortion\u201d \u2013 was reluctant to own. \u201cHow dare they? How dare they tell a woman what she can and cannot do with her own body?\u201d she told the crowd at an event for a pro-choice group on the same day the bombshell leak was published, deciding to attack the nation\u2019s top judges before their decision was officially released. The issue proved to be a driving force for voters in the midterm elections a few months later, helping Democrats to perform better than expected in congressional races and to hold the Senate.\n\nIn seeking to become the administration\u2019s leading voice on abortion, Ms Harris tackled the issue with \u201cclarity of purpose\u201d, said former longtime adviser Rachel Palermo. She convened state legislators, faith leaders, constitutional law experts, healthcare providers and advocates for roundtable discussions. It was a move panned by some activists as not meeting the seriousness of the moment but it was part of a strategy of coalition-building across local and state politics that also helped lay the groundwork for any future presidential run. Ms Harris, who spent most of her career navigating California\u2019s tricky mix of liberal and traditional Democratic politics, knew every event mattered. Every meeting, photo opportunity or dinner - whether it was with black business leaders or Hispanic female CEOs \u2013 was tracked by her team in detailed spreadsheets that she could utilise when the time came to call on a deep political network for support. \u201cShe forced the operation to mobilise around how she views politics, which is coalitions,\u201d a senior official said. Ms Harris always had her eye on a 2028 bid for the White House, as Joe Biden\u2019s natural successor, assuming he won a second term in the 2024 contest. Yet as rumblings mounted about replacing Mr Biden on the ticket after his stumbling debate performance in late June against Donald Trump, some Democrats openly overlooked her. Kamala Harris's positions on 10 key issues\n\nThe 'blended' family behind Kamala Harris\n\nThey, and many pundits, suggested popular governors like California\u2019s Gavin Newsom, Pennsylvania\u2019s Josh Shapiro or Michigan\u2019s Gretchen Whitmer as better replacements who could motivate voters and take the fight to Trump. On 21 July, Mr Biden phoned Ms Harris to tell her of his plans to drop out of the race and endorse her as his successor. It was a decision that took many of his closest allies by surprise, but she sprang into action. Over the course of 10 hours that Sunday, she called more than 100 party officials, members of Congress, labour leaders and activists. Within days, any potential rivals, including the powerful governors, had fallen into line and it was clear that she would take the Democratic mantle with no serious challenge.\n\nAs a candidate, the vice-president has yet to lay out a detailed policy agenda or sit down for a tough media interview. She released an economic blueprint on Friday, calling for tax cuts for families and a wider push on capping drug pricing, her most detailed vision for the country so far. Even as Republicans accuse her of avoiding scrutiny, the team around her see no rush in cutting off the momentum she\u2019s built over the last month. Political strategists say the campaign is right to capitalise on the \u201csugar high\u201d. \u201cWhat Kamala Harris is experiencing is a massive, pent-up demand for people to vote for anybody not named Biden or Trump,\u201d said Mr Madden, the former Romney aide and Republican communications strategist. \u201cBut the test always comes with being exposed to interviews, the press, debates and the harsh glare of a campaign.\u201d Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian who helped organise a meeting of historians at Ms Harris\u2019s official residence last year, said the fact that she has been a blank slate for voters is more of a benefit than a burden. \u201cShe may not have been able to be in full bloom under Biden but she never crossed wires with him,\u201d he said. \u201cSo she was able to be positioned for this moment and she can take what\u2019s good about the Biden years and shed the baggage of what she wants to, or slightly disagrees with.\u201d Though her entrance has jolted an outpouring of support among Democrats, it\u2019s unclear whether she can translate that into broad appeal. While Ms Harris has made some inroads with key demographic groups that had drifted from Mr Biden \u2013 black, Latino and young voters in particular \u2013 she lags in other constituencies that made up his winning 2020 coalition. Recent polling puts her ahead or tied with Trump in six of the seven battleground states, according to a Cook Political Report survey released on Wednesday. In May, when Mr Biden was still the Democratic candidate, Trump was ahead or tied in all seven states.\n\nAnthony Zurcher analyses how Republicans are going after Harris - and how she's fighting back\n\n\u2018I was born with a seatbelt\u2019\n\nThursday night\u2019s speech at the Democratic convention is the most consequential moment in Kamala Harris\u2019s political career. While the Republican convention served as a coronation for Trump, who was nominated as his party\u2019s candidate for the third consecutive time, Ms Harris\u2019s sudden rise means her speech will be seen as a pivotal moment to define who she really is. While she\u2019s stood on the stage before, a senior aide said the speech will have a heavier focus on her personal story than previous nominees. \u201cThis is the why part of the conversation. Why is she running for president? What is her vision for the country?\u201d said Mr Simmons, her former communications director. \u201cThat will help tie together all of the strands of her policy and political life that will make sense for people.\u201d But over the course of four days, Ms Harris will need to sharpen her messaging around crime, inflation, the economy and immigration \u2013 issues the Trump campaign will relentlessly target between now and election day. Whit Ayres, a longtime Republican strategist, said Ms Harris will also at some point have to clarify the left-leaning positions she took in 2019 during her failed presidential bid. \"Her greatest vulnerability is that there is plenty of evidence that she's a San Francisco liberal with a whole set of far left wing policy positions that are outside the mainstream of American thinking, and she hasn't had to answer for those yet,\" he said.",

        "text": "CBS News poll: Gender gap, enthusiasm, economy make for tight Harris-Trump race on Democratic convention eve\nWhen Kamala Harris became the Democratic presidential nominee, the party saw a major surge in enthusiasm from its voters. It pulled the party into an effectively even race with Donald Trump and Republicans, and it has continued to motivate Democrats to vote today.\n\nShe and Trump are even across the battleground states that will decide the Electoral College, and now Harris has a 3-point edge nationally.\n\nThe late-changing campaign has also opened an historic dynamic, a race within the race to define both Harris and the key issues.\n\nTrump, for his part, keeps a lot of his advantages: he leads with people who say the economy is a major factor, and he leads with voters who say they aren't doing as well financially.\n\nYet voters tell us it's about more issues than that \u2014 abortion, the state of democracy, the border among them \u2014 and the contest is marked by a pronounced gender gap between men and women and very different views of which candidate would help them.\n\nHeading into the convention, many voters are still learning about Harris, creating a crucial test for the party this week. A third says they don't yet know what she stands for. Most voters think her views are similar \u2014 but not entirely the same \u2014 as Joe Biden's. And she's somewhat \u2014 but not entirely \u2014 seen as connected to Mr. Biden's economy.\n\nDemocrats have continued to close the gap with Republicans in expressing their intention to vote; today, they are effectively even with Republicans in saying so.\n\nBehind the gender-gap election\n\nThe gender gap has grown a little more and is approaching 2020 levels now. But it's more than a vote break. It underpins very different priorities and perceptions.\n\nFirst, women are more likely than men to see Harris as someone who \"fights for people like you\" a lot. And women are likelier to see Harris than Trump as fighting for people like them.\n\nSecond, views on gender equality efforts connect to voting.\n\nPeople who think efforts at promoting gender equality between men and women are going too far in America today are voting overwhelmingly for Trump. That's especially the case for men who think so.\n\nThose who think efforts to promote equally aren't going far enough or are about right are for Harris.\n\nThird, women help Harris on the economy more than they did Mr. Biden.\n\nThough still trailing Trump on the issue, Harris is doing 8 points better than Mr. Biden was in June among women who say the economy is a major factor for them. She's effectively even with Trump now among this group. She is also 7 points better from where Mr. Biden was in June among women who say inflation is a major factor.\n\nAbortion: Deja-vu from '22?\n\nFor rank-and-file Democrats, abortion and the state of democracy outpace the economy as major factors in their vote.\n\nPro-abortion rights voters may feel even better about Harris than about Mr. Biden, at least in terms of vote. She gets a higher vote share than he was getting among women who want abortion to be legal.\n\nAnd 71% of voters think Harris will try to pass a national law protecting abortion.\n\nThree-quarters of voters want mifepristone available. Nine in 10 believe Harris would make or keep it so, while seven in 10 say Trump will try to restrict access to it.\n\nBut Democrats are far more likely than independents or Republicans to call abortion a major factor.\n\nFewer voters overall say abortion is a \"major factor\" in their vote than say the economy is.\n\nSo a key metric to watch in this campaign is whether that view expands more beyond the party's ranks.\n\nThe race to define Harris (And how much separation from Biden does she need?)\n\nPeople know Trump, agree with him or not. Nearly nine in 10 voters say they know what he stands for.\n\nBut it's a little less so for Harris, as she's just become the nominee. Around a third say they don't know what she stands for yet.\n\nThis adds another key to watch at the convention as Democrats try to define her message before the Trump campaign does.\n\nPeople who think her policy views are entirely the same as Mr. Biden's, who are mostly Republicans, are voting for Trump.\n\nBut Harris does better among voters who think her views are mostly but not entirely the same as Mr. Biden's. This clearly goes for Democrats, but it goes for independents too.\n\nHow tied is she to Biden's economy?\n\nThe economy has long been seen as bad, but Harris' role as vice president is only somewhat tied to it.\n\nMost voters across party lines say Harris' decisions as vice president have impacted the U.S. economy at least some, but few say they have had \"a lot\" of impact.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump leads in perceptions of being able to make food and grocery prices go down. This was measured largely prior to Harris laying out inflation plans in a Friday speech. However that sentiment looks to be driven more by general confidence than by any particular policy.\n\nWhen we follow up with voters who think Trump winning means lower grocery prices for them and ask why, most say it's mainly because of a \"general confidence\" they have in Trump rather than specific policies they've heard him propose.\n\nWhether Trump can keep or expand that gap, or Harris can start to close it, could be another key item to watch at the convention and in the coming weeks.\n\nHow tied is she to the border?\n\nTrump remains overwhelmingly seen by voters as having policies that would reduce border crossings.\n\nTrump also leads among those who say the border is a major factor in their vote. In fact it is the largest lead he has among any issue group, even higher than inflation. (That's partially because Republicans overwhelmingly call it a factor.)\n\nHarris is somewhat, but not entirely, tied to U.S. border policy: a third think her decisions as vice president had \"a lot\" to do with the current situation. While this is largely driven by Republicans, this is higher than the number of voters that connect her decisions as vice president to the economy.\n\nBut border crossing attempts are reportedly down, and the percentage of voters calling the border a crisis, while still high, is down slightly from the spring.\n\nFor all that, so much of this contest is already locked in. Very few voters express openness to considering another candidate \u2014 more evidence this will probably be decided by turnout.\n\nSo, for Democrats, the convention will in part be about maintaining that enthusiasm among the base.\n\nUpdated state-level estimates from CBS News' statistical model show close races in all seven battlegrounds \u2014 they are all well within the margin of error, with both Harris and Trump in position to win if the election were today.\n\nHere's how the issues shape up relating to vote choice. Voters can identify multiple items as factors in their decision.\n\nAnd that all leads into the Democrats' convention as a guide to what to watch, as they \u2014 and Republicans countering it \u2014 compete in the contest within the contest to define what 2024 will ultimately be about.\n\nThis CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a representative sample of 3,258 registered voters nationwide interviewed between August 14-16, 2024. The sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, and education based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and the U.S. Census Current Population Survey, as well as past vote. Respondents were selected to be representative of registered voters nationwide. The margin of error for registered voters is \u00b12.1 points.\n\nBattlegrounds are AZ, GA, MI, NC, NV, PA, and WI.\n\n",

Opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado joined thousands of protesters in the capital, Caracas, and urged them not to be afraid. Ms Machado, who had been in hiding after being accused of insurrection, said there was nothing above the voice of the people, and that the people had spoken. Police and the army were deployed in force as supporters of Mr Maduro also held a demonstration.\n\n\"We won't leave the streets,\" Ms Machado told protesters, with many of them waving copies of election records from their voting stations as proof of victory. Ms Machado, who was banned from running in the election, had called for nationwide protests to intensify pressure on Mr Maduro to concede. Some demonstrators seemed determined to carry on. \"This is a criminal government that wants to hold on to power. I smell freedom, I have nothing to fear,\" said Adriana Calzadilla, quoted by AFP news agency. \u201cI hope for Maduro to recognise his defeat and hand over the power peacefully,\" medical student Jos\u00e9 Berbin told Reuters. \"What I think will happen is that the dictatorship will get harder, we all need to unite against the dictatorship and show that good people are more.\u201d Mr Maduro has insisted he won a third six-year term, but the opposition released tallies it said showed its candidate, Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez, winning by a wide margin. Speaking from an unidentified location, Mr Gonz\u00e1lez said it was time for an \"orderly transition\". At his rival rally, Mr Maduro mocked Mr Gonz\u00e1lez, saying he was \"living in a cave\". The electoral commission, controlled by allies of Mr Maduro, has refused to release detailed results, but declared he won with 52% of the vote. Independent observers said it lacked transparency.\n\nReuters Thousands of supporters of Mr Maduro also gathered in the capital and other cities",

So the plan\u2019s been in place for a year and a quarter now already. We\u2019re going to execute on that plan the next four days.\u201d\n\nShow more",

        "text": "U.S. intelligence officials warn of Iran's attempts to interfere in presidential election\nWhat we know about Iran hacking targeting 2024 presidential campaigns, election\n\nWashington \u2014 Iran's efforts to interfere with the 2024 presidential election are growing more aggressive as they target political campaigns \u2014 including GOP nominee Donald Trump's \u2014 and the American public with cyber and influence operations, three federal intelligence agencies said in a warning issued Monday.\n\nThe rare joint statement from the FBI, Office of the Director of National Intelligence and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) said the measures Iran is taking to \"stoke discord and undermine confidence in our democratic institutions\" have increased because the nation's government \"perceives this year's elections to be particularly consequential\" for its domestic policies.\n\nIntelligence officials for the first time publicly blamed Iran-backed hackers for the targeting of the Trump campaign, which revealed last week that it had been hacked and blamed Iranian actors for stealing and distributing sensitive internal documents.\n\nThree sources familiar with the investigation confirmed to CBS News that federal investigators suspected Iranian hackers targeted individuals associated with the Trump and Biden-Harris campaigns. The FBI launched the probes in the early summer after both presidential campaigns experienced attempted phishing schemes targeting campaign staff, the sources said.\n\nAccording to Monday's statement, the intelligence community said it is \"confident that the Iranians have through social engineering and other efforts sought access to individuals with direct access to the Presidential campaigns of both political parties.\"\n\n\"Such activity, including thefts and disclosures, are intended to influence the U.S. election process,\" the statement said.\n\nA senior official with the Harris campaign said last week, \"We are not aware of any security breaches of our systems.\"\n\nThe Permanent Mission of the Islamic Republic of Iran to the U.N. denied the intelligence community's accusations.\n\n\"Such allegations are unsubstantiated and devoid of any standing,\" the Iranian mission said in a statement Monday. \"As we have previously announced, the Islamic Republic of Iran harbors neither the intention nor the motive to interfere with the U.S. presidential election. Should the U.S. government genuinely believe in the validity of its claims, it should furnish us with the pertinent evidence\u2014if any\u2014to which we will respond accordingly.\"\n\nU.S. officials including the director of national intelligence and the heads of the FBI and CISA have warned of campaigns by foreign adversaries to undermine American elections, and Monday's statement makes clear the approach Iran is taking \"is not new.\"\n\nIn the runup to the 2020 presidential election, FBI Director Christopher Wray and then-Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe said Iran was working to \"damage\" Donald Trump's reelection efforts. And during the 2016 presidential race, Russian hackers stole and disseminated the emails of then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.\n\n\"This activity demonstrates the Iranians' increased intent to exploit our online platforms in support of their objectives,\" the officials warned Monday.\n\nThe FBI and CISA said last week that they \"have no reporting to suggest cyber activity, to include ransomware, has ever prevented a registered voter from casting a ballot, compromised the integrity of any ballots cast, or affected the accuracy of vote tabulation or voter registration information.\"\n\n\"While ransomware attacks against state or local government networks or election infrastructure could cause localized delays, they will not compromise the security or accuracy of vote casting or counting processes,\" they said.\n\ncontributed to this report.",

Iranian officials denied it.\n\nThe FBI and other federal agencies said in a joint statement that Iran had chosen to interfere in the US election \"to stoke discord and undermine confidence in our democratic institutions\".\n\nIran was behind the recent hack of Donald Trump's presidential campaign, US intelligence officials have confirmed.\n\n\u201cThe [intelligence community] is confident that the Iranians have through social engineering and other efforts sought access to individuals with direct access to the Presidential campaigns of both political parties,\u201d US intelligence officials said in the statement.\n\n\"Such activity, including thefts and disclosures, are intended to influence the US election process.\"\n\nThe Trump campaign was reportedly sent a spear-phishing email \u2013 a message designed to look trustworthy in order to get the target to click on a malicious link.\n\nThe Harris campaign said last week it had also been the target of a spear-phishing attack, though it was unsuccessful.\n\nThe agencies that released Monday's statement, including the FBI, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said the tactics were \"not new\" and noted that Russia and Iran had employed such methods during previous US elections.\n\nIt remains unclear what information, if any, was stolen during the hack. Trump said the hackers were only able to obtain publicly available information.\n\nThe New York Times, Politico and The Washington Post said they were leaked confidential information from inside the Trump campaign, including on its vetting of his running mate, JD Vance. The outlets have so far declined to offer specifics.\n\nUS officials said it was clear Iran wanted to shape the outcome of elections it believes are \"particularly consequential in terms of the impact they could have on its national security interests\".\n\nThe American intelligence agencies added that they had \"observed increasingly aggressive Iranian activity during this election cycle\".\n\nThere has been growing concern about potential Iranian hackers.\n\nRecently, Microsoft said it had seen \"the emergence of significant influence activity\" by groups linked to Iran.\n\nBefore he dropped out of the White House race last month, President Joe Biden's campaign was targeted by Iranian hackers, as was Trump's, according to Google.",

        "text": "Why CBC News follows the U.S. presidential election\nWe use this editor's blog to explain our journalism and what's happening at CBC News. You can find more blogs here .\n\nWe are just over two months from the U.S. presidential election and the culmination of a contest that appeared to turn upside down in the space of a few weeks this summer.\n\nFirst, there was the attempted assassination attempt on Donald Trump followed just a few days later by his triumphant nomination at the Republican National Convention. Within a week, Joe Biden had succumbed to pressure within his own party to drop out, setting up Kamala Harris for a quick acclamation as the Democratic nominee and renewed vigour to the Democratic presidential campaign.\n\nOur journalists in CBC's Washington bureau have seen a lot over the last decade, and even their heads were spinning by the pace and scale of these developments!\n\nWith the start of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago and the first debate between Trump and Harris scheduled for Sept. 10, I can say three things with certainty:\n\nThere will be no shortage of news from the campaign and we will be there to report it, including robust election night coverage through to inauguration.\n\nA large number of Canadians care about the race and are tuning in, driving up ratings and pageviews for CBC, but also for the big American news outlets available in Canada.\n\nCBC News will get complaints from members of our audience who question why we give a U.S. election so much time and focus.\n\nIt's that last bullet point I want to address.\n\nIt goes without saying that the overwhelming majority of our journalism each day remains dedicated to local and national news (as evidenced when you scroll through the 30-plus pages under CBCNews.ca , including our 20 regional news sites).\n\nAt the same time, world coverage has been a hallmark of CBC News since the public broadcaster was founded, and we dedicate more resources to international reporting than any other media outlet in Canada.\n\nWithin our coverage of the world, the United States occupies a special place for some obvious reasons. From arts and culture, national security, the economy to the environment \u2014 our countries are inextricably linked.\n\nWe share the longest international border in the world, with two-thirds of Canadians living within 100 kilometres of it. More than three quarters of our total exports travel over that border each year, along with $3 billion worth of trade and 400,000 people each day .\n\nThere are more Canadian citizens living in the United States \u2014 about 800,000 \u2014 than in any other country in the world.\n\nWe share continental and transatlantic defence obligations , intelligence strategy and environmental policy . American tech giants dominate the platforms and information ecosystems that Canadians use to make, share and consume content. (And by the way, we consume a lot of American culture, with U.S.-made movies , programs , video games and music commanding the lion's share of our discretionary attention and dollars.)\n\nSimply put, the United States and the policies of its government have a direct and daily impact on the lives of most Canadians. It can easily be argued that the U.S. presidential election matters more to Canadians than any other election beyond our own.\n\nAnd yet, it is not OUR election, which gives CBC News the unique ability to zoom out from the daily horse race, watch from a distance and provide you with an outsider's perspective and the Canadian context you won't find in U.S. media coverage.\n\nWe are at our best when we cover this race through a Canadian lens and zero-in on what matters to us and our country. We pledge to do this while balancing the demands of the daily news cycle and coverage of the latest developments.",

        "text": "National Poll of Latino Voters by Hispanic Federation, Latino Victory Foundation Finds Latinos Have a Renewed Enthusiasm to Vote in the Presidential Election\nNational Poll of Latino Voters by Hispanic Federation, Latino Victory Foundation Finds Latinos Have a Renewed Enthusiasm to Vote in the Presidential Election\n\nNational snapshot poll reveals that Vice President Harris\u2019 emergence has generated enthusiasm across key segments of the Latino electorate, with new excitement especially evident for women, younger, and more Spanish-speaking Latinos\n\nLink to the Livestream Here\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 As the Democratic National Convention kicks off in Chicago on August 19th, two of the nation\u2019s premier Latino organizations, Hispanic Federation and Latino Victory Foundation, unveiled the results of a new national snap poll of registered Latino voters. The poll revealed that the Latino electorate is highly motivated to participate in the 2024 elections, paying attention to the policy positions championed by candidates, and positioned to play a decisive role in key battleground states.\n\nResults from the poll, which BSP Research conducted from August 6-10, show that there is renewed enthusiasm within the Latino electorate, \u2013 with a striking 57% of respondents replying that they are more interested in voting due to Vice President Harris entering the presidential election. The poll also found that economic issues were top of mind for Latino voters with respondents choosing cost of living/inflation (60%), jobs and the economy (38%), and housing costs (29%) as the most important issues for elected officials to address.\n\nThe Latino electorate is the second largest voting bloc in the United States and continues to experience historic growth with Latinos projected to account for nearly 15% of all eligible voters in November 2024. An estimated 36.2 million Latinos are eligible to vote this year, up from 32.3 million in 2020 \u2013 and of Latino voters, about 25% will be voting for the very first time.\n\nAs organizations with decades of experience in mobilizing Latino voters and building greater Latino power and representation nationwide, Hispanic Federation and Latino Victory Foundation, partnered in this poll to highlight the need for candidates to engage with and understand the needs and aspirations of Latino voters.\n\n\u201cThe findings of our poll confirm what we have been saying all along: Latino voters are paying attention and will be the deciding factor in the 2024 election. However, the poll also reveals that there is still a lot of work to do around Latino outreach and engagement, and the candidates must do more to engage Latinos on the issues that resonate with them. Latinos want to hear about their plans to create economic opportunities, address the need for humane immigration policies, confront gun violence, and protect reproductive rights,\u201d said Frankie Miranda, President and CEO of the Hispanic Federation. \u201cHF will continue to work with our partner network of 750 Latino community-based organizations to provide nonpartisan information, mobilize our community to the polls, and ensure that the voices of the 64 million Latinos living in the U.S. are heard in 2024 and beyond.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis new poll supports what we at Latino Victory and Hispanic Federation have long known: Latinos are not a monolithic group, particularly when it comes to voting,\u201d said Luis A. Miranda, Jr., Chair of Latino Victory. \u201cHarris\u2019s candidacy is supported by more Puerto Rican voters than by Mexican Americans and other Latino voting groups. There is also a considerable gender gap among Latinos and Latinas, despite Harris winning over both men and women overall \u2013 35% of Latino men support Trump while only 23% of Latinas support his candidacy. The parties still have a lot of work to do to solidify the Latino vote for their respective candidate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that Vice President Harris has injected considerable enthusiasm into the presidential contest and this poll confirms what is being reported on the ground and with huge crowds at Harris rallies, that is, Latino voters report high levels of favorability and trust in Kamala Harris to tackle the issues important to the Latino community,\u201d said Matt Barreto, Founding Partner and President, BSP Research.\n\n\u201cLatino voters will be a deciding factor in this election,\u201d said Sindy Benavides, President and CEO of Latino Victory Foundation. \u201cTheir renewed enthusiasm to vote after Vice President Harris entered the election is a welcome sign of the times, but organizations like Latino Victory and Hispanic Federation know too well that Latino voters are persuasion voters. Candidates and organizations must invest to ramp up voter engagement among this powerhouse community. We\u2019re thrilled to see Latinos are enthusiastic about voting in this high-stakes election, but this only means we have our work cut out to ensure this enthusiasm translates into actual votes \u2013 and we\u2019re ready for the challenge!\u201d\n\nKey takeaways from the poll include:\n\n73% of registered Latino voters are almost certain they will vote in the 2024 Presidential election\n\nHarris emergence has generated enthusiasm across key segments that Democrats will need to consolidate, with 57% of respondents replying that they are more interested in voting due to Vice President Harris entering the presidential election\n\nNew excitement is especially true for women, younger, and more Spanish speaking Latinos\n\nInflation and cost of living remain the top issue by a large margin: 60% cited as top issue\n\nJobs (38%) and housing costs and affordability (29%), rank high after inflation\n\nOutside of economic concerns, immigration issues (21%) and reform (20%), gun violence (20%), and abortion rights (18%) are the top cited concerns\n\nThe majority of Latino voters do not feel well informed on candidates\u2019 policy proposals and platforms\n\nIn a combined 2-way vote, Harris led former President Donald Trump by 24 points, 59% to 35% among registered Latino voters\n\nThe snapshot poll is just the beginning. The partners intend to conduct additional polling throughout the election cycle to reveal additional insights about this key growing voter bloc and develop nonpartisan get out the vote culturally competent messaging that is tailored to specific local communities.\n\nBSP collected 600 interviews with registered Latino voters of all backgrounds from across the country, with a nominal margin of error of +/- 4.0%. The poll fielded from August 6-9, with a sample size of 600 voters, reached by cell phone, email invite, or online voter panels.\n\nDownload a PDF of the poll results here.\n\n###\n\nAbout Hispanic Federation:\n\nHispanic Federation (HF) is a nonprofit membership and advocacy organization, founded in 1990, committed to empowering and advancing the Hispanic community, with a focus on low-income, marginalized and immigrant Latinos.

        "text": "A brief history of presidential candidate debates\nDebates between presidential candidates have become an important part of the election process every four years, but in historical terms, these events are relatively new.\n\nThe first widely seen debates between presidential nominees were held in 1960 when John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon squared off on television four times. It took another 16 years for the practice to resume when Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford debated at the Walnut Street Theater in Philadelphia.\n\nSince then, nominated major party presidential candidates have debated on live television and other media formats every four years. This year, the second 2024 presidential debate, between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, will be held at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, on Sept. 10, 2024.\n\nThat event is widely expected to have a large national viewing audience. In a 2016 Pew Research Center survey, about 63 percent of prospective voters felt the presidential debates were helpful in deciding which candidate to vote for. The Center said those numbers were similar to past survey results about the impact of the debates on voter decisions.\n\nThe Era Before Presidential Debates\n\nPolitical debates before the era of television did occur, and perhaps the most noteworthy was the series of public debates in 1858 between two future presidential candidates: Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas.\n\nDuring the seven Lincoln-Douglas debates for a U.S. Senate seat in Illinois, the first speaker talked for one hour, followed by a 90-minute rebuttal from the second speaker, and a 30-minute closing statement from the first speaker. Some of the Lincoln-Douglas debates had more than 10,000 people in the audience, as the two men argued their positions.\n\nIn the 1920s, the advent of radio made political debates broadcast to the masses a real possibility, but the prospect was controversial. Congress passed the Communications Act of 1934; its Section 315 required that broadcasters who allowed political candidates to speak give an equal amount of speaking time to all of their legally qualified opponents, including minor-party candidates. The equal time rule inhibited debates with more than two candidates until 1976, with some exceptions. Congress could suspend the Section 315 requirement if asked by the candidates.\n\nIn 1940, Republican presidential candidate Wendell Willkie challenged his opponent, incumbent President Franklin D. Roosevelt, to several radio debates. Roosevelt declined the offers, citing scheduling conflicts or his need to concentrate on his presidential role as World War II unfolded. In 1948, Republican primary candidates Thomas Dewey and Harold Stassen took part in a radio debate during the Oregon primary. The Dewey-Stassen contest was limited to one question: Should the Communist Party be outlawed in the United States?\n\nIn 1956, Democratic contenders Adlai Stevenson and Estes Kefauver debated on live television during the Florida primary. And during the general election, two proxies for Stevenson and President Dwight Eisenhower took part in a live edition of the television show \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d Eleanor Roosevelt advocated for Stevenson as president and Sen. Margaret Chase Smith argued the case of the Eisenhower campaign.\n\nIn 1960, Congress waived Section 315 to allow the first national broadcast debates between two major party nominees: John F. Kennedy and Vice President Richard Nixon. The four televised debates became the templates for future presidential debates, and they showcased the power of television to influence elections.\n\nThe Kennedy-Nixon debates were watched live by as many as 70 million Americans. They also gave many potential voters their first chance to see actual presidential candidates in a live environment, as potential leaders.\n\nIn 1975, the Federal Communications Commission ruled that public debates that were broadcast in full, and not sponsored by the candidates or their supporters, were exempt from the equal time rule as on-the-spot news coverage. The FCC\u2019s decision allowed for presidential debates that featured leading candidates as picked by the debate organizers, removing the logistical issues involved with many candidates on the debate floor.\n\nThe Modern Era of Presidential Debates\n\nUnder the new FCC rules, the League of Women Voters sponsored the presidential debates between 1976 and 1984. Incumbent President Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter agreed to three debates, and the vice presidential candidates also were scheduled for one debate. The only debate in 1980 between President Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan drew 80 million live viewers, which was the most-viewed event during the League of Women Voters era.\n\nIn 1987, the two parties agreed to support a bipartisan non-profit, the Commission on Presidential Debates, to organize and run debates between the leading candidates for president and vice president. The commission was funded by independent donors and not by political parties.\n\nIn 1992, the commission include a third candidate, Ross Perot, in its sponsored debates after Perot\u2019s strong performance in popular polling. However, in 1996, Perot and Dr. John Hagelin, the nominee of another third party, sued the commission when it excluded them from the general election debates after a rules change.\n\nIn Perot v. Federal Election Commission (1996), the U.S. District for the District of Columbia Appeals Court ruled against Perot and Hagelin. In a per curiam opinion, the three judges said the commission had the right to exclude other candidates it determined had no \u201crealistic chance of winning\u201d the 1996 election. It also upheld a lower court ruling that the commission was not a state actor and could not violate the candidates\u2019 First Amendment rights.\n\nDuring the commission\u2019s era, the presidential debates were conducted with live audiences. In recent years, the first Hillary Clinton-Donald Trump debate in 2016 drew 84 million viewers and first Joe Biden-Trump 2020 debate had 73 million viewers, according to the commission.\n\nIn 2024, the leading candidates, Biden and Trump, decided to bypass the commission as the debate organizers and work with selected television networks. The commission announced in June 2024 that it was officially cancelling four debates it had scheduled.\n\nOn June 27, 2024, Biden and Trump debated in an event in Atlanta sponsored by CNN with 51.3 million viewers. After that debate, Biden announced on July 21, 2004 that he was not running for re-election. The first debate between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris is scheduled for Sept. 10, 2024, at the National Constitution Center and is sponsored by ABC News. Also, the vice presidential candidates, JD Vance and Tim Walz, are scheduled to debate on CBS in New York City on Oct. 1, 2024. Other debates could be scheduled during the election cycle.\n\nScott Bomboy is the editor in chief of the National Constitution Center.",

Republican world as his allies including Florida Senator Rick Scott and his colleague in the House, Byron Donalds, are among those who will lead the GOP\u2019s efforts to counter-program the convention.\n\nThemes of the four-day event at the Trump hotel will include immigration, crime and the economy, and will mirror issues being spoken about at the DNC in order to drive home the Republican party\u2019s message.\n\nJohn Bowden reports:\n\nTrumpworld\u2019s DNC counter-programming plans revealed\n\nHarris campaign slams Trump for planning rally in Michigan town with long ties to KKK\n\nSunday 18 August 2024 23:00 , John Bowden\n\nKamala Harris\u2019s campaign has slammed Donald Trump for planning a rally in a Michigan town with long ties to the Ku Klux Klan and white supremacists.\n\nOn Saturday, a spokesperson for the Harris campaign savaged the Republican ticket\u2019s choice of venue arguing that Trump is making an appeal to the white nationalists who marched against Jews and other minorities in Charlottesville in 2017 \u2013 a moment which led to Trump controversially praising demonstrators and counterprotesters at a press conference.\n\n\u201cThe racists and white supremacists who marched in Trump\u2019s name last month in Howell have all watched him praise Hitler, defend neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, and tell far-right extremists to \u2018stand back and stand by.\u2019 Trump\u2019s actions have encouraged them, and Michiganders can expect more of the same when he comes to town next week,\u201d the Michigan communications director for the Harris campaign, Alyssa Bradley, told The Washington Post.\n\nJohn Bowden reports:\n\nHarris campaign slams Trump for planning rally in Michigan town with long ties to KKK\n\nTim Walz posts selfie ahead of bus tour\n\nMonday 19 August 2024 00:00 , Ariana Baio\n\nTim Walz, the Democratic vice presidential candidate, shared two selfies of himself, his wife Gwen Walz, Vice President Kamala Harris and Second Gentleman Doug Emoff shortly before they boarded buses to take them around Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cRoad trip,\u201d Walz wrote in the caption of his post.\n\nHow Tim Walz gave his queer high school students a refuge\n\n01:00 , Alex Woodward\n\nA straight, football-coaching National Guardsman wasn\u2019t the LGBT+ ally that Seth Elliot Meyer expected.\n\nBut Meyer, who came out as queer in his freshman year of high school in 2000, admits he was wrong about Tim Walz.\n\n\u201cI just sort of naively believed that someone who was a big, masculine dude with a deep voice was never someone who\u2019s going to be on my side,\u201d Meyer says.\n\n\u201cAs much as those younger students who were courageous enough to be out in those years, it was just as important to have those very kind of \u2018normal,\u2019 strong, straight, masculine allies backing us up.\u201d\n\nBefore he was governor of Minnesota, before he was a member of Congress, and before he was a candidate for the next vice president of the United States, he was \u201cMr Walz,\u201d a geography teacher at Mankato West High School, roughly 80 miles south of Minneapolis.\n\nRead more from Alex Woodward here\n\nTrump obsesses over Harris\u2019s Time magazine cover declaring he\u2019s \u2018better looking\u2019 than her\n\n03:00 , Ariana Baio\n\nDuring his appearance in the crucial swing state, the former president dedicated some time to mocking Harris\u2019s Time magazine cover by insinuating the depiction made her look better.\n\nAriana Baio reports:\n\nTrump claims he\u2019s \u2018better looking\u2019 than Harris as he obsesses over Time cover again\n\nWho is on the DNC schedule?\n\n05:00 , Ariana Baio\n\nThe Democratic National Convention gets underway on Monday August 19 in Chicago, Illinois, with some political heavyweights slated to headline the four-day gathering.\n\nWhile the DNC is first and foremost a presidential nominating convention, Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate Tim Walz are already officially on the Democratic party\u2019s ticket after a five-day round of online voting from delegates wrapped on August 5.\n\nBut there were still be speeches from Democratic leaders like President Joe Biden, former president Barack Obama, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Jason Carter, the grandson of Jimmy Carter.\n\nFind out more about who is on the DNC schedule here\n\nTim Walz emphasizes unity in campaign stump speech\n\n07:00 , Ariana Baio\n\n\u201cThis campaign is a chance to bring out that joy, turn the page and look to the future,\u201d Minnesota Governor Tim Walz told supporters on Sunday in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn a short stump speech, Walz told young people that the Harris-Walz campaign is an opportunity to see the positive side of America and come together.\n\n\u201cSome of us who have less hair are old enough to remember when you could go to Thanksgiving to watch a Steelers game with your relatives and not complain about politics the whole time. We shared a commitment to democracy,\u201d Walz said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t call each other names, we don\u2019t do it. And we don\u2019t use the least fortunate among us as punchlines for jokes because they are our neighbors,\u201d he added.\n\nJD Vance compares Harris to Jeffrey Epstein and claims polls showing Trump losing are fake\n\n08:00 , John Bowden\n\nJD Vance likened Vice President Kamala Harris to pedophile Jeffrey Epstein in a wild interview on Sunday, where he also claimed that polls showing him and Donald Trump losing are \u201cfake\u201d.\n\nJohn Bowden reports:\n\nJD Vance wildly compares Kamala Harris to Jeffrey Epstein",

        "text": "How Russian gender-based disinformation could influence the 2024 U.S. presidential election\nMost people have a general understanding of disinformation \u2014 false information that is intentionally created to cause harm. Disinformation becomes \u201cgendered\u201d when deliberately false information draws on common understandings of issues like masculinity, femininity and sexual violence.\n\nAlthough gender-based disinformation does not receive as much attention as race-based disinformation, it\u2019s particularly dangerous because it taps into deep-seated beliefs about our own identities.\n\nNarratives about gender identity are also harder to fact-check than simple true or false stories.\n\nAs the Democratic Convention gets underway in Chicago, Vice President Kamala Harris is increasingly vulnerable to gender-based disinformation campaigns \u2014 if she isn\u2019t already a victim of them.\n\nRussian gender-based disinformation\n\nScholars have long understood that women politicians regularly experience misogynistic comments, but gender-based disinformation is insidious in other ways.\n\nStates like Russia target the citizens of western countries with gender-based disinformation to promote their foreign policy goals.\n\nWhen Canada assumed leadership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\u2019s (NATO) battle group in Latvia, Russia spread gender-based disinformation to Latvian Russian-speakers to undermine local support for Canada\u2019s mission. These campaigns claimed that the Canadian Armed Forces were filled with homosexuals and potential rapists. The core message was that Latvians should not trust Canadians.\n\nRecent studies have also found that Russia strategically uses bots and trolls to spread false stories about female politicians to influence public opinion before elections. If a male candidate aligns more closely with Russia\u2019s foreign policy goals, it may use gendered narratives to discredit that candidate\u2019s female opponent.\n\nThis type of gender-based disinformation often inflates the credibility of male candidates by portraying women as being unqualified, overly emotional, prone to lying and unintelligent.\n\nThese disinformation campaigns use cutting-edge technology to convey the right narratives to the right people. During its interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Russia used data crumbs commonly employed by internet marketers to \u201cmicro-target\u201d social media users with select disinformation based on their specific psychological and socioeconomic markers, as well as their political beliefs.\n\nThe 2024 election campaign\n\nAmericans should be aware of an onslaught of gender-based disinformation about Harris that will likely gain momentum after this week\u2019s Democratic National Convention.\n\nWhen Hillary Clinton ran for office in 2016, little was known about gender-based disinformation. Now that authorities know and understand the disinformation tactics used during that election, Americans can prepare for the ballot box with the lessons learned from history.\n\nThere are two disinformation tactics favoured by Russia and used in 2016 that it will likely use again in 2024.\n\nOne is to portray a candidate as inauthentic or hypocritical.\n\nClinton was the first female nominee of a major party and had the potential to mobilize female voters. To undermine domestic support for Clinton, Russia spread news stories that suggested that even though she was a woman, her policies belie the feminist cause, implying that real feminists should not support her.\n\nDuring the 2020 U.S. presidential election, Harris was similarly targeted with disinformation after Biden announced her as his running mate. There were claims that she did not deserve to be vice president because she was merely a diversity hire and had used sex to gain power. Those claims have been repeated since she became the party\u2019s presidential candidate.\n\nSegmentation is the second Russian tactic. It entails polarizing society and fragmenting groups at the same time. Research shows that one of the primary goals of state-sponsored disinformation campaigns is to break apart the social fabric of a country by amplifying social, cultural and political fault lines.\n\nAhead of the 2016 presidential election, one study found that Russian-backed accounts on Twitter (now X) spread narratives attacking feminists, claiming that they were \u201cman-hating\u201d ideologues who sought to suppress men\u2019s rights. Polarizing narratives like this were designed to create divisions between feminists and non-feminists.\n\nAt the same time, Russia sought to fragment the feminist movement. Accounts linked to Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency posed as feminists on Twitter to critique other feminists, claiming that feminism was too white to represent black feminists or too liberal to represent conservative feminists. Although these may be valid critiques of the feminist movement, Russia instrumentally used them to divide voters who might have come together to support Clinton.\n\nBaseless attacks on Harris\n\nAlthough links to states like Russia are unclear, the media environment is already filled with gender-based disinformation about Harris.\n\nA recent study found that among 130,000 public posts on X, Instagram and TikTok, 15 per cent of them erroneously claimed that Joe Biden called Harris a \u201cdiversity hire,\u201d seven per cent highlighted a video of a television judge slandering her, and three per cent made scurrilous and false allegations about her sexual history. X owner Elon Musk even circulated a deep fake video of Harris confirming that Biden selected her because she is a Black woman \u2014 the \u201cultimate diversity hire.\u201d\n\nGender-based disinformation is already part of the presidential election. Voters need to know that they are exposed to false information, and that it\u2019s not benign. It is often constructed by states like Russia to influence elections and undermine America\u2019s social cohesion.\n\nOwen Wong, Researcher at the Centre for International and Defence Policy, Queen's University, Ontario\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

        "text": "AARP Election Polls Examine Races Across the U.S.\nAs candidates take their messages to voters, AARP has commissioned a series of exclusive polls focusing on presidential swing states and states with tight races to gauge voters\u2019 preferences and the issues that influence them.\n\nThese polls target voters of all ages and break out data on voters 50-plus. That group of older adults is likely to have an outsize influence on the outcome of the 2024 election because of its large numbers and dedication to turning out to vote.\n\nMembers only\n\n\u201cVoters over the age of 50 have historically been the deciders of the winners in the last several elections; in 2020 and 2022, they made up 55 percent and 65 percent of the electorate, respectively,\u201d says Khelan Bhatia, AARP\u2019s director of voter engagement. \u201cOur 2024 battleground state polls show that they\u2019re more motivated to vote than younger voters, which means they\u2019re likely going to be the deciders again in this year\u2019s election.\u201d\n\nThe AARP polls take a close look at matchups between the Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, and the Republican, former President Donald Trump. To date, the two candidates are often nearly tied in head-to-head matchups in many states. Voters also are asked about their preferences among Harris, Trump and third-party presidential candidates, and voters weigh in on some congressional and U.S. Senate races.\n\nIssues that matter in elections\n\nThe surveys, done by the bipartisan polling team of Fabrizio Ward and Impact Research, ask voters about their top issues. To date, immigration and border security; inflation and rising prices; the economy and jobs; threats to democracy; and reproductive issues have risen to the top in many states. Pollsters also queried voters on how important Social Security, Medicare, family caregiving, and the cost of prescription drugs, housing and utilities are in deciding their vote.\n\nHow to vote in your state Learn more about absentee and early voting, ID requirements and registration in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nVoters weigh in on the stances that would make them more likely to cast a ballot for a particular candidate: making sure workers get the Social Security they paid into the program, for example, or advocating for tax credits for unpaid family caregivers to help cover costs.\n\nCaregiving is also a focus of the AARP surveys, which ask voters how many hours per week they care for an older or ill adult or someone with a disability. Many voters reported spending a significant amount of time in a caregiving roll.\n\n\u201cIf candidates hope to win, they have to pay attention to [the concerns of older adults] like keeping Social Security strong and helping family caregivers take care of their loved ones,\u201d Bhatia says.\n\nData collected by the pollsters provides insight into the mechanics of how voters plan to cast their ballots this election season, whether that\u2019s early and in person before Election Day, by absentee or mail-in ballot, or by heading to the polls on Nov. 5.\n\nVoters also weigh in on how motivated they are to vote, whether they have favorable or unfavorable opinions of the candidates, and if they think the country is headed in the right or the wrong direction. Voters are also asked specific questions related to issues in their states.\n\nCheck our list of polls to find how voters across the country are leaning in the general election.",

        "text": "Barack and Michelle Obama electrify Democrats but warn of tight race\nBarack and Michelle Obama electrify Democrats but warn of tight race\n\nMichelle Obama mentions Donald Trump's 'black job' comment\n\nMichelle and Barack Obama gave resounding endorsements of Kamala Harris on Tuesday night at the Democratic National Convention, exhorting party supporters across the US to turn out and vote to defeat Donald Trump in November. \"Hope is making a comeback,\" Mrs Obama told the crowd at the DNC in Chicago, echoing her husband's campaign promise of \"hope and change\". In their back-to-back speeches, the Democratic Party's most popular figures praised Ms Harris, while excoriating Trump - whose presidency was characterised by \"bluster and chaos\", in the words of Mr Obama. But the couple also warned their party not to lose sight of what remains an extremely tight race amid the enthusiasm for Ms Harris's campaign. They stressed the election would be decided in a handful of key swing states.\n\n\"Make no mistake, it will be a fight,\u201d said the 63-year-old former president Mr Obama. Michelle Obama, 60, stressed the point further. \"We need to vote in numbers that erase any doubt,\" she said. \"We need to overwhelm any effort to suppress us.\" Mr Obama emphasised America's preparedness for a \"new chapter\", adding: \"We are ready for a President Kamala Harris. And Kamala Harris is ready for the job.\" The Obamas' appeal to Democrats to turn out in November exposed a deeper party anxiety about the narrow race between Ms Harris and Trump, who retains a tight hold on his loyal base of supporters across the country. Ms Harris has a slender lead in national polling averages but pollsters caution that the race remains a virtual tie in the handful of battleground states that will ultimately decide who wins under America's electoral college system. Though Ms Harris is technically the incumbent candidate, she has described herself and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, as the underdogs in the race. A simple guide to the US presidential election\n\nThe swing states set to decide the presidency in 2024 The Obamas also acknowledged the renewed sense of excitement within the party since Ms Harris replaced President Joe Biden following his exit from the race - making a tacit reference to the enthusiasm and message of hope that powered Mr Obama to victory in his 2008 presidential run against Republican John McCain. Mr Obama also went on to serve a second term, before Trump won the White House in 2016.\n\nDNC: Obamas captivate Democrat convention and endorse Kamala Harris\n\nMrs Obama, whose most memorable line from her last convention speech in 2016 was, \"when they go low, we go high\", did little to lower the temperature of the heated political rhetoric that has divided the country over the last decade. She attacked Trump for assailing her family and continuing to push \"ugly, misogynistic, racist lies as a substitute for real ideas and solutions that will actually make people's lives better\". In a broadside that generated some of the loudest cheers of the night, she mocked Trump for his use of the term \"black jobs\" on the campaign trail. \"Who\u2019s going to tell him that the job he\u2019s currently seeking might just be one of those black jobs?\" she said, referring to her husband's presidency. Mrs Obama also used her platform to remember her late mother, Chicago-raised Marian Robinson, who died earlier this year aged 86. \"I wasn't even sure if I could be steady enough to stand before you tonight, but my heart compelled me to,\" she told the audience.\n\n'This will still be a tight race' - Barack Obama\n\nVance and Harris host competing events\n\nTrump and running mate JD Vance have been holding rallies and events in swing states while the Democrats gather in Chicago. On Tuesday afternoon, Mr Vance used a news conference in neighbouring Wisconsin to attack Ms Harris over the \"failures\" of her vice-presidency. He zeroed in on crime and public safety, and the economy - two areas where the Republicans see a vulnerability. Referring to protests in the city of Kenosha after the police shooting of black man Jacob Blake in 2020, he said: \"Wisconsin has suffered when you don't have good, smart, pro-public safety and leadership, and that\u2019s what Donald Trump and I want to bring back to the White House.\u201d\n\nReuters\n\nHaving travelled to Wisconsin, Ms Harris was not present at day two of the convention in Chicago. But the event did feature a jubilant and star-studded roll call, with delegates from each state - as well as US territories - symbolically casting a vote for Ms Harris and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz in the arena. Though the vice-president formally clinched her party\u2019s nomination earlier this month, the symbolic gesture quickly turned into a dance party. Lil Jon performed Turn Down For What before Georgia\u2019s announced its vote. Actor Sean Astin spoke during Indiana\u2019s turn, a nod to his role in the cult classic American football film Rudy, which is set in the state. An on-stage DJ spun songs for each state as delegates, on their feet and wearing bracelets that flashed red and white, delivered short speeches about why they were supporting Ms Harris and Mr Walz. BBC Verify: Six Kamala Harris claims fact-checked The vice-president then virtually addressed the crowd from her rally in Milwaukee - 90 miles away - at the same venue where Trump accepted his party's nomination four weeks ago. \"We are so honoured to be your nominees,\" she said of herself and Mr Walz. \"I'll see you in two days, Chicago.\"\n\nDoug Emhoff takes the stage\n\n'Hey, it's Doug!' - Kamala Harris's husband on how they met\n\nBefore the Obamas gave their speeches, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, Ms Harris's husband, made his own appearance to share personal stories about the vice-president - including how they were set up on a blind date by one of his clients in 2013. He spoke about their \"big, beautiful, blended family\", referring to his son, Cole, and daughter, Ella, from his first marriage. He described Ms Harris as a \"joyful warrior\" and a supportive parent who put their family first despite the demands of her job. Doug Emhoff could become the first US First Gentleman Ms Harris, who was flying back from her rally during her husband's speech, kept Air Force Two in the air so she could watch his speech live, the White House said. Mr Emhoff said the two would celebrate their 10th anniversary on Thursday night, when Ms Harris formally accepts the party's nomination in a primetime speech. \"Kamala was exactly the right person for me at an important moment in my life,\" he said. \"And at this moment in our nation's history, she is exactly the right president.\"",

        "text": "Guide to the 2024 Presidential Candidates\u2019 Policy Proposals \u2014 Penn Wharton Budget Model\nHarris Campaign Policy Proposals: PWBM estimates that the Harris Campaign tax and spending proposals would increase primary deficits by $1.2 trillion over the next 10 years on a conventional basis and by $2.0 trillion on a dynamic basis that includes a reduction in economic activity. Lower and middle-income households generally benefit from increased transfers and credits on a conventional basis, while higher-income households are worse off.\n\nPotential Harris Campaign Proposals for the Top Rate on Capital Gains: In recent campaign speeches, Vice President Kamala Harris has spoken about raising the top marginal rate on long-term capital gains. Official campaign sources have yet to release sufficient details about the proposal to model it fairly and effectively. However, reporting on the proposal suggests that the yet-to-be-detailed plan would add a new top rate for long-term capital gains, taxing them at 28% for filers with more than $1 million of income. Reporting also indicates that the Harris campaign is in favor of raising the net investment income tax (NIIT) from 3.8% to 5% for filers with more than $1 million of income, this has also not yet been independently confirmed by official campaign sources. Together, these proposals would amount to an all-in marginal tax rate of 33% on long-term capital gains for high income filers. Notably, this is below the all-in 44.6% top marginal rate for capital income in President Biden\u2019s proposed 2025 budget.\n\nTable 1 shows conventional revenue estimates for these two new proposals. They are estimate as stacked after other policies that we already analyzed in our Harris Campaign analysis released on August 26, 2024. PWBM estimates that together these two new proposals alone would raise $143.6 billion over the 10-year budget window, which offsets some of the Harris campaign revenue losses that we previously estimated in our August 26 release. Relative to the Biden FY 2025 Budget, however, these two proposals would lose $308 billion over the 10-year window.\n\nFor more information:\n\nPotential Harris Campaign Proposals for the Top Rate on Capital Gains",

        "text": "CBS News 2024 presidential election analysis: How many voters are persuadable?\nWith a close contest between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, including very tight battleground races, just how much room is there for movement before the election? Campaign ads and voter contact efforts aim to reach voters who might be persuaded to change their minds in the coming weeks. So, just how many persuadable voters are out there?\n\nWhile the precise number depends on the exact definition of \"persuadable,\" it's a small sliver of the electorate any way you look at it. That's because partisan loyalty has been high in recent years. Routinely, over 90% of Democrats and Republicans vote for their party's nominee. And few voters change which party they support from election to election. For example, according to exit polling, only 4% of Hillary Clinton's 2016 voters switched to Trump in 2020, and the percentage of Trump 2016 voters crossing over to Joe Biden in 2020 was also in the single digits.\n\nRelatedly, we don't find many voters who say they're unsure of their vote choice, even several months before Election Day. Nor are there many backing candidates who say they would even consider someone else.\n\nThat said, even a tiny group can be decisive. The last two presidential elections were decided by fewer than five percentage points nationally, and more importantly, by mere fractions of a point in the pivotal states. That makes the small group of potentially persuadable voters worth analyzing. Let's put some more precise numbers on this group.\n\nUnder narrow definition, who might flip between Harris and Trump?\n\nOne sensible definition of a \"persuadable\" voter is someone who's open to switching their vote. Nationally, 7% of Harris voters say they at least might consider Trump. And 8% of Trump voters say so of Harris. (Most say \"Maybe, there's still time,\" as opposed to an outright \"Yes, I would.\")\n\nPutting these groups together, just 7% of all likely voters are persuadable \u2014 or \"flippable\" \u2014 under this definition. That doesn't mean they will flip, but they at least signal an openness to it.\n\nWhile we don't know who will flip when they cast an ballot, we can use survey data to get a sense of who's been oscillating between candidates this summer. We have surveyed about a thousand voters at least twice since Mr. Biden dropped out, typically more than 10 days apart. Only 2% of them switched from Harris to Trump or vice versa between interviews.\n\nA broader definition: Who's unsure or only leaning toward a candidate?\n\nA somewhat broader definition would also include voters who are not sure of their vote initially or only are leaning toward Harris or Trump. That's because even if they haven't flipped so far, they are less firm than voters who pick one of these candidates outright. (Voters who said they were initially unsure or voting third party were then asked whether they lean toward Harris or Trump.)\n\nUnder this definition, 12% are persuadable \u2014 that's about 1 in 8 likely voters nationwide. This measure is down slightly from July, when Biden was still in the race. And it's a bit lower than the number in competitive states when Mr. Biden and Trump ran four years ago. The 1-in-8 figure also applies in the battlegrounds \u2014 the most competitive states that will see the most campaign activity trying to convince voters this fall.\n\nWhat do persuadable voters look like?\n\nPersuadable voters, by either definition, are younger and more racially diverse. They tend to identify as politically independent, and they're somewhat likelier than other voters to use social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok for news.\n\nAnd importantly, pocketbook concerns may be more salient for them. They are more likely than firmly decided voters to say their vote will mostly be about their personal financial situation, as opposed to their rights and freedoms.\n\nThey also aren't as likely to have turned out in recent elections or say they will be voting this year. That means part of the challenge for campaigns is getting these voters to turn out, which often goes hand in hand with persuasion.\n\nAt the moment, they are roughly even on leaned vote, but Harris may have more room to grow: 7 in 10 say they might consider her if they aren't already, while only half say so of Trump. And while the vast majority say they know what Trump stands for, only half say so about Harris.\n\nHarris' advantage with this group also represents an improvement from July. Just before Mr. Biden dropped out, most persuadable voters said they would not consider him if they weren't already.\n\nIn fact, some Democratic leaning voters who were undecided last month when Mr. Biden was the presumptive nominee have already shifted to Harris. She is enjoying a higher \"floor\" of support than Mr. Biden did, with more Democratic voters now locked into their decision. Part of the reason there's been a decrease in the number of persuadable voters since a month ago is that Biden 2020 voters, including many independents, are more firmly behind Harris than they were Mr. Biden.\n\nThis analysis is primarily based on a CBS News/YouGov survey of 3,258 registered voters nationwide fielded August 14-16, 2024. The sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, and education based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and the U.S. Census Current Population Survey, as well as past vote. The margin of error for registered voters is \u00b12.1 points. Battleground states are Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.\n\nToplines:",

But few election stories are produced by youth. Teens from SRL\u2019s Student Advisory Team originated the idea of an election podcast and pitched the concept to SRL because, as they said in their initial pitch \u201cwe seek to change that.\u201d They believethat youth are more likely to feel represented in political reporting if young people report the stories.\n\n\u201cWe were impressed by the students\u2019 passion and commitment to reporting on political issues that young people care about, from free speech to misinformation and interviews with Gen Z officials and candidates,\u201d said lead podcast producer Briget Ganske. \u201cOn Our Minds is focused on highlighting stories and interviews about youth experience, so this project is well suited for a special podcast season.\u201d\n\nOn Our Minds: Election 2024 is hosted by and co-created with teens: this season involves dozens of student correspondents, reporters, social content creators, and researchers from 15 states.\n\nThis special season, On Our Minds: Election 2024 will include interviews with America\u2019s youngest political candidates and cover topics like how students\u2019 conceptions of America have changed, the electoral college, who gets to vote and make decisions, free speech and censorship, and election disinformation. Episodes will be released every other Wednesday starting August 21, 2024.\n\n\n\nSelect segments and social video this season are collaborations with Teen Vogue\u2019s 2024 Election Correspondents.\n\nOn Our Minds: Election 2024 is distributed by PRX/Dovetail.

        "text": "Weighing the impact of a potential Trump victory\nElections (and other geopolitical events) do not typically have a lasting impact on equity markets. But short-term impacts can be meaningful, and you\u2019d be forgiven if you thought this time might be different.\n\nAt this point, we mostly expect a continuation of the status quo under a Harris administration, though she has announced policy proposals for housing, taxes and other priorities in August. Meanwhile, the Republican party released its updated policy agenda during the Republican National Convention in July. Here, we analyze four key issues \u2013 trade policy, taxes, immigration and industrial spending \u2013 that could change the status quo should former President Trump be re-elected.\n\nTrade policy: How might tariffs impact growth and inflation?\n\nTrump and Biden have used tariffs (taxes paid by U.S. importers of foreign goods) to bolster national defense and increase the global competitiveness of domestic industries. Trump now advocates a 10% baseline tariff on all imported goods and a 60% (or higher) tariff on goods from China. But if Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs were fully implemented, they could lower real U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) by 0.3% to 0.5% in 2025, according to our calculations.\n\nSweeping tariffs could also deliver a one-time shock to inflation, but this sharp immediate impact would likely fade over time. More \u2013 and faster \u2013 permitting and leasing in the oil and gas complex could also provide a disinflationary offset, possibly pushing oil prices down 10% to 15% if supply rises.\n\nWe estimate that the net impact of tariffs and lower energy prices could lead to a 1.5% to 2% jump in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) on a year-on-year basis. These reflationary expectations are likely one of the reasons that interest rates rose and the yield curve steepened when betting odds for a Trump presidency increased.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that the final impact of tariffs could be more modest than our estimates suggest. The proposals could be narrowed, and will likely spark legal challenges, as they have previously. Further, the impact could lessen if the tariffs are staggered over time or if custom duties are recycled into targeted industry subsidies that help companies from passing on the costs to consumers.\n\nOur analysis finds that if Trump\u2019s proposals were fully implemented, the impact on major trading peers would be less inflationary than in the United States, but likely more detrimental to growth. Said differently, we expect tariffs to slow growth disproportionately for goods exporters and raise inflation disproportionately for goods importers. For example, we estimate a potential 0.7% hit to eurozone GDP, roughly twice as large as in the United States, but just a 0.2% (or less) increase in European inflation.\n\nSuch divergence could have implications for the relative monetary policy stance in each region and thus, the euro-U.S. dollar exchange rate. In isolation, Trump\u2019s tariff policy would likely continue to underpin U.S. dollar strength.\n\nTaxes: Which 2017 tax cuts might be extended?\n\nWhoever wins the November U.S. election, the individual provisions of the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act (TCJA) will expire at the end of 2025. If they are not extended, tax rates for most individual taxpayers would rise between 1% and 4%. The law\u2019s corporate tax cut, which lowered rates from 35% to 21%, has no sunset provision.\n\nTrump has said that he would like to extend the law in its entirety, and has even proposed lowering the corporate rate further. Harris has said she would not raise taxes on individuals earning less than $400,000 a year.\n\nIf all the TCJA\u2019s provisions are extended, we would expect near-term growth expectations to rise as high as +0.7% of real GDP. Higher growth comes at the cost of an even higher fiscal deficit. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the fiscal deficit would increase by nearly $5 trillion from fiscal years 2025 to 2034 (as a share of GDP, this would be equivalent to a roughly 1.4 percentage point sustained increase in the fiscal deficit). Of course, rising deficits would only exacerbate the U.S. government\u2019s already elevated levels of federal debt.\n\nAt the moment, neither party looks poised to dramatically reduce the U.S. debt burden. That dynamic, along with the potential for growth upside from even lower tax rates, could put further upward pressure on longer-dated yields and keep bond market volatility high into 2025.",

Lichtman, the American University historian who predicted the outcome of virtually all recent U.S. elections and became famous when he accurately forecast \u2014 against what pollsters were saying \u2014 that Donald Trump would win in 2016, was very cautions when I interviewed him about the 2024 presidential race.\n\nBut, while cautioning that he will issue his official prediction after Labor Day, he gave me a good hint of who has the best chances of winning the race between Democratic hopeful Kamala Harris and Trump.\n\nLichtman, who has developed a system of 13 keys to predict elections \u2014 which he says is more accurate than polls \u2014 told me that \u201ca lot would have to go wrong for the Democratic Party to lose.\u201d Translation: as of now, Harris has the best chances of winning.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLichtman\u2019s prediction system consists of 13 questions that have to be answered each with a \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201cfalse.\u201d If the incumbent party gets a \u201cfalse\u201d in six of the 13 keys, it will lose the White House.\n\nSince he started announcing his forecasts 20 years ago, he was right in nine of the last 10 elections. He says he was actually right in all 10 of them, because the 2000 election was atypical: his pick, Al Gore, won the popular vote, but the Supreme Court gave the election to George W. Bush.\n\nAmong Lichtman\u2019s 13 keys are whether there is an incumbent president running for office, whether there is a strong third-party candidate and whether the economy is doing well.\n\n\u201cRight now the Democrats are down in only three keys\u201d of the six that would be needed for them to lose the election, Lichtman told me. The Democrats are down in the \u201cmandate\u201d key, because they lost the House in the 2022 elections, in the \u201cincumbency\u201d key, because Joe Biden is no longer the candidate, and in the \u201ccharisma\u201d key, because it\u2019s too early to tell whether Harris is charismatic, he explained.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWon\u2019t Trump win the \u201ccharisma\u201d key, as horrible a human being as many of us think he is? I asked Licthman.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t fit the definition of the (charisma) key,\u201d Lichtman responded, \u201cThe keys require that you be broadly appealing. You can\u2019t just appeal to a narrow base like Trump.\u201d\n\nLichtman says that he doesn\u2019t pay attention to the polls because they are just a snapshot of the present, which is not useful to predict what will happen on Election Day.\n\nIn addition, just as pollsters underestimated the pro-Trump vote in 2016, they may now be under-estimating the pro-Democratic vote, he said.\n\n\u201cPollsters say, \u2018You know, our error margin is randomly plus or minus 3% approximately.\u2019 But that\u2019s pure statistical error,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople may lie. They may not have made up their mind yet. They may change their mind.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAs for surveys on donors\u2019 campaign contributions, crowd sizes or debates, he told me, \u201cRemember, based on conventional measures, Hillary Clinton should have won in 2016: She raised more money, had more ads, won all the debates, had a better organization. And, of course, she lost.\u201d\n\nWill Lichtman be right this time again? I have no intention of getting into the election forecasting business, but here\u2019s my humble guess: Harris will easily win the popular vote, and Trump \u2014 if he loses in the electoral college \u2014 will dispute the results.\n\nHe is already preparing the ground for contesting the election by saying Harris staged an alleged illegal \u201ccoup\u201d against Biden\u2019s nomination, still refuses to accept his defeat in the 2020 elections, and routinely praises the insurrectionists who occupied the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in an effort to revert the election results.\n\nOn top of that, Trump has not yet committed to accepting a potential adverse result in this year\u2019s elections. He doesn\u2019t play by the rules of democracy, or decency. So, whatever happens, my prediction is that it will be a big mess.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the \u201cOppenheimer Presenta\u201d TV show on Sundays at 9 pm E.T. on CNN en Espa\u00f1ol.

On the final day of the Democratic National Convention, Ms Harris will formally accept her party's nomination - following a ceremonial roll call earlier in the week during which state delegates confirmed their support. Her running mate Tim Walz spoke on Wednesday night, making a personal pitch to middle America by giving a \"pep talk\" in the vein of an American football coach. US political conventions, which happen every four years before a presidential election, date back to the 1830s, when a group of Democratic delegates supporting President Andrew Jackson gathered to nominate him for a second term. Here\u2019s what to know about the 2024 DNC, which has been attended by thousands of people.\n\nWhat's to come on Thursday?\n\nThe convention has all been building up to Thursday night. When she takes the stage, Vice-President Harris will formally accept the presidential nomination, and give a speech looking ahead to November. It will be the most significant address of her political career. Ms Harris became the Democratic nominee after President Joe Biden stepped aside and gave her his backing, following weeks of pressure from party members. Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, who both represent swing states, are also expected to speak on Thursday - as is high-profile Republican Adam Kinzinger.\n\nWho spoke on Wednesday?\n\nDemocratic National Convention: Oprah and Bill Clinton turn out on Tim Walz's big day\n\nWednesday night was Mr Walz's first significant opportunity to introduce himself to the nation - and specifically to connect with middle America. His speech was heavy on his personal story, including the importance of his family, his teaching career and time spent coaching a high-school football team, his stint in Army National Guard, and his service as a congressman and Minnesota governor. Long-time TV host Oprah Winfrey made a surprise appearance, receiving a raucous response and urging Americans to \"choose truth\" in the upcoming vote. Other prominent Democrats who featured on the same night included grandees Bill Clinton, the former president, and Nancy Pelosi, the former House speaker. There were also appearances by rising stars such as Josh Shapiro, the governor of the swing state of Pennsylvania.\n\nThe Obamas addressed the convention on Tuesday night\n\nEarlier in the week, the convention heard from President Joe Biden, who stepped aside last month for Ms Harris to contest the presidency. On Monday, he gave an emotional defence of his time in the White House: \"America, I gave my best to you.\" The same evening, Hillary Clinton, the 2016 presidential candidate, took the stage and voiced her hope that Ms Harris could finally break the \u201chighest, hardest glass ceiling\u201d in the US by becoming the first female president. During back-to-back speeches on Tuesday, Barack and Michelle Obama mixed gags with serious exhortations to Democrats to get out and vote in November. \"Hope is making a comeback,\" said Mrs Obama. This was a contrast with the \"chaos\" of Donald Trump's time in the White House, Mr Obama added. And Trump's former spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham gave a speech of her own criticising her ex-boss. America's Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff was introduced to the stage on the same night by his son Cole, who called him a \"goofy dad\". Mr Emhoff went on to laud his wife, Ms Harris, as the \"right person\" for him and the presidency alike.\n\nWhat's the purpose of the DNC?\n\nBecause Ms Harris and Mr Walz were already nominated ahead of the event, and the roll call was a formality, this year's convention has been focused on speeches and the adoption of the party\u2019s policy platform. Delegates have been working in the daytimes to finalise the platform, a draft of which has already been released. It focuses on a broad range of issues, including plans to lower inflation, mitigate climate change and tackle gun violence. In the draft, Democrats contrast each of the party positions with Project 2025, an ultra-conservative blueprint for what a second Trump administration could look like, authored by the Heritage Foundation. Trump has sought to distance himself from the project, though several of his allies were involved in writing it.\n\nWatch: Ione Wells explains why Democrats hope influencers can be an election secret weapon\n\nHow can I follow coverage?\n\nMembers of the public can only attend the convention in person by becoming volunteers. But as with the Republican convention, there is plenty of national media coverage, and the convention itself has been offering live-streams on social media platforms. You can follow BBC News coverage - featuring on-site reporting and analysis - across the website and app, and on our livestream. The BBC News Channel is carrying special coverage from 20:00 ET (01:00 BST) each night. You can find special episodes of The Global Story and Americast podcasts on BBC Sounds and other podcast platforms.

They include thousands of delegates chosen by state Democratic parties, as well as party grandees and some members of the Democratic National Committee. As with the equivalent Republican event last month, which featured famous faces as well, the DNC has been a star-studded affair. Winfrey and Lil Jon have been joined by musicians Stevie Wonder, John Legend and Lil Jon, and comedian Mindy Kaling. Rumours have swirled about whether mega-stars Beyonc\u00e9 and Taylor Swift will make appearances themselves, but neither has confirmed anything.\n\nWhat about the protests?\n\nEPA A mostly peaceful protest unfolded on Monday\n\nDemonstrations have been taking place outside the convention centre, focusing on opposition to US support of Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. A further demonstration is planned on Thursday. On Wednesday, a group of delegates who were denied the chance to speak at the convention began a sit-in outside the arena. The delegates, selected in state Democratic primaries earlier this year, have pledged themselves \"uncommitted\" to any presidential candidate as part of an internal protest over Gaza. Earlier in the week, a protest on Tuesday near Chicago's Israeli consulate culminated in scuffles between demonstrators and police and led to several arrests. And thousands of marchers took to the streets for a mostly peaceful protest on Monday, calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and an end to US support for Israel. Several were arrested when dozens of them broke through a security fence. In that night's address, Mr Biden acknowledged that the activists \"have a point\", going on to say that \"a lot of innocent people are being killed, on both sides\".\n\nThe route that has been taken by protesters",

        "text": "Impact of the 2024 US Presidential Election on the Transport and Logistics Market\nAsstrA, an international transport and logistics company, has analyzed the potential impacts of the 2024 US Presidential Election on the transportation and logistics industry. The 2024 US Presidential Election stands as a critical juncture with far-reaching consequences for global markets. The trajectory of US policies on trade, the environment, fiscal matters, and foreign relations will influence the global economic landscape, impacting market stability, international trade patterns, and investments in ecological initiatives.\n\nInfrastructure Investment\n\nIf the Democratic Party wins: The Democratic Party's emphasis on substantial infrastructure investments, including roads, bridges, and ports, could greatly enhance transportation networks. A focus on sustainable projects, promoting electric vehicles (EVs), and expanding EV charging networks could drive the logistics sector toward more environmentally friendly operations.\n\nIf the Republican Party wins: A Republican administration might continue to support traditional infrastructure projects. While this could improve transportation networks, it might not prioritize sustainability to the same extent.\n\n\n\nRegulation and Compliance\n\nIf the Democratic Party wins: Stricter environmental regulations under the Democratic administration could lead to higher compliance costs for transport companies but also incentivize innovation in cleaner technologies. Additionally, there could be an increase in labor and safety regulations impacting the industry.\n\n\n\nIf the Republican Party wins: A Republican administration may continue to roll back environmental regulations, potentially lowering compliance costs for transport companies but possibly affecting the push toward sustainable logistics practices. Policies might favor employer flexibility over strict labor regulations.\n\n\n\nTrade Policies\n\nIf the Democratic Party wins: A Democratic administration is likely to support re-engagement with international trade partners and institutions, potentially reducing trade barriers and creating more stable trade relationships. This could encourage domestic production, altering supply chains with a potential increase in domestic transport and logistics needs.\n\nIf the Republican Party wins: The Republican Party's protectionist trade measures could lead to trade tariffs and barriers, complicating international logistics, and increasing costs and uncertainties in global supply chains. Ongoing renegotiation of trade agreements might create a volatile trade environment.\n\n\n\nPreparing for potential supply chain disruptions\n\nThe first months of 2024 have already strained U.S. supply chains due to various global disruptions. The upcoming presidential election in November adds to the uncertainty, with potential impacts on the U.S. economy and supply chains. Predicting these effects is challenging due to the complexity of factors involved, such as candidates' policies, the economic climate, and political polarization.\n\nPresidential elections consistently create additional risks and disruptions to supply chains. Historical data shows mixed impacts: the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic overshadowed election effects, while the 2016 election caused trade policy uncertainty. In contrast, the 2012 election saw no significant election-related disruptions, and the 2008 financial crisis had a broader impact on supply chains than the election itself.\n\n\n\nKey areas where the 2024 election might influence supply chains include trade policy, infrastructure improvements, regulations, labor laws, and immigration policies. Trade policies can affect the cost and flow of goods, while infrastructure upgrades can enhance transportation efficiency. Regulatory changes and labor laws impact production costs and worker availability. Immigration policies might exacerbate existing labor shortages, particularly in warehouses. Economic policies stemming from the election can influence consumer confidence and spending, potentially causing temporary disruptions in certain sectors.\n\n\n\nThe Impact of U.S. Trade Policies on Global Trade Dynamics\n\nHistorically, the U.S. approach to trade agreements and tariffs has significantly influenced international trade. In 2018, the Republican administration's \"trade war\" tariffs on Chinese imports affected over USD 360 billion worth of goods, disrupting global supply chains and causing a 0.3% dip in global GDP, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The Republicans have pledged to increase these tariffs if re-elected. Surprisingly, the Democratic administration has largely maintained these tariffs during its term but has ramped up criticism of Republican trade policies, promising a drastically different approach if re-elected.\n\n\n\nTrade partners of both China and the United States could experience substantial gains or losses depending on the election outcome and subsequent trade policy changes. For instance, the 2018 increase in U.S. restrictions on Chinese imports allowed Mexico's export share to the U.S. to rise, making it the top U.S. import source this year, surpassing China. On the other hand, Europe struggled to capitalize on U.S.-China trade tensions due to its continued dependence on Chinese supply chains. Despite efforts to \"de-risk\" by reducing investments in China, Europe\u2019s reliance on Chinese manufacturing and supplies remains a hurdle in meeting U.S. import demands and benefiting from potential policy shifts.\n\nGlobal climate leadership and renewable energy investments\n\nA similarly impactful point of contention is the U.S.'s leadership role in climate change initiatives. The American re-entry into the Paris Agreement under the Democratic administration marked a significant shift towards prioritizing climate change on the global stage. This move, alongside the controversial tax-credit-gifting Inflation Reduction Act, has spurred global investments in renewable energy. Due to the U.S.'s size and wealth, manufacturers worldwide are eager to access the American market, with global renewable investments increasing by nearly 50% across all categories since these climate spending policies were enacted in 2021.\n\nThe Republican administration\u2019s skepticism toward some of these extensive climate spending measures stems from a geoeconomic perspective. One area of concern is the rapid adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). Many Western nations, including the U.S., have delayed pro-EV policies due to fears of China's control over essential EV components. The Republicans have already endorsed a reversal and \"then some\" of Democratic climate policies but have not yet addressed whether they would attempt to leave the Paris Agreement again.\n\n\n\nWith both parties firmly committed to their opposing views on the U.S.'s role in the climate debate, America's choice in November is bound to have significant repercussions for international energy markets and green technology investments for at least the next four years.\n\nSources\n\nhttps://www.gtreview.com/magazine/volume-19-issue-1/us-trade-policy-global-impact-biden-presidency/\n\nhttps://www.capitaleconomics.com/key-issues/us-election-2024\n\nhttps://thelondonfinancial.com/economics/how-the-2024-us-presidential-election-will-affect-global-markets\n\nhttps://www.freightwaves.com/news/2024-presidential-election-may-have-big-impact-on-supply-chains\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/pulse/potential-impacts-2024-us-presidential-election-supply-luis-juarez--j3xqe/\n\nhttps://futuresupplychains.org/long-read-a-year-of-elections-but-supply-chain-fragmentation-will-continue/\n\nhttps://www.racetothewh.com/president/polls#google_vignette\n\nhttps://elections2024.thehill.com/forecast/2024/president/\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationwide_opinion_polling_for_the_2024_United_States_presidential_election\n\nhttps://politicalpulse.net/us-politics/alan-lichtmans-prediction-for-2024/",

        "text": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is considering ending presidential campaign, 2 sources say\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. is considering ending his presidential candidacy in the coming days, according to two sources familiar with his campaign, though he has not yet made a final decision.\n\nOn Wednesday, his campaign director, Amaryllis Fox, sent an email to staff thanking them for their contributions to the campaign and informing them that Kennedy was mulling over suspending his campaign.\n\n\"What I've heard from my friends on the campaign is that Bobby is torn. The word that keeps coming up is 'torn.' Ultimately, I think he will endorse Trump,\" said Link Lauren, a former senior adviser to the campaign, in an interview with CBS News.\n\nLate Thursday, CBS News learned that RFK Jr. will not appear on Arizona's ballot despite qualifying this week. His campaign filed new paperwork Thursday to withdraw his candidacy.\n\n\"He won't appear on any ballot,\" a spokesperson with the Arizona Secretary of State's Office told CBS News in a text message.\n\nKennedy's campaign announced on his website that he plans to address the nation on Friday \"about the present historical moment and his path forward.\" ABC News reported that RFK Jr. is expected to end his campaign.\n\nAccording to a source familiar with the campaign, Kennedy realizes he has no path to victory, and the campaign's funding is drying up. His advisers are split, with some encouraging him to drop out and endorse former President Donald Trump, while others urge him to keep running. His wife, Cheryl Hines, dislikes Trump and does not want Kennedy to support him. Cheryl has publicly expressed her dislike of Trump, telling TMZ in February, when asked if she would support RFK on the ticket with Trump, \"I think Bobby knows me very well,\" and laughed when TMZ responded, \"I think that's our answer.\"\n\nSome of those encouraging him to continue running are well-paid by the campaign, including Del Bigtree, the campaign's communications director, who was paid $20,000 in July, and Charles Eisenstein, the campaign's director of messaging, who received $21,667 last month, according to financial filings.\n\nHowever, Kennedy's campaign is over $3 million in debt. His running mate, Nicole Shanahan, has vowed to fund Kennedy's ballot access efforts, including fighting legal challenges brought forward by Democratic Party allies. According to the campaign, Kennedy only needs to submit signatures in four more states, bringing his ballot access efforts close to an end.\n\nShanahan told Tom Bilyeu on the \"Impact Theory\" podcast that Kennedy was considering supporting GOP nominee Donald Trump. She expressed concern that staying in the race might \"draw votes from Trump\" and raised the possibility of \"walking away right now and joining forces with him.\"\n\nShanahan posted on social media on Thursday that \"my old Dem buddies have been flooding me with frantic calls, texts, and emails.\"\n\n\"The message is clear: they're terrified of the idea of our movement joining forces with Donald Trump,\" Shanahan said. \"When I point out what the Democratic Party and their super PACs have done to sabotage our campaign, their response is always, 'but Trump is worse.' Here's an idea: stop suing us. Let us debate. Quit rigging the media and the polls. It's a simple formula, people\u2014get with it.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Shanahan said on the \"Ask Dr. Drew\" podcast, \"I think that Friday is going to be one of the biggest events in American election history.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Sen. JD Vance, Trump's running mate, told CBS News that he would welcome an endorsement from Kennedy.\n\n\"I think it's a great endorsement for the president to have,\" Vance told \"CBS Evening News\" anchor and managing editor Norah O'Donnell on Wednesday. \"I don't know if it's actually going to happen, but I'd certainly welcome it and encourage RFK to join the team.\"\n\nA source close to Trump told CBS News' Robert Costa that any Trump endorsement by Kennedy would be about \"Bobby coming to us\" and \"offering support\" due to his own conclusions about a path forward, not about Trump making a deal or promise to the presidential candidate.\n\nIn July, Kennedy's son released a video of a speakerphone conversation RFK Jr. had with Trump, in which the former president could be heard agreeing with Kennedy's discredited views on vaccines before trying to convince him to endorse his campaign.\n\n\"I would love you to do something. And I think it'll be so good for you and so big for you,\" Trump told Kennedy. \"And we're going to win,\" he added.\n\nKennedy's campaign has not yet responded to a request for comment.\n\nKennedy also recently approached Vice President Kamala Harris's presidential campaign to discuss the possibility of serving in her administration, two sources familiar with the situation told CBS News, but Harris and her advisers did not agree to meet him.\n\n\"No one has any intention of negotiating with a MAGA-funded fringe candidate who has sought out a job with Donald Trump in exchange for an endorsement,\" one Harris campaign source said.\n\nIn response to the possibility that Kennedy could end his presidential bid, the Democratic National Committee issued a statement saying, \"desperate men do desperate things.\"\n\n\"RFK Jr. was recruited by MAGA, funded by MAGA, and parroted MAGA talking points. No one should be shocked if he formalizes his relationship in an attempt to maintain relevance,\" said Mary Beth Cahill, a DNC senior adviser.\n\nand contributed to this report.",

        "text": "New UH/TSU Survey Finds Trump\u2019s Lead Among Likely Texas Voters is Narrowing\n\u2800\n\nUH/TSU survey finds Trump leading Harris in Texas 49.5% - 44.6% UH/TSU survey finds Cruz leads Allred 46.6% - 44.5% in U.S. Senate race\n\nNearly half of Texans plan to vote for former Republican President Donald Trump in November, according to a new survey of likely voters, while 44.6% support the Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nWhile Trump has increased his vote share slightly in the past two months \u2013 49.5% now, compared to 48.9% in June \u2013 Harris has chipped away at his lead, shrinking the gap to just under 5 points. That\u2019s notably tighter than the nine-point lead Trump held over President Joe Biden in the earlier survey, part of a series conducted by the Hobby School of Public Affairs at the University of Houston and the Executive Master of Public Administration program in the Barbara Jordan \u2013 Mickey Leland School of Public Affairs at Texas Southern University.\n\n\u201cHarris has made considerable headway among voters both in Texas and nationally in the short time since she entered the race last month,\u201d said Ren\u00e9e Cross, researcher and senior executive director of the Hobby School. \u201cThat\u2019s particularly true among younger voters, with 55% of Gen Z voters saying they will support her, compared to just 39% who backed Biden, but she also has gained among women and independent voters.\u201d\n\nStill, Cross noted, Texas remains a red state, with Trump maintaining a strong lead among men, white voters and older voters.\n\nTrump holds a narrow lead over Harris, 47% to 46%, among Latino voters, a sharp contrast to 2020 when Texas Latinos backed Biden over Trump by a 17-point margin.\n\nThe survey also found the race for U.S. Senate between Republican incumbent Ted Cruz and Democrat Colin Allred remains tight, with Cruz leading 46.6% to 44.5%; 6.4% are undecided, and 2.5% support Libertarian Ted Brown.\n\nThis second-wave survey followed Biden\u2019s historic decision to drop out of the 2024 presidential race and Harris\u2019 nomination. A substantial number of respondents from the June survey were reinterviewed, along with the addition of new respondents to ensure a representative sample.\n\nMark P. Jones, political science fellow at Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute for Public Policy and senior research fellow at the Hobby School, said Trump\u2019s continued dominance in the state obscures some changes revealed by the survey.\n\n\u201cWhat had been a stable race, with Trump leading Biden by a margin in the high single digits for months, has tightened,\u201d he said. \u201cSupport has declined for third-party candidates, especially Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who dropped to 2% in this survey from 5% in June, with more than twice as many of Kennedy\u2019s former supporters switching their votes to Harris than to Trump\u201d.\n\nJust 2.7% of likely Texas voters remain undecided in the presidential race.\n\nMichael Adams, director of the Executive Master of Public Administration graduate program at TSU, said Harris\u2019 gains among Independent voters account for much of her increased support over Biden, with most of that coming from people who previously backed Kennedy or Stein.\n\n\u201cIndependent voters in Texas are fairly evenly split between Trump and Harris, at 41% vs. 39%,\u201d Adams said. \u201cIn June, with Biden still in the race, we found that 42% of Independents favored Trump, while just 18% supported Biden. It appears that a substantial portion of the third-party vote in part reflected a desire for another candidate, and Harris has provided that.\u201d\n\nEight percent of Independent voters now back Kennedy, while 5% favor Stein or Oliver; that compares to June, when 14% of Independents supported Kennedy and 10% backed Stein or Oliver.\n\nAmong the survey\u2019s other findings:\n\nHarris is drawing women voters away from Trump. She holds a six-point lead among women, 50% to 44%. In June, Trump held a four-point lead over Biden among women, 46% to 42%. (Trump holds an 18-point lead over Harris among men, 56% to 38%.)\n\nThe race appears stable: 96% of Harris voters and 92% of Trump voters say they are certain about their vote choice, with only 4% and 8% respectively saying they might change their minds before the November election.\n\nBlack voters favor Allred over Cruz, 72% to 20%, while Latinos support Allred over Cruz by a smaller margin, 46% to 40%. White voters favor Cruz, 57% to 40%.\n\nAllred holds a seven-point lead over Cruz among women, 49% to 42%, while Cruz holds a 13-point lead among men, 52% to 39%.\n\nHarris\u2019 net favorability rating has improved considerably since June. Currently 48% of Texas likely voters say they have a favorable opinion of her, while 51% have an unfavorable opinion, for a net favorability rating of -3%. That\u2019s down from -14% in June.\n\n49% of likely voters have a favorable opinion of Trump, while 50% have an unfavorable opinion, for a net favorability rating of -1%.\n\nThe survey was conducted between Aug. 5-16 in English and Spanish. The margin of error is +/-2.65%.",

        "text": "'There'll be a revolution': Deep divisions ahead of 2024 presidential election\nIn Woodstock, Illinois, they know all about the cycle of repetition.\n\nThe small town, around an hour's drive from Chicago, where this week's Democratic National Convention is being held, is actually where the movie Groundhog Day was filmed.\n\nIts part in movie history is marked by a huge mural on the main street, a poster of the film's star Bill Murray in the estate agent window and a plaque at the bed and breakfast which featured as one of the sets.\n\nBut in a place where a narrative of monotony is celebrated, the story now is about the upcoming presidential election and a new offer that goes beyond re-electing an incumbent. But for many here, Kamala Harris is an elusive candidate.\n\n\"It's tough to make a decision on something where you were thinking one way and now you have to switch your gears because it's a whole new person,\" says Matt Drennan, who owns a shop on the main square selling model trains.\n\n\"I want to hear what she's going to do, what's going to be different than what's already been done.\"\n\nUsually, by the time a national convention arrives, there is a clear sense of the policy platforms of the nominee.\n\nImage: Woodstock was the location for the film Groundhog Day\n\nWhen Hillary Clinton ran for president in 2016, she had more than 200 distinct policy proposals. Four years ago, Joe Biden had a 110-page policy document for his White House bid.\n\nNow, Vice President Kamala Harris doesn't even have a policy page on her campaign website, perhaps owing to her late entry into the race. Her campaign seems to be propelled at the moment by good vibes and the overall energy she brings.\n\n\"I mean, honestly, she just got into the race,\" says Matt. \"She was the vice president and if you look at the history - other than Al Gore - most of the vice presidents nobody knows much about.\n\n\"The big problem is you don't totally know her policies yet,\" he adds, \"so I'm reading up on that to see what works, to see who is the best candidate for small business and the economy.\n\n\"I'm doing my research and my due diligence now.

        "text": "RFK Jr. endorses Trump and suspends presidential campaign\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. suspended his independent presidential campaign and threw his support behind GOP nominee Donald Trump on Friday, saying in remarks in Phoenix that he was endorsing the former president because he saw no viable path to the White House.\n\n\"In my heart, I no longer believe that I have a realistic path to electoral victory,\" Kennedy said. \"I cannot in good conscience ask my staff and volunteers to keep working their long hours or ask my donors to keep giving when I cannot honestly tell them that I have a real path to the White House.\"\n\nKennedy said three issues convinced him to leave the Democratic Party and \"to throw my support to President Trump\": free speech, the war in Ukraine and what he called the \"war on our children.\"\n\n\"My joining the Trump campaign will be a difficult sacrifice for my wife and children, but worthwhile if there's even a small chance of saving these kids,\" he said. He said processed foods, chemicals and obesity were destroying the health of children in the U.S.\n\nKennedy later appeared at a rally with Trump in Glendale, Arizona. Trump said Kennedy would \"have a huge influence on this campaign.\"\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. makes an announcement on the future of his campaign in Phoenix, Arizona, on Aug. 23, 2024. Thomas Machowicz / REUTERS\n\nThe son of Robert F. Kennedy and the nephew of President John F. Kennedy, RFK Jr.'s announcement was met with condemnation by other members of the storied political family. His sister Kerry Kennedy said in a statement on behalf of herself and four other family members that his decision to endorse Trump was \"a betrayal of the values that our father and our family hold most dear\" and \"a sad ending to a sad story.\"\n\nHis wife, the actress Cheryl Hines, thanked volunteers for their work on the campaign, saying they \"accomplished feats that were said to be impossible.\"\n\nBut Kennedy acknowledged Friday that his wife wasn't pleased with his decision. \"I am so grateful to my amazing wife Cheryl for her unconditional love, as I made a political decision with which she is very uncomfortable. I wish this also for the country \u2014 love and unity even in the face of disagreement. We will need that in coming times,\" Kennedy tweeted.\n\nKennedy also said he wasn't \"terminating\" his campaign, merely suspending it, and he would remain on the ballot in many noncompetitive states. \"In about 10 battleground states where my presence would be a spoiler, I'm going to remove my name, and I've already started the process,\" he said, adding that people in red states and blue states could vote for him \"without harming or helping President Trump or Vice President Harris.\"\n\nAnd he held out the distant possibility that if neither Trump nor Harris were able to win 270 electoral votes, tying 269 to 269, \"I could conceivably still end up in the White House in a contingent election.\"\n\nAt his Glendale rally, Trump vowed, if elected, to establish an independent presidential commission on assassination attempts that would be tasked with releasing all of the remaining documents related to JFK's assassination. He also said that he'd establish a panel to investigate chronic health problems and childhood diseases.\n\n\"All who supported Bobby's campaign, I very simply ask you join us in building this coalition \u2014 it's a beautiful coalition \u2014 in defense of liberty and safety, prosperity and peace,\" Trump said.\n\nKennedy's campaign\n\nKennedy's campaign had been seeking ballot access in states including Arizona as recently as this week, although he filed paperwork Thursday evening to withdraw his candidacy in the battleground state \u2014 a foreshadowing of his announcement. When he suspended his campaign, he was on the ballot in over 23 states and awaiting confirmation in another 22.\n\nBefore his speech, he disclosed that he was ending his candidacy in a court filing in Pennsylvania and said he and running mate Nicole Shanahan were seeking to withdraw their petition to appear on Pennsylvania's presidential ballot.\n\nHe will be on the ballot in the battleground state of Michigan, however.\n\n\"He cannot withdraw at this point,\" a spokesperson from Michigan's office of the secretary of state. \"His name will remain on the ballot.\"\n\nIn his remarks, Kennedy claimed that \"in an honest system, I believe that I would have won the election.\"\n\nHe blasted the Democratic Party \u2014 his former party and that of his father and uncle \u2014 saying that it has become \"the party of war, censorship, corruption, big pharma, big tech, big tech, big ag and big money.\"\n\nKennedy thanked his staffers for their tireless work these months.\n\n\"You carried me off that glass mountain,\" he said.\n\nKennedy originally entered the race as a Democrat, challenging President Biden for the nomination, before deciding last October to run as an independent. Kennedy is a bestselling author and was an environmental lawyer who worked on issues such as clean water.\n\nJen O'Malley Dillon, the chair of Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign, appealed to Kennedy's supporters in a statement after his announcement Friday.\n\n\"For any American out there who is tired of Donald Trump and looking for a new way forward, ours is a campaign for you,\" she said. \"In order to deliver for working people and those who feel left behind, we need a leader who will fight for you, not just for themselves, and bring us together, not tear us apart. Vice President Harris wants to earn your support.\"\n\nIn one of the more surprising revelations during his campaign, Kennedy also admitted that he had put a dead bear cub in New York City's Central Park nearly 10 years ago.\n\nNo poll has shown Kennedy with enough support to defeat either Trump and Harris nationally or in any state, but polls during his campaign suggested he might attract enough support to make a difference in some of the battleground states where the margins of victory were thin in 2020 and 2016.\n\nKennedy, one of 11 children, lost both his uncle and father to assassinations. He received Secret Service protection last month after the assassination attempt on Trump in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn recent years, Kennedy has promoted anti-vaccine conspiracy theories and was shunned by several members of his family who earlier this year endorsed Mr. Biden.\n\nand contributed to this report.",

They're generally voting against the candidate they hate the most.\n\n\"And that's no way for a democracy to function.\"\n\nMs Stein calls for an \"economic bill of rights\" that would include universal access to healthcare and a right to employment. She also vows to fight climate change, defend abortion access and transgender rights, and was recently arrested at a student protest on behalf of Gaza.\n\nShe is unlikely to get more than 2% of the vote - but that could still play spoiler to Ms Harris. Hillary Clinton supporters partly blame her for the Democrat's narrow defeat in 2016. In three critical states, Mrs Clinton lost to Mr Trump by fewer votes than Ms Stein received.\n\nDuring this election cycle, Ms Stein has accused Democrats of trying \"to sue us off multiple state ballots\" to cheat and \"change the rules to maintain their grip on power\".\n\nAccording to the party's website, Ms Stein will be on the ballot in at least four states, though her campaign is working to be added to more states. Butch Ware, a professor at the University of California Santa Barbara, is her running-mate.",

        "text": "Robert F Kennedy Jr suspends campaign and backs Trump\nRobert F Kennedy Jr suspends campaign and backs Trump\n\nFoo Fighters and fireworks: Trump introduces RFK at rally\n\nIndependent White House candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr has joined the Republican nominee, Donald Trump, on stage at a rally in Arizona after dropping out of the race and endorsing the former US president. Mr Kennedy, 70, a Democrat for most of his life and the scion of the Kennedy dynasty, said the principles that had led him to leave the party had now compelled him \"to throw my support to President Trump\". He said in a press conference in Phoenix, Arizona, on Friday that he would seek to remove his name from the ballot in 10 battleground states. Before welcoming RFK Jr to the stage on Friday, Trump promised, if elected, to release all remaining documents relating to the 1963 assassination of President John F Kennedy.\n\nTrump praised Mr Kennedy as \"phenomenal\" and \"brilliant\" at the rally later in Glendale. Democratic rival Kamala Harris said she would try to \"earn\" the support of Kennedy voters. With November's election looming, Mr Kennedy's polling has slumped from a high of double figures as funds and national coverage dried up. The son of US Senator Robert F Kennedy and nephew of President John F Kennedy, he is from the most famed family in Democratic politics. Mr Kennedy's decision to back a Republican for the White House has outraged his relatives, who previously condemned his invocation of the family name in a Super Bowl ad back in February. Kerry Kennedy, his sister, said his support for Trump was a \"betrayal of the values that our father and our family hold most dear. It is a sad ending to a sad story.\" \u201cThis decision is agonising for me because of the difficulties it causes my wife and my children and my friends,\u201d Mr Kennedy said on Friday. \u201cBut I have the certainty that this is what I\u2019m meant to do. And that certainty gives me internal peace, even in storms.\u201d He is married to Cheryl Hines, the star of HBO comedy Curb Your Enthusiasm. She posted on X, formerly Twitter, that she deeply respected her husband\u2019s decision to suspend his campaign. She did not comment on his endorsement of Trump.\n\nUS election: RFK Jr drops presidential campaign and supports Donald Trump\n\nMr Kennedy told reporters on Friday that Trump's insistence he could end the war in Ukraine by negotiating with Russia \"alone would justify my support for his campaign\". \"There are still many issues and approaches on which we continue to have very serious differences. But we are aligned on other key issues.\" He said he would remove his name from 10 states where his presence would be a \"spoiler\" to Trump's effort. He has already withdrawn from the battleground states of Arizona and Pennsylvania. But it is too late for him to pull out from the swing states of Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin, election officials told AP news agency. Mr Kennedy said he had launched his campaign in April 2023 \"as a Democrat, the party of my father, my uncle... the champions of the Constitution\". But he left because \"it had become the party of war, censorship, corruption, big pharma, big tech, big money\". He blamed his decision to suspend his campaign on \"media control\" and his former party's efforts to thwart his run, adding: \"In my heart I no longer believe I have a realistic path to victory in the face of relentless and systematic censorship.\"\n\nReuters Trump welcomes RFK on stage in Glendale, Arizona\n\nMr Kennedy hovered around 14% - 16% in polls at his most popular. However, his ratings have slumped to single digits since Ms Harris became the Democratic nominee. He said in his press conference that he had offered to work with Ms Harris and her bid for the White House. Democrats sounded unfazed by his announcement. \"Donald Trump isn't earning an endorsement that's going to help build support, he's inheriting the baggage of a failed fringe candidate. Good riddance,\" Democratic National Committee senior adviser Mary Beth Cahill said in a statement. Mr Kennedy's campaign became synonymous with the anti-vaccine movement as he frequently touted his leadership of the Children's Health Defense organisation, formerly known as the World Mercury Project. In recent weeks, Mr Kennedy recounted how he dumped a dead bear cub that had been hit by a car in New York's Central Park in 2014 as a joke. Earlier in his campaign, it was revealed that he had suffered from a brain parasite over a decade ago which caused severe memory loss and brain fog. His announcement capped days of rumour that Mr Kennedy offered to endorse Trump to secure a role in his next administration. Trump told CNN earlier this week he would \"certainly be open\" to Mr Kennedy playing a role, while Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr, said he would be suited to \"blow up\" a federal department. Merrill Matthews, a resident scholar with the conservative Institute for Policy Innovation, told the BBC that Mr Kennedy's decision highlighted the two-party system in the US and \"how difficult it is to get new ideas and fresh people into the process\". Mike Wendling also contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Kamala Harris banks on hunger for change, with few policy details\nKamala Harris campaign is light on policy - but that's helped her transform the race\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe month since Kamala Harris launched her presidential campaign has been a largely unprecedented spell in American politics: never has a modern general election campaign gone from a standstill to a full sprint so quickly. In that time Democrats pulled together a well-scripted national convention with slickly produced promotional videos, political set-pieces and musical interludes, all done to boost the new nominee. It was a remarkable test of skill by party operatives under extreme pressure. Over the course of four days in Chicago \u2013 and in the packed campaign rallies Ms Harris has held over the past few weeks \u2013 the outlines of her campaign strategy have begun to take shape. And it\u2019s not exactly what one would expect from a sitting vice-president who has occupied an office in the White House for three-and-a-half-years. Ms Harris is pushing hard to be viewed as the candidate of change in this race. One who, as she said in her convention speech on Thursday, can \"chart a new way forward\". This strategy is in part born out of necessity. Across the globe democracies have been roiled by voter unrest. As economies struggle to recover from the Covid pandemic, regional conflicts churn and tensions over immigration flare up, political incumbents have faced deeply unhappy electorates in Canada, the UK, Germany and India among others. Polling indicated that President Joe Biden, before he abandoned his re-election campaign last month, was set to confront similar challenges. The vice-president has turned this situation on its head. Her background and personal story is a sharp contrast with both the current president and her Republican opponent. It also helps that Ms Harris is running against a former president who, while also styling himself as a change candidate, has his own sometimes controversial, sometimes unpopular White House record to defend. \u201cThis election, I do strongly believe, is about two very different visions for the future,\u201d Ms Harris said at a rally in North Carolina last week. \u201cOurs focused on the future, and the other focused on the past.\u201d\n\nKamala Harris accepts Democratic nomination 'on behalf of the people'\n\nWhy vagueness might suit Harris\n\nFor the most part, Ms Harris has shied away from describing in detail what her presidency would look like. There\u2019s talk of unity and a way beyond America\u2019s divisive partisanship; a focus on strengthening the economy and reducing consumer prices; and a heavy emphasis on reproductive rights and abortion \u2013 an area of particular strength for Democrats. But it is vague. And this vagueness may suit the Harris campaign just fine. By largely being an empty policy vessel, Ms Harris has allowed various constituencies within the Democratic Party to project their hopes and priorities onto her. If she can keep all those pieces together for the next few months, she might just win.\n\nLabour leaders expressed optimism that she would focus on union protections and bread-and-butter economic issues. Climate activists touted the Biden administration\u2019s clean energy legislation and expected the candidate to expand that effort. Civil rights leaders predicted the first woman of colour to win a major party nomination would advance racial equality. \u201cThe fundamental question people ask is, are you fighting for me, or are you fighting for someone else?\u201d said Tom Perez, who served as secretary of labour in the Obama administration and has been an adviser to the Biden White House. \"I think people have a pretty clear sense that she's a fighter for everyone, not just certain people in certain zip codes or certain tax brackets, not just people of certain races or ethnicities, but everyone.\" In other words, the vice-president\u2019s policy vagueness has allowed her to cast as broad an appeal as possible in what is shaping up to be an election where every undecided voter counts. It has been labelled by some as a \"vibe\" campaign - based at least in part on feeling and general impressions. On Wednesday, former television host, author and international celebrity Oprah Winfrey, who identified herself as a political independent, said Ms Harris and her running mate Tim Walz were the candidates who would deliver \u201cdecency and respect\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m calling on all you independents and all you undecideds,\u201d she said. \u201cValues and character matter most of all, in leadership and in life.\u201d\n\nWhat young Democrats want from Kamala Harris if she wins\n\nThroughout the week, a parade of Republicans \u2013 including former officeholders and Donald Trump supporters \u2013 also took the stage at the convention to pitch Harris as the best option in November. \u201cHarris will want to be centre-left, not far-left,\u201d said Chris Shays, a former Republican congressman from Connecticut who attended the Democratic Convention this year. According to Mr Shays, the vice-president will be pulled to the American political middle because that is where the nation is. Ms Harris\u2019s strategy is not without risk, however. Just as Democratic groups are projecting their ideas onto the vice-president\u2019s campaign, so are her Republican opponents. And they are using Ms Harris\u2019s past, more liberal \u2013 and sometimes controversial \u2013 positions and statements as evidence that the lack of specificity is merely a cover for a left-wing agenda. \u201cHer speech was the perfect example of what happens when you have no solutions to offer for the problems you've delivered to Americans' doorsteps, so you gaslight and deflect,\u201d the Trump campaign said in a statement responding to the vice-president\u2019s convention address. Ms Harris has also avoided sweeping press conferences and more pointed interviews with mainstream media outlets so far \u2013 interviews that could hold her to account for past positions and press her for further policy details. Her speech last week addressing the economy was one of the few instances where the vice-president unveiled concrete new proposals.\n\nMore on US election\n\nWatch on BBC iPlayer (UK Only) Who Is Kamala Harris?\n\nBut over the past four days some nuggets of how she would govern have emerged. She has proposed a $25,000 tax credit for first-time homebuyers. She pledged to use the power of government to reduce the cost of prescription drugs and punish price-gouging for groceries. She backed bipartisan immigration legislation that was blocked in the Senate earlier this year. Ms Harris also pledged to push for a federal law that would guarantee a basic right to abortion across the entire US, pre-empting conservative state bans. For some Democrats the details so far aren\u2019t enough. \u201cWe need to hear some actual policy things,\u201d said Lewanna Tucker, chair of the Democratic Party in Fulton County, Georgia. \u201cShe needs to be letting us a little bit more behind the curtain and talk about structural things that are going to be done.\u201d Perhaps more concrete policy details aren't necessary. At a time when American politics is viewed by much of the American public as divisive and toxic, there may be benefit to building a political campaign not around policy specifics, but rather one that appeals to emotion. In 2008, Barack Obama successfully campaigned on hope and change \u2013 which is not exactly the makings of a four-point plan. \u201cIt's a return to a level of hope that I don't think that we have collectively experienced since 2008,\u201d said Yasmin Radjy, who runs the liberal grassroots organising group Swing Left. She said there had been an exhaustion among volunteers on the left for the past eight years, but the switch to Ms Harris was \u201clike a weight had lifted off their shoulders\".",

        "text": "Ask an expert: Climate, weather and energy in the 2024 presidential election\nQ: What are some of the impacts of climate change that may affect our communities? What can be done to prepare for climate-driven disasters like forest fires, drought, flooding, etc.?\n\nErica Smithwick is a Distinguished Professor of Geography at Penn State. She is a landscape and ecosystem ecologist and serves as the director of Penn State\u2019s Earth and Environmental Systems Institute and associate director of the Institute of Energy and the Environment. Smithwick leads the Penn State Climate Consortium that brings together interdisciplinary researchers in partnership with society to innovate climate solutions.\n\nSmithwick: Unnatural disasters are becoming the norm. Extreme weather is about 10 times more likely now than in the past and each year seems to be worse than the one before. Unhealthy air from wildfire smoke, heat waves, droughts, floods and more intense storms are more common because of climate change. The good news is that every degree of warming we prevent by reducing our emissions will reduce the chances these extremes get even worse, so combatting greenhouse gas emissions remains a top priority. However, we also need to be prepared to support communities grappling with unnatural, extreme events. For example, in the case of wildfire, this means new considerations about building in fire prone areas, increased awareness and education about fire dangers and preparedness, and putting beneficial fire back on the landscape in ways that promote healthy habitats and reduce fire risk. We also need to be aware that wildfire smoke has damaging health impacts, especially on children and vulnerable populations, so minimizing smoke exposure is critical.\n\nStempel: Coastal communities are seeing real impacts now. We\u2019re talking about athletic fields turning into marshes, sewer systems that are failing, beaches becoming too small to sit on, or water infiltrating into water supply systems and causing treatment failures. These things affect people\u2019s lives and livelihoods in profound ways, and often stress budgets and our capacity to respond to disasters when they do happen.\n\nAddressing these impacts involves tradeoffs. Saving the beach that drives the tourist economy may mean letting it migrate inland and having to move buildings. The best thing we can do for communities is to help them connect the dots and understand how local impacts are connected to larger changes so they can weigh the tradeoffs and make smart decisions. For instance, increasing rainwater infiltration may help reduce the impact of saltwater intrusion contaminating drinking water wells and solve both a drainage problem and a water treatment problem.\n\nQ: Who is at risk of being displaced by disasters resulting from climate change? How can communities prepare to handle climate refugees when disasters happen?\n\nStempel: Anyone can be displaced. We often don\u2019t talk enough about the diversity of people who are displaced because people with enough resources may assimilate into new communities and secure better housing than people with less resources. Those most vulnerable to getting stuck in portable temporary housing or becoming unhoused are those people who are already economically disadvantaged or in substandard housing. The best thing we can do pre- or post-disaster is help people find secure housing and transportation that allows them to apply their skills and talents to thrive. Being productive and contributing to communities can also be a very important part of psychological health and healing after disaster. It would be even better if we could keep communities of faith or neighborhoods together when they are displaced. Fundamentally, this means we invest in housing and transportation now and create policies that make building or converting existing buildings to housing practical.\n\nQ: What solutions can we pursue today to mitigate risks and adapt to the effects of climate change?\n\nSmithwick: Talk about it. We know that most people care about what's happening, but they aren't talking about it with their friends and neighbors. It's time to engage in these conversations so that we can identify ways to support our communities. And the good news is that we do have solutions. Cutting edge advancements in batteries, renewable energy technologies, resilient building design, sustainable materials, climate finance and more are being developed right now. Deployment of the solutions, at the scale needed to address the challenge, is the real issue and this will take an \"all hands-on deck\" approach. Recent incentives, such as the Inflation Reduction Act and related investments in community-focused research and application are examples of how resources can be redirected to support climate innovation and resilience.\n\nStempel: We need to talk to one another. In my work on coastal adaptation, I meet many people who are seeing and experiencing climate impacts now. Even if they think differently than I do, they can see the tangible effects of climate change. This opens people to conversations that until recently were unthinkable. My perception is that there is a growing majority of people who are prepared to act in some way, but the fear of being attacked or ostracized by a social group still holds them back from speaking. We need to make reasonable people feel comfortable enough to engage. Those of us promoting adaptation and mitigation need to be open to the idea that the solutions we might prefer may not be the best for a particular community, just as communities need to come to terms with the fact that universal protection is not feasible or advisable. Nothing substantial can happen until we make space for a meaningful conversation and listen to one another.\n\nFor more information or to speak with one of our election experts, contact mediarelations@psu.edu.",

        "text": "Trump Harris debate: Campaigns spar over muting microphones\nTrump and Harris spar over muting debate microphones\n\nUS Election: 'ABC is a disgrace' - Trump on the looming debate\n\nThe Donald Trump and Kamala Harris campaigns are sparring over whether to mute one of the microphones when it is the other person's turn to speak during the pair's scheduled debate next month. The Harris campaign said in a statement to the BBC's US partner CBS News that it wanted both candidates\u2019 microphones to be live throughout the full broadcast. The Trump campaign reportedly wants the ABC debate, scheduled for 10 September, to be governed by the same rules agreed when Joe Biden was the Democratic candidate. That would mean the microphones being muted. The apparent impasse comes as the former president questioned the impartiality of the network and signalled he might even skip the debate.\n\nBefore President Joe Biden stepped down as the Democratic party nominee, his campaign agreed with Trump's campaign to participate in two debates - one previously held in June on CNN and one to air on ABC News this September. The Biden campaign negotiated the rules for the debate and agreed that the microphone would be muted when a candidate wasn't speaking. The Trump campaign agreed to the rule, which was enforced during the June CNN debate. But now, with just 15 days until the ABC News debate in Philadelphia is scheduled to air, the Harris campaign wants the microphones to be \"hot\" - meaning they will never be turned off for the duration of the debate. This would allow the two candidates to interrupt and speak over each other on the debate stage. \"The vice president is ready to deal with Trump\u2019s constant lies and interruptions in real time. Trump should stop hiding behind the mute button,\" Harris campaign senior communications adviser Brian Fallon said in a statement.\n\nWhat young Democrats want from Kamala Harris if she wins\n\nTrump, meanwhile, told reporters on Monday that he'd rather have the microphones on during the debate, but said it \"worked out fine\" when they were muted on stage with Mr Biden. \"We agreed to the same rules and same specifications and I think that's probably what it should be, but they're trying to change it,\" he said. \"The truth is they're trying to get out of it because she doesn't want to debate. She's not a good debater.\" Trump's campaign, in a statement to Politico, reiterated the former president's accusation that Ms Harris was looking to find a way to get out of the debate. \u201cEnough with the games. We accepted the ABC debate under the exact same terms as the CNN debate,\" senior Trump adviser Jason Miller told Politico. \"The Harris camp, after having already agreed to the CNN rules, asked for a seated debate, with notes, and opening statements. We said no changes to the agreed upon rules.\u201d A Harris campaign official who was asked about the Trump campaign's claims said they were \"100% false\", according to CBS News. On Trump's Truth Social platform on Sunday, he questioned whether the ABC News journalists moderating the debate would give the questions to the Harris campaign ahead of time. \"Why would I do the debate against Kamala Harris on that network?\" he wrote. This is not the first time the former president has suggested he could back out of a debate. Earlier this month, Trump said he would only debate Ms Harris if the debate was hosted by Fox News. He reversed course several days later. Meanwhile, as the 5 November election nears, the Harris campaign said it has raised $540 million since Biden stepped down, the Associated Press reports. Harris saw record-breaking fundraising numbers in the aftermath of Mr Biden dropping out of the race. The Trump campaign, on the other hand, raised $138.7 million in July and has $327 million cash on hand.",

        "text": "FAU/Mainstreet USA Poll: Harris Gains Momentum in Wake of DNC\nFAU/Mainstreet USA Poll: Harris Gains Momentum in Wake of DNC\n\nThe 2024 presidential election is just a few months away\n\nA new poll from the Florida Atlantic University Political Communication and Public Opinion Research Lab ( PolCom Lab ) and Mainstreet Research USA reveals significant shifts in the 2024 U.S. presidential race, underscoring deep gender and racial divides among voters across the nation. Watch the video analysis of this report at faupolling.com.\n\nU.S. Vice President Kamala Harris has taken the lead over former U.S. President Donald Trump nationally, with 47% of voters supporting her compared to Trump\u2019s 43%. Among likely voters, Harris leads 49% to 45%. She has gained strong support among women, with 53% backing her, while 45% of men favor her. Trump\u2019s base remains predominantly male, with 47% support from men, compared to 41% from women.\n\n\n\nHarris also holds substantial advantages among Black voters (73%), Hispanic voters (51%), and white college-educated voters (57%). Trump, however, continues to command strong support among white voters without a college degree, with 59% favoring him.\n\n\u201cSince her elevation to the top of the ticket, Vice President Harris has effectively appealed to women voters, and the gender gap has become more pronounced,\u201d said Luzmarina Garcia, Ph.D., assistant professor of political science at FAU. \u201cHarris has also reestablished the Democratic Party\u2019s advantage with minority voters.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s Support Erodes Among Independents\n\nHarris has also made significant inroads among Independent voters, now capturing 48% of their support, compared to Trump\u2019s 35%. This marks a notable shift from July when Independents were more evenly split, with 45% backing Harris and 43% supporting Trump.\n\n\u201cTrump is losing support from Independents compared to July, which could be a result of the Democratic Party convention and remains to be watched,\u201d said Dukhong Kim, Ph.D., associate professor of political science at FAU. \u201cIf this pattern persists, it will be difficult for Trump to maintain an advantage in the election.\u201d\n\nCongressional Voting Preferences\n\nThe poll shows that 46% of respondents would vote for the Democratic Party candidate in their district, compared to 44% for the Republican Party candidate.\n\n\u201cThe generic ballot illustrates just how closely divided the nation continues to be,\u201d said Kevin Wagner, Ph.D., professor of political science and co-director of the PolCom Lab. \u201cIt suggests that the current default is for close and tightly contested elections.\u201d\n\nElection Anxiety: Mixed Emotions Ahead of 2024\n\nThe poll reveals a stark emotional divide as the election approaches, with negative emotions slightly outweighing positive ones by 44% to 41%. This emotional split becomes more pronounced when viewed through the lens of voting intentions:\n\nHarris supporters: 52% positive, 35% negative\n\nTrump supporters: 34% positive, 49% negative\n\nUndecided voters: 23% positive, 50% negative\n\nNotably, 27% of Democrats reported feeling excited about the election, while 32% of Republicans expressed fear.\n\n\u201cWhile Democrats seem energized by the Harris-Walz ticket, there\u2019s a significant undercurrent of anxiety across the electorate,\u201d said Carol Bishop Mills, Ph.D., professor of communication and co-director of the PolCom Lab. \u201cThese findings highlight the intense political polarization and uncertainty surrounding this election.\u201d\n\nPerception of Candidates\n\nOn the political spectrum, Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, representing the Democratic ticket, are generally perceived as left-leaning. Harris is viewed as more strongly on the far left (37%), compared to Walz (28%). However, Walz is seen as more moderate, with 18% of voters placing him in the center, compared to fewer voters unsure of Harris\u2019 position. On the Republican side, Trump and Vance are viewed as right-leaning, with Trump categorized as far right by 37% of voters and Vance by 30%. Trump\u2019s position is highly polarized, with voters seeing him as either far right or far left, while Vance has a higher percentage of voters uncertain about his placement. These perceptions highlight the ideological divide between the two tickets.\n\n\u201cAlthough both Trump and Harris are similarly seen as conservative and liberal, respectively, Tim Walz is viewed by voters as a more moderate candidate,\u201d Wagner said. \u201cThat may change, but it does give the Democrats an opportunity to appeal to the center.\u201d\n\nParty Lines Define Satisfaction with U.S. Democracy\n\nThe survey found that 46% of Americans are satisfied with how democracy works in the U.S., while 38% are dissatisfied. However, the gap widens along party lines: 64% of Democrats express satisfaction compared to just 33% of Republicans.\n\nDespite these differences, most Americans still believe in democratic principles. A strong 74% agree that democracy is the best system of government. This view is more common among older voters (81% of those 50 and up) and Democrats (85%) than younger voters (65% of those under 50) and Republicans (65%).\n\n\u201cThe partisan and age splits on America\u2019s democratic quality are concerning,\u201d Kim said. \u201cA substantial portion of voters (38%) are either very dissatisfied or somewhat dissatisfied, which could have negative implications for the future of our democracy.\u201d\n\nSocial Media Influence Grows Among Young Voters\n\nA significant portion of respondents rely on cable news (35%) and national network TV (24%) for political information. However, a notable shift in voter consumption patterns is emerging, with social media and podcasts becoming increasingly popular, especially among younger voters (20% for ages 18-49 vs. 7% for those 50+).\n\n\u201cThis trend underscores the growing impact of social media influencers on public opinion,\u201d said Robert E. Gutsche, Jr., Ph.D., associate professor in FAU\u2019s School of Communication and Multimedia Studies. \u201cWith younger voters relying more on social media, the campaigns will have to reach them there.\u201d\n\nMethodology\n\nThe poll surveyed 929 registered U.S. voters from Aug. 23 to 25, using a combination of Interactive Voice Response and online panel methods. Conducted in both English and Spanish, the survey applied weights for gender, race, education and past vote. Party identification was self-reported. A likely voter screen was applied based on respondents\u2019 stated voting intentions. While a precise margin of error cannot be calculated due to the mixed methodology, a comparable probability sample of this size would have a margin of error of +/- 3.2 percentage points at the 95% confidence level.

        "text": "Trump adds ex-Democrats Gabbard and RFK Jr to his transition team\nTrump adds ex-Democrats Gabbard and RFK Jr to transition team\n\nReuters Ms Gabbard's endorsement of Trump is the culmination of a remarkable political journey\n\nDonald Trump has appointed Robert F Kennedy Jr and Tulsi Gabbard to his transition team, days after the two former Democrats endorsed his campaign. Ms Gabbard is a former congresswoman and military veteran who ran to be the Democratic candidate for the presidency in 2020, before distancing herself from the party. Mr Kennedy initially launched a bid to win the Democratic nomination this time around, but later ran as an independent before dropping out and endorsing Trump. Meanwhile, more than 200 Republicans who served under previous presidents and party leaders have given their backing to Trump's rival, Kamala Harris.\n\nIn an open letter, former staffers for George HW Bush and George W Bush, and Senators John McCain and Mitt Romney said another Trump administration would endanger American democracy. The Republicans wrote: \"Of course, we have plenty of honest, ideological disagreements with Vice President Harris and Gov Walz. That\u2019s to be expected. \"The alternative, however, is simply untenable.\"\n\nTransition team\n\nThe Trump campaign said Ms Gabbard and Mr Kennedy would serve as honorary transition team co-chairs, along with Trump's sons and running mate JD Vance. Presidential transition teams kick into action when a candidate is elected. They help select political appointees and set priorities for the incoming administration. Trump senior advisor Brian Hughes said that the endorsements of the two former Democrats show how the campaign was earning support \"across partisan lines\". \"We look forward to having their powerful voices on the team as we work to restore America\u2019s greatness,\" he said in a statement. On Monday, Trump welcomed Ms Gabbard, 43, to a stage in Detroit, in the key swing state of Michigan. Ms Gabbard, who represented Hawaii in Congress from 2013 to 2021, quit the Democratic Party in 2022, complaining of its \"wokeness\". She appeared alongside Trump to commemorate US service personnel killed in an attack in Afghanistan three years prior, using it as an opportunity to criticise the Biden administration. Thirteen US service members and more than 100 Afghans were killed during the suicide bombing at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul. The incident occurred as American troops made a chaotic withdrawal from the country, and the Taliban returned to power. Ms Gabbard made frequent criticisms of US military interventionism during her time in Congress. Appearing at Monday's event in Michigan, Ms Gabbard said she was appealing to Democrats, Republicans and independents alike to pick Trump at the ballot box in November - saying it was a matter of \"saving our country and serving the people\". Her official backing of Trump marks the culmination of a remarkable political journey over the last decade that began on the progressive left of the Democratic Party. She was the first Hindu member of the US Congress, going on to serve as vice-chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee - before resigning to endorse the 2016 presidential campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders. When Ms Gabbard ran for president in 2020, she championed liberal issues like government-run healthcare, free college tuition and gun control. But Joe Biden became the Democratic nominee that year, and went on to win the presidency. Ms Gabbard endorsed him, but quit the party two years later. She has since staked out conservative views on issues including abortion and transgender rights, and has become a regular and outspoken guest on Fox News. She has also been accused of spreading \"promoting Russian propaganda\" by officials in Ukraine. By early 2024, she was singing the praises of Mr Biden's rival, Trump, who will this time compete for the White House against Ms Harris. In the subsequent months, it was even speculated that Ms Gabbard could be in the frame as Trump's potential running mate for November - a role that ultimately went to Mr Vance.\n\nEnvironmentalists for Trump\n\nGetty Images Trump and RFK Jr appeared on stage together at a rally in Arizona\n\nMr Kennedy ended his independent presidential campaign on Friday and endorsed Trump, appearing alongside him at a rally in Arizona. The former president's allies have criticised both Mr Kennedy and Mr Gabbard over the years. Only four months ago, Trump called Mr Kennedy a \u201cRadical Left Lunatic\u201d who was \u201cfar more liberal than anyone running as a Democrat\". The two former Democrats are also known for being staunch environmentalists. Trump has promised to ramp up US fossil fuel production and regularly uses the slogan \"Drill, baby, drill!\" at his rallies. Top Democrats were quick to dismiss the endorsements from Ms Gabbard and Mr Kennedy. \u201cRather than focusing on earning the support of hardworking Americans, Trump is more fixated on winning the backing of extremists like Gabbard and RFK Jr \u2014 and they\u2019ll do nothing but weigh down his sinking ship of a campaign,\u201d the party's Rapid Response Director Alex Floyd said in a statement.",

        "text": "Prof. David Schultz: Generational Battle in the US Presidential Elections\nProf. David Schultz: Generational Battle in the US Presidential Elections\n\nU.S. Prof. David Schultz, an expert on U.S. elections, is a member of the MRU Justice LAB.\n\nJoe Biden\u2019s exit from the presidential race transformed the 2024 election from an intragenerational battle between him and Donald Trump to now an intergenerational campaign between Harris and Trump. The key to Harris\u2019 electoral college victory is adeptly playing this intergenerational game across five or six swing states where the election will come down to what 150,000 to 200,000 voters will do. While Harris needs to motivate voters across several generations, she especially needs Millennials and Gen Z.\n\nHarris\u2019 decision to select Minnesota governor Tim Walz as her vice-president indicates that she understands this generational contest, selecting a candidate potentially appealing across generations, but especially to an emerging Millennial and Gen Z voting bloc.\n\nThe 2024 presidential race is now a new campaign reset along many dimensions, including a generational contest between Trump and Harris. What we know is that across the five generations voting this November\u2014the Silents, Baby Boomers, GenX, Millennials, and GenZ\u2014there are profound policy preference differences, with the latter two generations being far more liberal on a range of issues including reproductive rights, voting rights, immigration, LGBTQ+ issues, gun regulation, and many other social issues.\n\nWe also know that in general the Republican and Democratic parties are divided along many dimensions, with there being a generational split with more Silents and Boomers favoring the former, while Gen X,, the Millennials, and GenZ favor the Democrats. But while Biden was a candidate, he was unable to motivate these generational voters, especially in the six or so swing states that will decide the election.\n\nHarris\u2019 choice of Walz challenges conventional wisdom of picking a political moderate in a swing state. Her selection of Walz\u2014a liberal from Minnesota\u2014suggests her campaign is going fully progressive, seeking to motivate these new generations. Its sets up a contrast to Donald Trump whose selection of JD Vance, sets up a clear liberal/conservative and generational voting divide. Both presidential candidates and parties are playing generational base politics.\n\nHarris may be better positioned to play this generational politics than Trump by the simple fact that generational ascendency and descendency are factors in this election. This election features the last gasp of the Silent generation in terms of its influence in American politics. Beginning in 2020 the Baby Boomers no longer were the largest generational voting bloc in America, and are now being eclipsed by the millennials and Gen Z, who in 2020, were 37% of the voting bloc. Now they're nearly 40%. The voters and constituencies Trump is appealing too are literally dying out, while for Harris her supporters are coming of age.\n\nThe Millennials and Gen Z view the two major parties as two stores with two different menus. They are not completely sold on either the Democratic or Republican parties and would like to see more mixing of the different items on the policy menus. This again suggests appealing to them by emphasizing themes of unity and cross-party policy. They are generally liberal on most issues, more centrist on fiscal issues. They remain worried about college education affordability, health care affordability, buying a home, as well as crime, the environment and guns.\n\nThe key to this election is both generating communications that appeal to specific generations, as well as cross generational themes. Each generation looks to different media for its sources of information, and successful campaigns need to use those media to target them with different symbols and themes based on defining events in their life that help them to continue to frame their perspective on the world. Generational politics is real. But it is real in the context at perhaps five or six swing states will decide this presidential election.\n\nIn Harris\u2019 acceptance speech she seemed to acknowledge the reality of the generality differences across the six or so swing states and where 150,000 to 200,000 voters will effectively determine the election. Moreover, her speech drew clear contrasts with Trump and also the tone of all the speeches on the final night of the Democratic National Convention was an effort to appeal to moderate or swing voters. Harris right now is playing the politics of 2024 well and is enjoying a bump in the polls that is putting her into the lead. If this lead is sustained for a few more weeks it may suggest that she has altered the course of the election and could be the next president of the United States.",

        "text": "Trump special counsel files new election interference indictment\nTrump faces revised 2020 election interference charges\n\nGetty Images\n\nUS prosecutors have issued revised charges against Donald Trump for the former president's alleged attempts to interfere in the 2020 election after losing the contest. The updated wording tries to navigate a Supreme Court ruling that presidents have broad immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts. The ruling had thrown this case into doubt. Trump denies accusations that he pressured officials to reverse the results, knowingly spread lies about election fraud and sought to exploit a riot at the US Capitol to delay the certification of Joe Biden's victory. It appears unlikely the case - and other criminal cases he faces - will reach court before the next election on 5 November.\n\nThe revised indictment, brought by Department of Justice (DoJ) Special Counsel Jack Smith, leaves in place the four crimes Trump is accused of committing: conspiracy to defraud the US, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, attempting to obstruct an official proceeding, and conspiracy against rights. But these now relate to Trump's status as a political candidate rather than a sitting president. Trump has partial immunity from prosecution, Supreme Court rules Trump has previously pleaded not guilty to all charges. He wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform that the fresh indictment was \"an effort to resurrect a 'dead' Witch Hunt\" and \"distract the American People\" from this year's election. He called for it to be \"dismissed IMMEDIATELY\". His campaign has not responded to a BBC request for comment. But a source close to his legal team told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, the second indictment \"was not a surprise\". \"This is what the government is supposed to do based on what the Supreme Court did,\" the source said. \"It doesn't change our position that we believe Smith's case is flawed and it should be dismissed.\"\n\nWhat's changed - and what hasn't?\n\nThe new charging document - which was slimmed down from 45 to 36 pages - re-works the language of the allegations to respond to last month's ruling on presidential immunity by the Supreme Court. It argues Trump acted as a private citizen - and not as president - when he undertook the alleged scheme to sway the election. \u201cThe defendant had no official responsibilities related to the certification proceeding, but he did have a personal interest as a candidate in being named the winner of the election,\u201d reads one new line in the indictment. Another new line refers to a lawsuit filed by Trump's campaign in Georgia. The old language said the suit was \u201cfiled in his name\u201d, but the updated indictment says it was \u201cfiled in his capacity as a candidate for president\u201d. The new document also appears to have removed the charges against Jeffrey Clark - a former DoJ official who played a key role in the so-called fake electors scheme, according to prosecutors. Mr Clark was not named in either indictment, but has been identified in the media through public records. The fresh indictment also drops the claim that Trump tried to pressure DoJ officials to work to overturn his defeat. The high court ruled Trump's direction to justice officials was not illegal. The special counsel's office said the superseding indictment had been presented to a new grand jury that had not previously heard evidence in the case. A grand jury is set up by a prosecutor to determine whether there is enough evidence to pursue a prosecution.\n\nThe new indictment leaves in place several key allegations against Trump, including that he attempted to persuade Vice-President Mike Pence to obstruct Mr Biden\u2019s election certification. That is despite the fact that conversations between Trump and Mr Pence would probably fall under the category of \"official\" acts, for which Trump has immunity from prosecution, according to the Supreme Court ruling. The revised indictment showed that Mr Smith interpreted the Supreme Court ruling to mean that his case could still move forward, said Prof Daniel Richman, a constitutional law expert at Columbia Law School. But whether it would satisfy the Supreme Court's presidential immunity framework remained unclear, Prof Richman told the BBC. \"The court was painfully vague as to what private conduct done by a president can be charged criminally,\" he said.\n\nReuters Trump is accused of trying to thwart Joe Biden's victory at the last election - including by exploiting a riot at the US Capitol on 6 January 2021\n\nTrump's other legal issues\n\nThe revised indictment would not necessarily expedite the case, Prof Richman said. He doubted it would be heard before the 2024 election. The CBS News source close to Trump's legal team said the former president's lawyers would ask for more time to prepare for the case. They said this would likely delay the start of the trial if the judge agreed. This case came together after Mr Smith was appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland in 2022 to oversee two federal investigations into Trump: the election interference case and another case in which the ex-president has been accused of taking classified documents back to his Florida home after leaving office. On Monday, Mr Smith\u2019s team appealed against the decision of a Florida judge to dismiss the latter case. Judge Aileen Cannon had done so on the grounds that the mere existence of special counsels violated the US Constitution. Mr Smith argued the judge's view \"deviated\" from legal precedent. A guide to Trump's criminal cases Both cases face uncertain futures after the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark decision. The same is true of a separate case in Georgia, in which Trump and 18 other defendants are also accused of criminally conspiring to overturn his narrow defeat in 2020. He has pleaded not guilty, and a trial date has not been set. Meanwhile, Trump awaits sentencing after being convicted in New York in May of falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments made to a porn star. If Trump defeats Democratic candidate Kamala Harris in November, he is widely expected to order officials to drop all the remaining federal charges that he faces.",
