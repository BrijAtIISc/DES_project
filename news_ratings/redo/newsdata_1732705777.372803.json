On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve agreed.\n\nGiven that the US central bank, and its chair Jerome Powell, pride themselves on making decisions removed from political influences and considerations, the move to decisively lower a key lending rate offers an impartial affirmation that inflation is now firmly under control and a top concern for economic policymakers is ensuring continued economic growth.\n\nAlthough most Americans would not be able to pick Mr Powell out of a crowd or explain the duties of the Federal Reserve, the interest rate change will shape media coverage of the US economy in the final two months of this presidential campaign.\n\nThe larger-than-expected cut could also trigger another stock market boom and will lead to substantive drops in interest rates \u2013 on credit cards, car loans and, indirectly, home mortgages \u2013 that will be felt by consumers across the nation.\n\nAll of that is good news for Kamala Harris\u2019s presidential campaign, given that voter concern about the economy have weighed on the electoral prospects for the incumbent vice-president and, before he abandoned his re-election bid, President Joe Biden.",

They can, and must, form their own consciences about whom they should be voting for in their elections.\"\n\n\"You reporters want to get me into trouble. No thank you. Next question.\"\n\n\"The issues facing the people of the United States are grave and I encourage the Catholics of that great country to search their hearts, do what they can to build a politics that is worthy of the human person, one that leaves no one behind, a politics focused on the common good, with a special concern for the poor. That is the only political guidance offered in the Gospels so it is the only political advice I can offer.\"\n\nAny of these answers would have been preferable to what the Holy Father did say during the press conference Sept. 13, on the flight back from Asia.\n\nThe pope is known for his spicy way of saying things. And he speaks his mind. There are times, however, when it is better to say nothing than to throw out statements that sound like they were designed to make the headlines. Which they sure did.\n\nThe real problem came in the follow-up question from CBS News' Anna Matranga, who asked, \"In your opinion, Your Holiness, are there circumstances in which it is morally permissible to vote for a candidate who is in favor of abortion?\"\n\nHe replied, \"In political morality, it is generally said that not voting is ugly, it's not good. One must vote. And one must choose the lesser evil. Which is the lesser evil? That lady or that gentleman? I don't know; each person must think and decide according to their own conscience.\"\n\nThe phrase \"one must choose the lesser evil\" misunderstands the choice facing the American people. As Catholics, we believe abortion is a grave evil. No one should be surprised that the pope thinks so. But we are choosing candidates, not issues, when we vote.",

        "text": "Trump and Harris' views on inflation, according to their records and what they've said\nWhy are prices still high if the inflation rate is dropping?\n\nInflation is consistently a top issue ahead of the 2024 presidential election \u2014 in CBS News' polling in mid-August, 76% of registered voters said it was a major factor in their choice for president \u2014 and they want to know how nominees Donald Trump and Kamala Harris would address it.\n\nInflation \u2014 the rate of an increase in the price of goods and services over time \u2014 has hollowed out many voters' wallets and made it tougher for Americans to save. According to the Federal Reserve, inflation averaged 1.9% a year from 2017 to 2021 when Trump was president.\n\nThough inflation recently cooled to a three-year low of 2.5%, it's on track to average 5% a year during the Biden administration.\n\nNow, Americans shopping for housing must have an annual income of $106,500 in order to comfortably afford a typical home in the U.S., a sharp increase over the $59,000 they would have needed when Trump was president, thanks to rising home prices and high interest rates.\n\nThe price of groceries also went up during Mr. Biden's first three years in office, increasing by 20% over that period.\n\nInflation poses a challenge politically, too, because once prices go up, they rarely come down again. The International Monetary Fund explains, \"Although high inflation hurts an economy, deflation, or falling prices, is not desirable either. When prices are falling, consumers delay making purchases if they can, anticipating lower prices in the future.\" This results in less economic activity and lower growth.\n\nThe Federal Reserve, which sets monetary policy, has been trying to give the nation a \"soft landing.\" Its target inflation rate is 2%.\n\nTrump blames the Biden administration for high inflation, claiming during the debate with Harris, \"We have inflation like very few people have ever seen before. Probably the worst in our nation's history.\" But while it did reach a 40-year high of 8% in 2022, in the modern era, inflation peaked at 13.5% in 1980.\n\nTrump has said that he wants a more direct role in how the Federal Reserve sets its interest rates, telling reporters in August, \"I feel the president should have at least (a) say in there. I think that in my case, I made a lot of money, I was very successful, and I think I have a better instinct than in many cases, people that would be on the Federal Reserve or the chairman.\"\n\nBut he also told Bloomberg in an interview that he would not fire Fed Chairman Jerome Powell before his term ends in 2026.\n\nTwo years ago, Congress passed and President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act, broad legislation that aimed to lower drug prices and spur investments in climate and domestic energy. Republicans say the law isn't what's helped bring down inflation, and they claim the government spending the Biden administration injected to the economy has had the opposite effect.\n\nThe Biden administration has been tackling the effects of inflation, acknowledging the higher cost of key needs like housing, groceries and medication and has worked on easing some of the financial burden on Americans. Harris' economic plans, though broad, suggest she would continue and expand this approach.\n\nHarris says she'd help first-time home buyers and tackle price gouging\n\nHarris proposes addressing higher prices at the grocery store by attacking what she says is price gouging by large grocery corporations. Harris says she wants to target businesses that aren't \"playing by the rules\" and ensure there's competition in the industry to bring down costs.\n\nEconomists say the reasons behind higher prices at the grocery store are more complex than grocers trying to maximize profits. They point to supply-chain disruptions and higher labor costs, and other factors \u2014 such as record-low cattle numbers \u2014 have driven up beef prices.\n\nWage gains have outpaced inflation since May 2023, although many voters say they don't feel that, or that isn't their reality. Inflation has been a worldwide phenomenon, in part due to the pandemic's impact on global supply chains.\n\nHarris also proposes tackling higher prices with an offer of up to $25,000 in assistance for many first-time homebuyers.\n\nBut Edward Pinto, co-director of the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, told CBS News that while down payment assistance would help some home shoppers instantly, the move would drive up prices in census tracts where a sizable portion of buyers receive assistance. When the Obama administration lowered the Federal Housing Administration mortgage insurance premium, a study by AEI found that once about 20% of homebuyers in a census tract were FHA buyers, home prices increased by an average of 4%. Pinto expects the effect to be even greater with $25,000 in governmental down payment assistance.\n\n\"We're still working through the numbers, but I think it's safe to say it would be at least about a 5% price in home prices in the census tracts where a sizable portion of the people\" \u2014 around 22% \u2014 \"are getting this first-time buyer tax credit,\" Pinto said.\n\nTrump tariffs\n\nTrump consistently criticizes the Biden-Harris administration for record-high inflation, but Trump himself has offered few proposals on lowering prices.\n\nHe has said he wants to impose tariffs of 60% on Chinese imports and 10% to 20% on goods from other foreign countries, although campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt later said that what's been reported is wrong, and Trump \"has not settled on a definitive number for either particular tariff. He has floated multiple different numbers.\"\n\n\"I had tariffs, and yet I had no inflation,\" Trump said during the debate in Philadelphia. \"Look, we've had a terrible economy because inflation \u2014 which is really known as a country-buster \u2014 it breaks up countries.\"\n\nA tariff hike to 60% on Chinese imports and 10 to 20% on all other foreign imports would cost middle-class families between $1,500 and $2,500 more a year, according to estimates by the Center for American Progress and the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\nInflation predictions under Trump or Harris presidency\n\nIn August, Moody's Analytics released a report on the macroeconomic impacts of a Trump or Harris victory. Earlier this year, Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, told CBS MoneyWatch at the time that if consumers \"are upset now, they will be hopping mad a year from now\" about inflation if Trump wins and enacts his policies.\n\nMoody's estimates that a Republican election sweep in Congress and the White House would increase the annual inflation rate to 3.5% in 2025, a slight acceleration from 3%. Under Harris and a divided Congress \u2014 since the House is unlikely to return to Democratic control \u2014 Moody's estimates inflation would lower to 2% in summer 2025.\n\ncontributed to this report.",

        "text": "Arizona's growing political influence, explained by a U of A political scientist\nArizona's political landscape is evolving, and the 2024 presidential election could mark a pivotal moment for the state. Lisa M. Sanchez, assistant professor in the University of Arizona School of Government and Public Policy, sees Arizona's growing population, diversity and shifting demographics as key factors in its transformation into a contentious political battleground.\n\nImage Lisa M. Sanchez\n\nAs Republicans and Democrats vie for control, the state's changing electorate is set to play a critical role in shaping the national outcome.\n\n\"Arizona is a shifting political landscape,\" Sanchez said. \"Historically, the state was sort of an easy win for conservatives. Now that we've seen an influx in population \u2013 and especially in the Latino community \u2013 we are starting to see Arizona as a state that is not so assured. That's a good thing for Democrats because they know the electoral content will matter, but it's a bad thing for Republicans who had seen the state as 'in the bag.' It's not.\"\n\nSanchez researches ethno-racial disparities in American politics and investigates key factors driving political participation across the country, with a focus on Latino voters and Congressional politics. Her recent work analyzes the adoption of immigration policies in American states, the prevalence of cross-racial ties among Americans of all racial and ethnic backgrounds, and the relationship between a growing Latino population and its electoral impact.\n\nThe United States Census Bureau recorded nearly 6.4 million Arizonans in 2010, and the Arizona Secretary of State lists 3.1 million registered voters that year. The Arizona Office of Economic Opportunity estimates Arizona's 2024 population to be roughly 7.6 million, and more than 4.1 million Arizonans were registered to vote at the time of the 2024 primary election. Of those 4.1 million, just over 1.4 million were registered as Republicans, 1.1 million as Democrats, nearly 1.4 million as Independent and more than 30,000 as Libertarians.\n\nWhile Arizona's voter roll and influence on elections has grown over the years, Sanchez said the issues that send voters to the ballot box remain relatively unchanged. Chief among those concerns, she said, is the economy \u2013 especially considering Phoenix is one of the fastest-growing cities in the United States.\n\nPeople often move to Arizona to pursue economic opportunities in a burgeoning economy and will keep their budgets in mind when voting for the next president, Sanchez said.\n\n\"It is very interesting to see the Kamala Harris campaign's outreach on economic issues,\" Sanchez said. \"She's been using the terminology of an 'Opportunity Economy.' I think that's a really wise decision on her part, especially when it comes to Latinos, many of whom have grown up with a high emphasis on the American Dream ethos and have some of the highest adherence to the idea that the American Dream is still alive. Her using that terminology \u2013 I don't think that's an accident.\"\n\nDonald Trump, on the other hand, takes a different approach.\n\n\"Trump is really making the case that voters haven't done great under a Biden economy, and that he is a businessman,\" Sanchez said. \"For many white voters, that plays really well; they are already thinking that business is where solutions are, and so they have high hopes. Trump makes that case very well, particularly in Arizona where small businesses are a really important part of the economy.\"\n\nAside from the economy, Sanchez said that reproductive rights and abortion access; immigration and border security; and educational attainment remain important issues for Arizona voters, regardless of race, nationality, gender or party affiliation.\n\nSanchez noted that increased political participation by Arizona's Latino population is driven, in part, by the fact that more women of Hispanic and Latino descent are heading to the polls, at a time when they are also taking on new roles at home.\n\n\"Latinas are increasingly heads of households,\" Sanchez said. \"When we look at the economic data, there are higher levels of engagement in the labor market, and they are starting to run more and more households for the first time. Hispanic women are in the driver's seat.\"",

        "text": "Christian Voters Will Play an Outsized Role in the US Election\nThis brief is part of \u201cElection 2024: Policy Playbook,\u201d a series by Rice University and the Baker Institute that offers critical context, analysis, and recommendations to inform policymaking in the United States and Texas.\n\nThe Big Picture\n\nReligion\u2019s influence in U.S. politics has surged, and Christian voters may have a greater impact on 2024\u2019s election results than ever before.\n\nTwo-thirds of Americans now identify as Christian, with an estimated 55% \u201cpracticing Christians,\u201d and often align with more conservative positions.\n\nPracticing Christians are much more likely to vote compared to other eligible voters \u2014 giving them an outsized influence on election outcomes.\n\nPracticing Christians are more likely to vote Republican than other eligible voters, except for Black Christians.\n\nSummarizing the Issue\n\nSince the 1960s, the link between religion, race, and voting patterns has intensified. Researchers today can use a person\u2019s specific religion and racial identities to determine voting behavior with significant accuracy. These insights are proving to be valuable tools for election analysts:\n\nAccording to Gallup , as of March 2024, two-thirds of adult Americans identify as Christian (Protestant, Catholic, Orthodox, or other another denomination), while just 7% of adult Americans identify with another religion.\n\nOf those who identify as Christian, analysis shows that 55% are practicing, meaning they self-identify as Christian, say faith is important in their lives, and attend church at least monthly. Thus, at least one-third of adult Americans are practicing Christians.\n\nAs the chart below indicates, Christian voting patterns vary by race \u2014 another powerful shaper of U.S. voting patterns.\n\nThe Christian Vote by Race\n\nThe percentage of practicing Christians who failed to vote in the 2016 presidential election is significantly less than for the general voting-eligible public, although this effect varies across each of the four major racial groups, as shown in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1 \u2014 Percentage of Eligible Adults Not Voting in the 2016 Presidential Election, By Race and Religion\n\nSource: Data courtesy of the Barna Group. Chart sourced from \u201cReligion, Race, and Justice Survey: 2020,\u201d August 2020.\n\nChristianity and Political Affiliation\n\nChristianity increases the probability of voting Republican, except for African Americans. Consider the 2016 presidential election, when practicing Christians were seemingly torn as to whether to vote for Donald Trump. He clearly wasn\u2019t \u201cone of them,\u201d there were \u201cNever Trump\u201d movements, and there were significant questions within Christian communities about his moral and ethical behaviors. Thus, the 2016 election serves as an excellent test of the impact of Christianity on presidential elections. Figure 2 compares all voting-eligible adults (divided by race) to practicing Christians as well as its evangelical subset:\n\nFigure 2 \u2014 Percentage of Adults Voters Who Voted for Donald Trump in the 2016 Presidential Election, by Race and Religion\n\nSource: Data courtesy of the Barna Group. Chart sourced from \u201cReligion, Race, and Justice Survey: 2020,\u201d August 2020.\n\nAs Figure 2 shows, a minority of the general voting population voted for Donald Trump in each racial category. But apart from African Americans \u2014 whose voting is primarily shaped by race rather than by the interaction of religion and race \u2014 the impact Christianity has on voting behavior is clearly significant. Hispanic practicing Christians are 38% more likely to have voted for Donald Trump than the general population of Hispanic voters. When looking just at evangelical Hispanics, the majority (57%) cast their vote for Trump. The pattern for Asian and white voters is even stronger. Only one-fourth of general Asian voters voted for Trump, but over half of Asian practicing Christians did (57%). And for Asian evangelicals, that figure climbs close to two-thirds. For white voters, a slight minority voted for Trump (48%), but for white practicing Christians, two-thirds cast their vote for him. And for white evangelicals, 80% voted for Donald Trump, just as they did in the 2020 election.\n\nAn Outsized Impact on Elections\n\nThe implication of these voting patterns is significant: Because practicing Christians form a sizable portion of the American electorate and vote at a much higher rate than other adults, they have an outsized influence on election outcomes beyond their numbers. According to current analysis, that influence includes a significantly increased likelihood that their turnout will primarily benefit Republican candidates. African American Christians are the exception as they vote overwhelmingly for Democratic candidates, regardless of religious commitments.\n\nWhy does this pattern occur? Several factors contribute to it, but one factor is the tie between Christian religious or community commitments and the spectrum of conservativism. My colleague and I asked a nationally representative sample of adults a series of questions about their views on social, moral, economic, and government issues. Figure 3 shows the average percentage of adults, by race and religion, who said that they held mostly conservative or very conservative views on these issues.\n\nFigure 3 \u2014 Average Percentage of Voters Who Identify as Mostly or Very Conservative on Social, Economic, and Government Authority Issues\n\nSource: Data courtesy of the Barna Group. Chart sourced from \u201cReligion, Race, and Justice Survey: 2020,\u201d August 2020.\n\nStrikingly, a comparison of Figures 2 and 3 shows a close correlation between how Christian voters identify on issues, regardless of affiliation, and how they actually vote. This mirroring of the data suggests that religion and religious communities shape a web of intertwined, ostensibly nonreligious factors that affect voting patterns, such as views on economics, government authority, fiscal responsibility, and social issues.\n\nExpert Analysis\n\nDue to significant changes in immigration laws (which opened the door to greater numbers of non-European immigrants) and several prominent social movements (such as those focusing on civil rights, feminism, and greater church/state separation), the 1960s gave rise to momentous social changes. America became far more diverse and pluralistic, and challenges to the status quo were frequent.\n\nFollowing the 1960s, the link between religion, race, and politics began to crystallize. With movements such as Jerry Falwell\u2019s Moral Majority beginning in the late 1970s, how Christians viewed political issues outside of their religious communities became increasingly defined or even proscribed \u2014 including their views on the obligation to vote and who to vote for.\n\nThrough what is now several decades of change \u2014 including a growing tendency of people to self-identify with specific communities and increasing polarization between these groups \u2014 Christianity has become wound together with a host of political issues and linked with clear voting patterns. Practicing Christians largely vote Republican. This effect is strongest for white Americans, followed closely by Asian Americans. Hispanic Americans, too, are more likely to vote Republican if they are practicing Christians, though only in the majority if they identify specifically as evangelicals. African Americans are the exception to this pattern as they have overwhelmingly voted Democratic since the 1960s, whether they are practicing Christians or not. For this group, race is a far more important factor than the interaction of religion and race.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nReligion is a potent factor in elections, and the role of Christianity in 2024\u2019s political landscape will be significant. With the rise of newer organized movements, such as Christian nationalism, and the impact of polarized news and social media outlets, the voting behaviors of practicing Christians may have an even more pronounced impact on results than in past election cycles.\n\nThis material may be quoted or reproduced without prior permission, provided appropriate credit is given to the author and Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute for Public Policy.

But U.S. citizens are not the only ones whose lives will be shaped by the outcome of our upcoming election.\n\nI was recently in Germany, and the thing I found most surprising about my trip was just how much Germans seemed to know about our political system, and our upcoming election. I saw it on the news. I read it in the papers. I heard it in conversations at restaurants, heck I was asked about it several times. I came home wanting to understand why, and to get a peek at what this high-stakes American election means to the rest of the world.\n\nI\u2019m Gabrielle Sierra, and this is Why It Matters. Today, we use the lens of Germany to examine why the U.S. election matters abroad.\n\nGabrielle SIERRA: Let's dive into it. While here, we in the U.S. are glued to election coverage, what do everyday Germans think about the U.S. election and what does it mean to them?\n\nLiana FIX: For an everyday German, the U.S. elections do matter. And that's something that in the United States, many people forget that what happens in the United States is paid attention to by the entire world and especially in Europe.\n\nThis is Liana Fix, CFR\u2019s fellow for Europe and friend of the pod. She\u2019s a native Berliner, an expert on German and European policy, and a frequent contributor to international and German media.\n\nFIX: So, what Germans and Europeans know about U.S. elections is entirely not comparable to what you as Americans usually know about European elections. I mean, that's the case for multiple reasons because the United States is so important economically, politically. Especially now with Russia's war against Ukraine, the United States matters as a protector of Europe. So, the US elections are possibly the most important news event for Germany towards the end of the year.\n\n\n\nStefan KORNELIUS: America matters, and that's the most important thing for us. America's a huge country, with a huge impact on world affairs, European affairs, global affairs.\n\nThis is Stefan Kornelius. He\u2019s the political editor of S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, which is Germany's second largest daily newspaper.\n\nKORNELIUS: I fully understand if you live in Kansas or South Dakota, Europe is so far away. It's even further away than Washington, and Washington is far away already. But don\u2019t be fooled. World affairs do affect domestic affairs, do affect your standing in the world. It goes down to the deepest, deepest roots of our democracies, of our way of life. We are talking about not only one election cycle. We are talking about a really historic moment. And the entire history of a country is on the line.\n\nQuick history lesson here, so the United States\u2019 has been Germany\u2019s most important ally since World War II. After that war ended, then U.S. President Harry Truman began implementing the Marshall Plan. It was a program that spent $13 billion, or $150 billion in today\u2019s market, to rebuild Europe, including a destroyed Germany.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/o63ZbMcEnWU?si=R-HlT8ZADPxla0f8&t=13\n\nHarry S. Truman/British Movietone: The signing of this act is a momentous occasion in the world\u2019s quest for enduring peace. This measure is America\u2019s answer to the challenge facing the free world today.\n\nOver the past seventy years, that relationship with Germany has only grown both economically and militarily. Germany is now the United States\u2019 fifth largest trading partner in the world, and top trading partner in Europe. As a member of organizations like the Group of 7 and NATO, Germany\u2019s role in upholding the global balance of power is significant, and directly tied to its relationship with the United States.\n\nWe\u2019ll dive more into that later, but for now, I really wanted to understand more about what everyday Germans thought about the U.S. election. So we sent Liana on a fact finding mission in Berlin, speaking to people about the U.S. election and how read-in they are.\n\nSIERRA: Do you think there's any chance that a single person you would've spoken to didn't know who was running in the U.S. elections or that our elections were coming up?\n\nFIX: No, I don't think so. Everyone knew about it. Everyone knew the candidates.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UzDYjzUh3o\n\nTagesschau:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9I7dbD5Gao\n\nTagesspiegel:\n\nFIX: And that gives you a clear picture of just how relevant the U.S. elections and how much time in German news programs the U.S. elections take on.\n\nSIERRA: Okay tell me more about your reporting - where were you, who did you talk to, and I\u2019m curious, how much influence Germans think the U.S. and this election has on their lives?\n\nFIX: I was in Berlin, but in the eastern part of Berlin. And I do think it's interesting because this division between West and East Germany is still there even so many years after German reunification in 1990. So, what people in East Germany think about the U.S. elections might be slightly different than what people in West Germany think. In West Germany, many West Germans are very critical of Donald Trump as a presidential candidate. In East Germany, I got some interesting voices. For example, I talked to a lady in her 60s who told me that actually she follows very closely what happens in the United States, but that she's not entirely against Trump because she has friends who live in America and who don't think that everything is bad about Trump. And she said, because she's a mother, she doesn't want rearmament. And although Trump will not end the wars immediately, that's what she said, she thinks perhaps there might be a rapprochement between Trump and Putin both getting closer to each other and she says it's not clear whether that's good or bad, that's still up for debate. And so, the U.S. elections from the perspective of those East Berliners I talked to are a question that is framed as a big question of world order, of the world being in danger. Let me quote someone else I talked to Rolph, he's in his 50s. He said he would prefer Harris to Trump, because if Trump gets elected, all what is happening in the world will become more dangerous. And another lady I talked to, Annemarie, she's 88 years old. She said, \"I'm afraid of war and Trump would be terrible for Germany.\" So war and peace is big on the minds of Germans and the U.S. elections seem to be related to that.\n\nSIERRA: Obviously Germans are not a monolith - can you tell me a bit more about how German views on the U.S. election break down across different groups?\n\nFIX: It matters in particular when it comes to the party that you are affiliated with. So, those who vote for the traditional German parties like the social democrats or the conservatives or the green parties are probably much more likely to be critical of Donald Trump and more supportive of Kamala Harris. But if you look at those who are more leaning towards left-wing and right-wing populists, you can also see that those are less critical of Donald Trump as a candidate and the potential president again of the United States.\n\nEarlier this month, the far-right party Alternative for Germany won the most votes in the eastern state of Thuringia, marking it the first victory for a German far-right party in a regional election since World War II.\n\nFIX: So we had two regional elections in Germany, in Saxony and in Thuringia. And the surprising results, perhaps not so surprising for those observing German politics, but still for the outside world is that the AfD has become the strongest political actor in one German state Thuringia, and the second strongest in the other. So the extreme right AFD is very critical of support for Ukraine, for example, they're more open to any Russia links, and they basically want to have Germany out of the west, so they are not as supportive of the Transatlantic Alliance and of NATO as the Germany centrist parties. So just on a political level, it's definitely more extreme in its right wing positions than, let's say, Donald Trump is as a populist, right, but obviously they are taking some cues from our elections, from Donald Trump about putting your own country first, which is big on the agenda of the AfD. They're always arguing, why should we care about other Europeans? Why should we care about Ukraine? Why don't we put our own country first? So there is a sense of nationalism and of re-nationalization in Germany, which is particularly sensitive because of its second World War history. Those populists actually learn from U.S. elections the way how U.S. elections are conducted. Not only the candidates and the outcome, but the level of populism or the level of sobriety in elections influences how elections in Germany and how campaigns and parties think about elections in Germany and in Europe too. The U.S. has not only hard power, it has a huge amount of soft power in Europe.\n\nSIERRA: How do you think this election is different or similar to elections in the past in terms of mobilizing people around the world?\n\nFIX: I think the U.S. elections can mobilize not only U.S. Americans obviously, but the way how the election has been energized by Kamala Harris coming back into the fold is so inspiring that it also has repercussions in Europe. So, we see on social media many memes about Kamala Harris that are repeated from the United States. You see many terms like brat for example, that are analyzed in German, prominent, sophisticated German newspapers who write long articles about why this is a big thing. So, this is in the same way that the election of Barack Obama had an electrifying effect on Europeans, perhaps it could be repeated with Kamala Harris.\n\nSIERRA: I have to ask you, is there a super long word in German for \u2018brat summer\u2019?\n\nFIX: Well, I could come up with one.\n\nSIERRA: Let's do it. Right now.\n\nFIX: Germans are very good at this. Well I would say it\u2019s \u2018Im Sommer die Macht \u00fcbernehmenden G\u00f6ren\u2019 which translates to \u2018the brats took over power in the summer.\u2019\n\nGermany\u2019s focus on the U.S. - whether its brat summer or nuclear security - isn\u2019t new.\n\nGermany sent troops to support the American war effort after the United States invaded Afghanistan in 2001. In fact, Germany was one of the first countries to send its own troops to support the United States, and sustained that effort despite European antagonism to the U.S. role in the Iraq war. And over the course of twenty years, Germany sent more than 90,000 members of its armed forces to the country, making it the second-largest troop provider after the United States. And of course most recently, the U.S. and Germany continue to stand together with the West in supporting Ukraine.\n\nAnd while we\u2019re looking at the importance of U.S. elections in Germany, many other European nations - France, the UK, you name it - are just as concerned about how the election will affect their future.\n\nKORNELIUS: Watching the world right now, we're all dismayed, we're all confused about those various power bases. We do see the Chinese coming up in huge force, really investing a lot to get their foothold in Europe, trying to buy their way in. Russia provoking war, waging war, and destroying international order which rests on the idea of rules and regulations. And now there's the balancer in this game, of big powers, and that's the United States. Whenever you create a vacuum, whenever the United States decides not to be part of that game, this will be filled immediately, and the players who fill it will be the bad guys.\n\nSIERRA: Is there anything specific about Germany that you think makes people so attuned to the U.S. election?\n\nKORNELIUS: Well, there's a historic knot between the United States and Germany. And this is often forgotten in the United States, how much American interest is rooted in Germany, how much of America's self-perception and its power, basically, in the world, has to do with the country having its footprint in Europe. Being a superpower isn't decided in Washington alone. It's being decided on how many friends you have, how many alliances you hold, how many give and takes you do have. And whether you have loyal allies, which are basically on your side politically, and secondly, whether you can count on America as being an ally.\n\nGermany is the largest European economy in the NATO alliance, which could be why one of the most prominent national security fears that Germans have is that Donald Trump would abandon NATO, the alliance that the United States created with Canada and ten European countries in 1949.\n\nAs president, Trump threatened to deny the protection of NATO allies if countries failed to spend 2 percent of their GDP on defense. And on the campaign trail, he has only continued to double down on this threat.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ZoMIwdqypJk?si=_7kwW3KJoqDy9i9g&t=40\n\nAP Archive: One of the presidents of a big country stood up and said, \u201cWell sir, if we don\u2019t pay and we\u2019re attacked by Russia, will you protect us.\u201d I said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t pay. You\u2019re a delinquent.\u201d I said, \u201cYes, let\u2019s say that happened. No, I would not protect you. In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want. You gotta pay, you gotta pay your bills.\u201d\n\nFIX: After World War II, NATO was basically the organization that brought Europe together in a peaceful way. So, the hegemony of the United States, because obviously the United States is the most important contributor to NATO, prevented that we had a return of these kinds of tensions and rivalries between France and Germany and other European countries that led to the two World Wars that we have seen. So, just historically, NATO and the big U.S. role in NATO has brought peace to the European continent, and that's not a small deed. The second function that NATO always had throughout the Cold War was to defend Europe against the Soviet Union and against Soviet aggression and to prevent that the Soviet Union could further advance into Europe. Now, this has obviously received an update by 2022, which doesn't sound too different from Cold War times, because now the main role of NATO in Europe is to support Ukraine and to prevent that Russia attacks any NATO member in Europe. So, all NATO members have promised each other if one of us is attacked, everyone will come to the help. That's especially important for Europeans because let's say if Poland gets attacked, it doesn't really matter for Poland if the Baltic States come to help Poland or Germany does, but it matters if the United States does. So, for Europeans, the promise of NATO is the promise of U.S. protection primarily. That is so important for Europeans, because for a long time, they have neglected their own protection and that means that today they could not survive in a land war against Russia, for example, without the help of the United States. There's so many gaps for Europeans that there's no plan B, any plan B would take a decade at least and cost so much money that Europeans would have to reduce, for example, social welfare, which is apparently very important to Europeans and instead invest massively in defense.\n\nSIERRA: How might the results of the election impact the NATO alliance?\n\nKORNELIUS: Well, there is, in both parties, a clearly stated goal that Europe has to take much more responsibility on its own.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWCDhumBEaw\n\nBarack Obama/The Telegraph: Our freedom isn\u2019t free, and we\u2019ve gotta be willing to pay for the assets, the personnel, the training, that\u2019s required to make sure we have a credible NATO force and an effective deterrent force.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Cm8Su-bbmw\n\nDonald Trump/BBC News: I have been very very direct with Secretary Stoltenberg and members of the alliance in saying that NATO members must finally contribute their fair share and meet their financial obligations.\n\nKORNELIUS: They have to pay up for their security. Which I think countries do. If you watch the increase of defense spending over the past months, it's breathtaking. There is almost no nation anymore in Europe which doesn't pay at least 2 percent of its gross-national product for defense. Those numbers will increase. The efforts which have been made to be self-reliant in military production, in procurement, in defense spending are just amazing.\n\nThat\u2019s a major change from just two years ago, when only six out of NATO\u2019s thirty countries spent more than 2 percent of GDP on defense. But this year, twenty-three project that they will do so. And although Germany has not reached that level since the 90s, this year they are projected to hit NATO\u2019s defense spending target. Still, the United States and some European countries have proposed raising the benchmark to two and a half, or even three percent.\n\nKORNELIUS: This is due to the sheer necessity. We do feel threat from Russia, especially those countries which are bordering Russia. We do feel the impact of Ukrainian refugees mostly coming to Germany for various reasons. There's a huge instability in European societies. And also, kind of huge fear. And if this fear is unleashed, then it might lead to domestic unrest. It might lead to countries rallying against each other. So you look for people to blame. In this very small pattern which Europe provides, nation states might very easily turn into enemies.\n\nFIX: Then the question of financing comes in. The European Union, especially Germany, have been very insistent on not taking on too much debt completely in contrast to the United States. No one in the United States understands why Europeans are so strict about this, but it's sort of a lesson about the financial crisis and so on, where especially Germany, the Netherlands and so on, said, \"Well, you can't just spend without end and just use debt.\n\nBeyond Donald Trump\u2019s threats to abandon NATO, he\u2019s also proposed a fiscal plan that could dent America\u2019s economic relationship with its allies. It includes a universal tariff on imports which could profoundly affect the trade relationship with Germany, increasing the price of the approximate $150 billion worth of goods Washington imports from Berlin. Cars and medicine make up about a quarter of that total.\n\nSIERRA: Do you think a Trump election would bring Europeans closer together, or drive them further apart?\n\nKORNELIUS: It'll go both ways. Donald Trump has clearly stated his aims with Europe. He thinks we are those guys who live off American wealth and American security. So this leads to a huge rallying effect of most European major powers, which are hanging in this together, and are inclined to build up their own defense against Russia, and their own answer to Donald Trump. However, there are European nations which are sympathetic to Trump. Most of all, this is Hungary, which we all do see with Viktor Orban. He can destabilize the European Union. He has a vote in the European Union. He can stop decision making in the European Union by raising his veto. Also, the Slovaks have the same problem. All small countries, all depending on European money/German money. And this kind of behavior might force Europe to be much more harsher within its own ranks. Yes, Donald Trump will have an impact. And this impact will be in splintering, in driving the European Union apart.\n\nAn example of this splintering is Poland, which shares a close to 150 mile border with Russia. And on the other side of Poland is Germany, which shares a 290 mile border. In 2020, Poland was the only European country surveyed by Pew where a majority of people had a positive view of then President Trump.\n\nFIX: In Poland, there's a little bit of a different attitude, and that is because Poland is now the frontline state. So, they care about security above everything. But Poland also had a particular relationship with Donald Trump in his first term, which was a better relationship than Germany had. So, for example, Poland would hope that the United States would place more soldiers, more weapons, more missiles in Poland as a protection against Russia, and therefore thinks it has a kind of special relationship with the potential Donald Trump if he returns to the White House. And this kind of idea of a special relationship with Donald Trump is what Poland banks on and that's why they hope that it will not become as bad as many fear if Donald Trump returns.\n\nSIERRA: I\u2019m curious now how Europeans think about President Biden, because he dropped out of the presidential race in July. Is he considered a lame duck on the global stage? You know, how will this impact his relationship with EU leaders for the remainder of his term and even leading up to the election?\n\nKORNELIUS: President Biden has a long record of being a foreign policy mind, of just basically living for foreign policy, and especially transatlantic relations. Nobody questions his ability to govern, to do the right decisions, even if you saw his dismal performance now during the campaign and we all know for better that he has good reason to have dropped out and it's really reinvigorated the campaign, and our perspectives. Nevertheless, Joe Biden will be serving the term. And there is no questioning from the European side that he will not be able to. But we do see now a shifting point. He's the last of a generation which was basically brought up in the Cold War Era, which was highly influenced by World War II. And Kamala Harris, from California, hasn't got that much European links and roots, definitely will bring in a new era.\n\nSIERRA: Can Kamala Harris maintain the longstanding relationships with EU and Ukrainian leaders that Biden has emphasized as a pillar of American security?\n\nKORNELIUS: Well, I think she has to make a choice whether she wants to or not. And using Europe as an ally will need give and take, will need listening to European concerns. But also, will definitely need to put more pressure on Europe to stand up to its commitments. I guess there's a huge preparedness in Europe to do this. Times have never been so good for increasing European security. And since America's demand is also now stretched, the United States is basically on the edges in the Middle East and the China threat is real. The Europeans do know that they have to live up to these commitments.\n\nFIX: I'm actually concerned that if Kamala Harris wins, Europeans will go back to business as usual, and we'll think, \"Oh, now the United States is back to normal. We can stop investing in our own defense. We are in a safe haven again.\" Because even with Kamala Harris, the challenge that the United States is faced with when it comes to China is so big that sooner or later Europeans have to do more for their own security because the United States, regardless of a Democratic or Republican administration, will be so consumed by the China challenge. My concern is that as it was the case after the election of Joe Biden Europeans will be hugely relieved and forget everything that they promised to do when they were scared of Donald Trump.\n\nSIERRA: So, twist, does that mean that Trump actually could be better for NATO than Harris?\n\nFIX: Yeah, if there were not the fear that he would withdraw entirely, I think Trump played a role together with the threat from Vladimir Putin's side in incentivizing Europeans to spend more. I think it's really difficult to say its otherwise. So, I don't think Europeans will necessarily spend less under Kamala Harris, but they might be less motivated to increase what they're spending now. So, for example, to move towards 2.5 or 3 percent. Whereas if Donald Trump comes and says, \"Well, either you spend 2.5 percent or 3 percent or I will leave NATO,\" which Kamala Harris would never do, that incentive is of course bigger. So, it's a brutal way of blackmailing that might perhaps in fact be more successful on defense spending to be honest.\n\nSIERRA: Yikes, a dangerous game.\n\nFIX: Yeah. Absolutely.\n\nIn 2023, the German Marshall Fund found that Europeans expressed little faith in America's future influence. While 64 percent described the United States as the world's most influential actor today, only 37 percent believed that this will be the case in five years.\n\nSIERRA: What concerns do Europeans have about the future role of the United States?\n\nKORNELIUS: The background of a growing isolationism in the United States is basically driven by the Republicans and the Trump movement. And this causes fear. It tells us, well, the country's no longer interested in the world, or it is interested, but to such terms which we cannot agree upon and where I do think they will not work anyway. That will increase America's isolationism. Now the United States, it's such a huge mass of country, such a huge number of people, and such an economic might, that isolationism probably isn't that badly felt within the country. You can easily isolate yourself without even noticing. But it is felt across the borders, by those countries who economically and security-wise do depend on the United States to some extent. And this is why fear was growing that this isolationism leads to a growing disconnect between us, even under Democratic leadership. And the Democrats were bowing to these isolationist tendencies, which was also fueled by fear of migration. We have the same phenomenon in Europe. People do fear that there's too much migration and they want to build borders. They want to push back people. And this isolationist tendency has led to an increased suspicion of how America will handle its future. America has plenty, and this kind of greatness, this kind of plentiness, comes also from the fact that this is a global country. That this is a country which basically feeds off the world. And if you give up the world, you give up a part of your identity, and you will collapse domestically. This is sort of a domino effect, which probably will not be felt immediately. But over time, it will.\n\nIn November, the choices we make here will shape the lives of millions who will never cast a vote in an American election, just as they have for decades. And that\u2019s a reminder of the power our vote holds, not just at home, but everywhere.\n\nSIERRA: How do Europeans feel about the fact that the U.S. election has this much influence, or potential influence, in Europe?\n\nKORNELIUS: I think they take it much more as a given than they would feel angry about it. America always gave a sense of security. You can rely on it. This is a like-minded country. This is a country which has European roots, which brought its democratic culture from the European revolution and its own revolution, and built that up as a role model for the world. We lived through an American century. We lived through a century where all institutions after World War II were set up on the American idea of sharing power, of global governance, the UN system, the World Bank system, all of this. We all agree that this all needs renovation. This all needs, kind of, remodeling because the world has changed, and the kind of power we have amassed in the Northern Hemisphere, and mostly the Western countries as we call them, needs to be shared, needs to be rethought. Now all of a sudden, the idea of the Western world is being questioned by Donald Trump. And this makes people feel uneasy and this is why these elections have such a dramatic, historic impact not only for America, but also for the rest of the world.\n\nAs is tradition, our amazing interns from this summer will read us out today.

        "text": "How the assassination attempt on Donald Trump is affecting US election bets and polls\nIn any other race, an assassination attempt on a candidate would have been the most dramatic and potentially game-changing event.\n\nThis race has now seen two on Donald Trump. And that follows already extraordinary affairs like the last-minute replacement of a sitting president as candidate.\n\nBut look at our recently launched poll tracker, and it looks as placid as an undisturbed puddle - US vice president Kamala Harris ahead, with minor fluctuations.\n\nAnd that's including some of the recent polls following the Trump-Harris debate.\n\nWhy so steady? Because it's an average of very many polls, because the polls themselves are slow to react to events, and also because so much of the electorate has already decided who they're voting for.\n\nBut if you want to get a sense of a real race, wheel-to-wheel, with candidates edging ahead and then falling behind one another, look at the betting data.\n\nYou can see events causing big shifts almost in real time, including the most recent apparent assassination attempt, which appears to show a small drop in the odds.\n\nCompare that with the rise he saw after the assassination attempt on 13 July.\n\nOr look at US President Joe Biden's odds falling away immediately after his debate with Mr Trump.\n\nAnd last week's Trump-Harris debate seems to have boosted Ms Harris's odds.\n\nThere are caveats to this - betting on presidential elections is banned in the US, so this is all from international bets.\n\nBut it's still a lot of money, with some \u00a366m having been bet so far, according to Betfair - and people are putting all that money where their mouths are.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:46 Trump v Harris debate: What happened\n\nRead more from Sky News:\n\n'I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!' Trump lashes out after star backs Harris\n\nWhere did Donald Trump's pet-eating claims come from?\n\nThe main takeaway is just how tight this is. That might seem odd when you look back again at the headline polling, showing a consistent Harris lead.\n\nBut because of the US system, and the electoral college, in which states award votes, Ms Harris needs to be significantly further ahead.\n\nFollow Sky News on WhatsApp Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky News Tap here\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free\n\nAnd the reason the race is so tight - the reason the betting markets show it moving so much, even if the polling doesn't - is we can't say whether Ms Harris's lead will be enough.\n\nRight now it's better than Hilary Clinton's in 2016 - where she won the popular vote and still lost the electoral college - but not as big as Mr Biden's in 2020.\n\nPollsters have different thoughts about how big her lead needs to be to translate to electoral college success.\n\nBut even then, in a swing state like Pennsylvania, one which is pivotal in this race, it could come down to a tiny fraction of the electorate.\n\nSpreaker Spreaker , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

        "text": "Panel event will discuss global implications of the U.S. presidential election\nUNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. \u2014 The Penn State School of International Affairs (SIA) is hosting a panel event to explore how the upcoming U.S. presidential election will impact politics and policies around the world. The event, Global Implications of the U.S. Presidential Election, will take place 4-5:15 p.m. on Wednesday, October 9, in the Sutliff Auditorium of the Lewis Katz Building.\n\nThe event will include panelist remarks and questions from the audience. Registration is required to attend.\n\nThe expert panel features four SIA professors who will examine the presidential election through various international affairs lenses, including foreign policy, economics, trade, and the global media.\n\nDr. Mitchell Smith, director of SIA and professor of international affairs, will deliver opening remarks and serve as moderator for the event.\n\n\u201cAlong with the massive domestic political stakes of which we are well aware, the upcoming U.S. presidential election will have crucial international implications that may be less evident,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThe faculty in the School of International Affairs have the expertise to illuminate these implications. I look forward to the opportunity for SIA to share our insights with the Penn State campus and the surrounding community.

        "text": "TikTok in the 2024 US Presidential Race: Trending Campaign Strategy or Passing Trend?\nThe US presidential race has officially entered its \u201cTikTok era\u201d. Gone are the days of relying squarely on traditional campaign ads broadcast between news segments. Instead, with a third of American adults under 30 getting their news on the platform, top contenders have taken directly to their voters\u2019 TikTok feeds to boost campaign visibility and take reputational jabs against opponents. Candidates and their teams churn out content that is often heavily coded in memes, pop culture references, and \u201cnetspeak\u201d. Given TikTok\u2019s reported 1 billion monthly active users worldwide, the app\u2019s advent as an arena for political content in democracies was inevitable. Yet this spike in campaign activity stands in stark contrast to the growing recognition in Washington\u2014including among presidential candidates themselves\u2014that TikTok poses a national security threat due to its People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC)-based ownership.\n\nTikTok has already been banned on US government devices for data security reasons, and the American intelligence community has pointed to PRC attempts to influence elections through the platform. In April 2024, US President Joe Biden signed legislation that requires TikTok to divest from its parent company, ByteDance, by January 19, 2025, or face removal from the Google Play and Apple app stores\u2014a de facto ban. TikTok and ByteDance filed suit in May to block the law, and the Department of Justice has since defended it by noting that \u201cthe serious national-security threat posed by TikTok is real.\u201d An appeals court heard oral arguments on September 16, with the potential for an expedited ruling in December before the law takes effect.\n\nNeither the uncertainty over TikTok\u2019s future in the United States nor concerns that the PRC could put a thumb on the scale of US political debates through its algorithm have stopped presidential candidates from heading to the platform. In fact, the backdrop of precariousness has coincided with an uptick in energized campaign activity on the app. Candidates have deployed unconventional toolkits comprising memes, influencers, trending sounds, and pop culture branding to amass millions of followers and gain credibility among GenZ voters. While reposting content and maintaining a long-term online presence, as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has done, may be an avenue for slow and steady growth, posts from Kamala Harris and Donald Trump that have driven a rapidly expanding following play directly into internet culture by capitalizing on the slang and humor of the youngest American voters. In 2024, the first\u2014and maybe the only\u2014chapter of presidential politics on TikTok, even the app\u2019s critics may be the same faces that pop up the most on your feed.\n\nHere is how the US presidential and vice presidential candidates are using TikTok:\n\nKamala Harris\n\nKamala Harris now has two TikTok accounts: her campaign inherited one from the Biden campaign (@kamalahq), and she launched another, personal account (@kamalaharris) on July 25.\n\nJoe Biden/Kamala Harris Campaign\n\nJoined TikTok: February 2024 (\u201cbidenhq\u201d) and July 2024 (account rebranded to \u201ckamalahq\u201d)\n\nFollower count: 427,000 (for Biden when he dropped out of the race, compared to about 38 million on X and 17 million on Instagram at that same time); 4.4 million as of September, almost two months after the account transferred to Harris (compared to 21 million on X and 18.4 million on Instagram)\n\nLikes: 134.2 million\n\nStyle: brat-coded and meme-driven\n\nTypes of posts: The Harris campaign account has received significant attention online, in part by capitalizing on a shoutout on X from popstar Charli XCX, who declared that \u201ckamala IS brat\u201d (playing off themes of Charli\u2019s newly released album, \u201cbrat\u201d, which contains songs that promote being carefree, bold, and unapologetic). In general, Harris\u2019 content relies on trending sounds and pop culture references. The Biden campaign\u2019s posts similarly focused on viral sounds and memes, in large part to take reputational jabs at Trump.\n\nNotable Examples:\n\nHarris\u2019 second post featured a slideshow of side-by-side images of Trump and her set to the track of \u201cFemininomenon\u201d by breakout pop singer Chappell Roan. https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZP8dur8Le/\n\nHarris\u2019 posts are riddled with comments celebrating \u201cProject Coconut\u201d, a term that combines allusions to a viral sound bite of Harris referencing coconut trees in a speech with the Heritage Foundation\u2019s \u201cProject 2025\u201d plan.\n\nOne of Biden\u2019s most popular posts, which garnered 1.2 million views, featured a still image of Trump containing the text \u201cDance or don\u2019t commit 34 felonies\u201d overlayed with a video, likely generated by artificial intelligence (AI), of Trump performing a viral TikTok dance to the song \u201cBop\u201d by Big Boogie and DJ Drama. https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZP8duDCka/\n\nKey themes: The campaign account frequently features clips of younger campaign staff taking jabs at Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, by stitching together videos and audio from their media appearances and interviews. The account also increasingly promotes Harris campaign videos and \u201cfan edits\u201d (stitched videos of Harris set to empowering music).\n\nKamala Harris (personal):\n\nJoined TikTok: July 25, 2024\n\nFollower count: 5.5 million (1.6 million within its first 16 hours)\n\nLikes: 46.6 million\n\nStyle: empowered and music-driven\n\nTypes of posts: Harris\u2019 personal account features professionally filmed content depicting the vice president making public appearances at political rallies, occasionally with celebrities, and debuting her running mate, Tim Walz.\n\nNotable Examples:\n\nHarris posted footage from a rally in Detroit, set to Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s hit song, \u201cFreedom\u201d. The camera pans from Harris walking off the plane to a vast crowd of supporters. https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZP8dufpmW/\n\nOne of Harris\u2019 most popular post to date, which has garnered 34.3 million views, features a clip from a political rally and is set to Kendrick Lamar\u2019s \u201cNot Like Us\u201d, in which Harris challenges Trump to a debate and declares \u201cIf you\u2019ve got something to say, say it to my face.\u201d https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZP8dudKXo/\n\nKey themes: Harris\u2019 personal posts often feature content that uses scenic shots and empowering music to create impressions of power and momentum. While the account plays with TikTok-centric themes, including by using trending sounds and selfie-style celebrity endorsements (including from America Ferrera and Megan Thee Stallion), Harris\u2019 personal account does not rely on memes that \u201ckamalahq\u201d does.\n\nPosition on TikTok\u2019s future: In keeping with the position of the Biden administration, the Harris campaign has said to Axios that \u201cWe don\u2019t want to ban TikTok. \u2026 We would just like to see a change in ownership.\u201d Harris herself has cited \u201cvery important\u201d benefits to the platform and national security concerns linked to its ownership.\n\nDonald Trump\n\nLike Harris, Trump has created two TikTok accounts: his personal account (@realdonaldtrump), and a campaign account (@teamtrump).\n\nDonald Trump (personal)\n\nJoined TikTok: early June 2024\n\nFollower count: 11.2 million as of September (compared to 90.8 million on X and 26.6 million on Instagram)\n\nLikes: 49.6 million\n\nStyle: dramatic, influencer-focused, and sloganized\n\nTypes of posts: Trump\u2019s posts often feature shorter sound bites and slogans from speeches and public engagements overlayed with videos of his appearances and interaction with voters at events and campaign rallies. Trump\u2019s posts have also heavily featured influencers Logan and Jake Paul, whose TikTok followings stand at 18.7 and 18 million, respectively.\n\nNotable Examples:",

May 17, 2024 | News Article The Christian Science Monitor | National Since his rise to the heights of politics nine years ago, former U.S. President Donald Trump has continuously denounced mail-in voting as a concrete example of what he claims is endemic fraud in American elections.

With this technology now more available and powerful than ever, its malicious use is poised to test the security of the United States\u2019 electoral process by giving nefarious actors intent on undermining American democracy\u2014including China, Iran, and Russia\u2014the ability to supercharge their tactics.

Although the technology won\u2019t introduce fundamentally new risks in the 2024 election\u2014bad actors have used cyberthreats and disinformation for years to try to undermine the American electoral process\u2014it will intensify existing risks.

In large part, responsibility for meeting this threat will fall to the country\u2019s state and local election officials.

        "text": "First in-person votes cast in US presidential election\nFirst in-person votes cast in US presidential election\n\n'Early is better' - Voters in Virginia cast first in-person ballots\n\nThe first in-person votes have been cast in the US presidential race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, a milestone moment that comes six weeks before election day on 5 November. Virginia became the first state in the country to allow in-person voting on Friday, and early polling sites will remain open there until 2 November. Some long queues were seen as voters cast ballots on national, state and local levels. The situation in two other states, Minnesota and South Dakota, is different as voters there can only hand in absentee ballots in person instead of mailing them. \u201cWhy not try to be first? That\u2019s kind of fun, right?\u201d one voter in Minnesota, Jason Miller, told the Associated Press.\n\nGetty Images\n\nSome 69% of votes cast during the 2020 election were done through early in-person voting or through mail-in ballots, according to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's election data science lab found. Some in a queue in Fairfax, Virginia, told the BBC they felt it was their civic duty to vote early. \u201cYou never know if you\u2019ll be hit by a bus,\" one voter said on Friday, adding that they wanted to be \u201csafe not sorry\". Another said the good weather - and a day working from home - had prompted them to cast their early ballot. Virginia has been a reliably Democratic state in the last few elections, but some Republicans have been bullish about trying to flip it in November. Voters there will also be casting votes for the state\u2019s eleven members of congress and one of its two senators. Early and mail-in voting has been a hot-button issue since the 2020 election, with just 37% of Republicans saying people should have the option to vote early, according to polling from the Pew Research Center. That sharply contrasts with 82% support from Democrats.\n\nMore on US election",

Tim Walz.\n\nThe first ballots being cast in person come with just over six weeks left before Election Day on Nov. 5. About a dozen more states will follow with early in-person voting by mid-October.\n\n\u201cIf I could wave a magic wand in this room right now, I would wish for two things: Between now and November 5th, I want to see high turnout and low drama,\u201d Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon said during a news conference Thursday that previewed his state\u2019s efforts around the election season. Simon also serves as president of the National Association of Secretaries of State.\n\nAcross the country, local election directors are beefing up their security to keep their workers and polling places safe while also ensuring that ballots and voting procedures won\u2019t be tampered with. Officials and ordinary poll workers have been targets of harassment and even death threats since the 2020 presidential election.\n\nFederal authorities are investigating the origin of suspicious packages that have been sent to or received by elections officials in more than 15 states in recent days, including Virginia.\n\nAs the start of early voting approached, Trump\u2019s rhetoric turned more ominous with a pledge to prosecute anyone who \u201ccheats\u201d in the election in the same way he falsely claimed they did in 2020, when he lied about widespread fraud and attacked officials who stood by their accurate vote tallies.\n\nTrump has previously sought to sow doubts about mail voting and encouraged voters to cast ballots in person on Election Day. But this year, Trump and the Republican National Committee, which he now controls, have begun to embrace early and mail voting as a way to lock in GOP votes before Election Day, just as Democrats have done for years.",

        "text": "Teamsters decide not to make 2024 presidential endorsement\nThe International Brotherhood of Teamsters declined to endorse in the 2024 presidential race, becoming the only one of the nation's major 10 unions not to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nIn a statement, the union said it had \"few commitments on top Teamsters issues from either former President Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris\u2014and found no definitive support among members for either party's nominee.\"\n\nThe Teamsters is one of the largest unions in the U.S., with 1.3 million members, including large numbers of transportation and public works employees.\n\nAfter the Teamsters general executive board announced it would not endorse, several joint councils representing most active and retired Teamsters in the battleground states of Nevada, Michigan and Wisconsin, as well as Minnesota and other states, came out in support of Harris.\n\n\"As Vice President of the most pro-union administration ever, Kamala Harris worked with the Teamsters and other union workers to pass the historic Butch Lewis Act which has saved the pensions of over a million retirees to date,\" said Bill Carroll, President of Teamsters Joint Council 39, in Wisconsin. \"This November we will work with millions of union workers across the country to defeat Donald Trump once again.\"\n\nAlthough the national Teamsters union has endorsed Democrats since 1996, when it did not endorse a candidate, Teamsters president Sean O'Brien spoke at the Republican National Convention in July. The last time the Teamsters endorsed the GOP candidate in a presidential election was in 1988 for then-candidate George H.W. Bush. They also endorsed Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984 and Richard Nixon in 1972.\n\nIn the announcement of its decision Wednesday, the labor union cited a lack of commitment from both Trump and Harris to \"not to interfere in critical union campaigns or core Teamsters industries\u2014and to honor our members' right to strike.\" The union said neither candidate pledged to avoid government intervention in railroad or airline strikes. In 2022, Mr. Biden signed legislation that imposed a labor agreement on rail workers to avert a strike during the holidays.\n\nTeamsters Union members picket at the Marathon Petroleum Detroit refinery on September 4, 2024 in Detroit, Michigan. Bill Pugliano / Getty Images\n\nThe Teamsters noted that Harris did pledge to sign the PRO Act, which would strengthen the right to unionize, and Trump would not commit to vetoing \"right to work\" legislation in a second term.\n\nO'Brien forced the union's first-ever roundtable interview process for the 2024 endorsement at the end of last year, inviting all major-party candidates to make their case for the union's support. Union leadership met with former President Donald Trump, as well President Biden earlier this year. In July, Harris replaced Mr. Biden as the Democratic nominee and met with the Teamsters on Monday.\n\nO'Brien said the Monday meeting with Harris focused on the same questions as the previous roundtables with Trump and Mr. Biden. O'Brien said the rank-and-file members advocated for the passage of the PRO Act and the veto of any \"Right to Work\" laws. He added that Harris acknowledged the diversity of political opinion among the Teamsters, while also criticizing her Republican opponent during the conversation.\n\n\"The roundtable went really well,\" O'Brien said. \"One thing that's important, we have the same roundtable that we've had for all the presidential candidates that have come in. We've asked the same question to each candidate, mostly Teamsters specific issues. We also ask questions regarding legislation such as the PRO Act, bankruptcy reform and antitrust.\"\n\nO'Brien said earlier this month on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" he hadn't endorsed in the 2024 presidential race yet because he had yet to meet Harris, and \"you don't hire someone unless you give them an interview.\"\n\nThe Teamsters executive board met on Wednesday following its meeting with Harris to discuss the endorsement decision.\n\nThe union conducted polling before Mr. Biden exited the presidential race, and found a plurality of its members backed him over Trump, 44% to 36%. But in a subsequent poll of Harris and Trump, the former president won far more support, 60% to 34%, and in a second poll that concluded on Sept. 15, members again chose Trump by a large margin, 58% to 31%.\n\nIn a statement, the Trump campaign touted the poll numbers showing support, saying that \"while the Executive Board of the Teamsters is making no formal endorsement, the vast majority of rank-and-file working men and women in this important organization want President Donald Trump back in the White House.\"\n\nIn response to the Teamsters' decision, Harris spokesperson Lauren Hitt touted Harris' ties to organized labor, pointing out that she walked with a United Auto Workers picket line in 2019. Hitt also noted Trump's recent comments during an interview with Elon Musk suggesting that striking workers should be fired. The United Auto Workers filed federal labor charges against Musk and Trump, accusing them of trying to \"intimidate and threaten\" workers.\n\n\"As the Vice President told the Teamsters on Monday, when she is elected president, she will look out for the Teamsters rank-and-file no matter what,\" Hitt added.\n\n\"I work with a lot of Republicans\u2026 and I'm getting a lot of positive push for Trump,\" said Brett Ohnstad, a Teamsters member and corrections officer in Minnesota. \"However, we're not looking at who's going to be the candidate that fills the whole gamut. We're looking here at just who is going to support labor.\"\n\n\"Our members are the union, and their voices and opinions must be at the forefront of everything the Teamsters do,\" O'Brien said. \"Our final decision around a possible Presidential endorsement will not be made lightly, but you can be sure it will be driven directly by our diverse membership.\"\n\nSome factions within the Teamsters, such as the Teamsters' National Black Caucus, broke with O'Brien earlier this year and endorsed Harris.\n\nJames Curbeam, the head of the Teamsters National Black Caucus, said he was not surprised by the board's decision but expressed skepticism about how reflective the polling is of the rank-and-file, claiming only a fraction of the total Teamsters membership participated in the online polling. CBS News has reached out to the Teamsters for further details on the polling.\n\n\"It's a disappointment that our overall international [board] didn't do it, but locals and joint councils know the right thing to do,\" Curbeam added.\n\nThe decision could influence certain battleground states in the Nov. 5 election where union membership is strong, including Michigan, Nevada and Pennsylvania.\n\nO'Brien made waves at this year's Republican National Convention after delivering one of the most anti-big business speeches in recent RNC memory and becoming the first boss in the organization's 121-year history to address the convention. He was not invited to speak at the Democratic National Committee.\n\n\"Today, the Teamsters are here to say we are not beholden to anyone or any party,\" O'Brien said during the July speech. \"We will create an agenda and work with a bipartisan coalition, ready to accomplish something real for the American worker. And I don't care about getting criticized.\"",

        "text": "Early voting for 2024 presidential election starts today in Minnesota. Here's what you need to know.\nST. PAUL, Minn. \u2014 While we are just about a month and a half away from the presidential election, Minnesotans can start casting ballots as soon as Friday.\n\nWith Election Day fast approaching, election officials say now is the time to make plans to vote.\n\nYou can vote in person on Election Day at your designated polling place, and you can vote early, either in person or by mail.\n\n\n\nIf you decide to mail in your ballot, it has a tracking code to ensure ballots reach their destination.\n\nAn important note: mail ballots need to be received by 8 p.m. on Election Day to be counted.\n\nThis year in particular, Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon is really stressing that absentee ballots should be mailed sooner rather than later, due to nationwide delays with the postal service.\n\nSimon suggests mailing absentee ballots at least a week before Election Day. Despite the mail delays, he's somewhat optimistic things will go smoothly.\n\n\"If we could handle, and the USPS could handle 2020, with that massive volume of mail and voting by mail, then surely they can handle the challenges this year,\" said Simon.\n\nElection officials say the integrity of the election will be preserved, thanks to the following, long-standing security measures:\n\nAll ballots are on paper and have to be preserved for two years.\n\nAll local elections offices conduct public accuracy tests to ensure election equipment is working.\n\nOn election night, every precinct must ensure the same number of ballots were cast as registered voters.\n\nAfter the election, all precincts conduct an audit, to ensure elections worked with perfect accuracy.\n\n\"All these steps make sure that our elections are free, fair, secure and accurate,\" said Simon.\n\nFor info on everything you need to vote, you can head here.\n\nVoters cast their ballots early\n\n\"I just wanted to get it done as soon as possible,\" said Sam Goetz, early voter.\n\nAbout an hour after early voting opened, Minneapolis residents took time out of their day to cast their ballot.\n\n\"I know who I want to vote for. I don't need to see any more debates,\" said Rebecca Louk, Minneapolis.\n\n\"I always vote. I travel a lot and I love the early voting,\" said Wanda Adefris, Minneapolis.\n\nThe election center on Hennepin Avenue in Minneapolis was steady Friday morning, but far from the high early turnout election directors saw in 2020.\n\n\"For 2020, during the national pandemic, we saw a lot of people choosing to vote by mail or vote early to avoid the polls on Election Day,\" said Katie Smith, director of elections and voter services in Minneapolis.\n\nBut Minneapolis residents who did decide to vote in mid-September had hot button-issues on their minds.\n\n\"The right to choose,\" said Chris from Minneapolis.\n\n\"The big one for me is reproductive rights are important. I wanted to make sure that got protected. The climate is another really big one for me,\" said Goetz.\n\nIn Anoka County it was much the same. People had their reasons for showing up early to cast their ballot.\n\n\"Just seemed like something new to do,\" said Nina English.\n\nEnglish and Scott Groethe drove from Blaine to the Anoka County Government Center hoping to make a difference in this year's election.\n\n\"My wife is from Asia, she's a U.S. citizen now. She did it the tried and true way, she stood in line. Immigration and inflation. There's are my big two,\" said Groethe.",

        "text": "US: Muslim groups urge voters to back Jill Stein, Cornel West or other pro-Palestine candidates\nA coalition of Muslim-American groups angry at US support for Israel's devastating war on Gaza is asking Muslim voters to shun Democratic Party candidate Kamala Harris in November's presidential race and back either Jill Stein, Cornel West or other pro-Palestine candidates.\n\n\"After extensive consultation, discussion, and deliberation, the American Muslim 2024 Election Task Force has decided to encourage American Muslims to vote for any presidential candidate of their choosing who supports a permanent ceasefire in Gaza and a US arms embargo on the Israeli government, such as candidates Dr Jill Stein, Dr Cornel West or Chase Oliver,\" read the statement, obtained by Middle East Eye.\n\nThe statement was written by the American Muslim 2024 Election Task Force, an umbrella group formed this year that consists of a number of prominent Muslim organisations including the political arms of Americans for Justice in Palestine (AJP), Cair, and the US Council of Muslim Organizations.\n\nIn addition to calling on Muslim Americans to vote for a pro-Palestine candidate at the presidential level, the task force's statement emphasises the need to vote for down-ballot candidates who are also advocating for a ceasefire in Gaza and arms embargo on Israel.\n\nThe statement falls short of endorsing a specific candidate in the presidential election and comes after long deliberations between the leaders of these prominent Muslim organisations.\n\nNew MEE newsletter: Jerusalem Dispatch Sign up to get the latest insights and analysis on Israel-Palestine, alongside Turkey Unpacked and other MEE newsletters\n\nBut the decision to officially call on members of the faith community to vote against either the Democratic or Republican Party marks a major and historic shift in Muslim American voting patterns.\n\nIt also shows a possible turning point for Muslim Americans and their large-scale support for the Democratic Party, with US President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 fervent support for Israel\u2019s war on Gaza as the main factor behind this shift.\n\nActivists launch 'Abandon Kamala Harris' campaign over Gaza policy Read More \u00bb\n\n\"We cannot endorse Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 candidacy because of her refusal to even consider imposing the arms embargo on the Israeli government required by US laws and her failure to promise any other changes whatsoever to President Biden's failed policy of steadfast financial, diplomatic and military support for Israel's genocide in Gaza,\" the statement read.\n\nWhile Muslim-Americans only make up one percent of the US population, the 2.5 million strong voter bloc has sizeable populations in key swing states like Michigan, Georgia, and Pennsylvania.\n\nMuslim-American leaders are hoping that their get-out-the-vote call will show the country, and its two main political parties, that the community will not remain silent over the US's unrelenting bipartisan support for Israel's war efforts against the Palestinian people.\n\n\"The American Muslim community has experienced rapid political growth and maturity in recent years,\" the statement said.\n\n\"We hope and pray that the 2024 presidential election, regardless of the outcome, is a turning point towards a stronger American Muslim community and a better country for all Americans and people around the world impacted by American policy, including in Gaza.\"\n\nJill Stein and the Muslim vote\n\nThe task force\u2019s statement came as a result of intense debate amongst different segments of the faith community.\n\nA source told Middle East Eye that originally the task force had planned to officially endorsement Stein. However, in the 11th hour, a majority of the organisations backed out of the decision.\n\nStein herself is unlikely to win the presidential election come November, according to many polls that have her taking only one percent of the total vote. However, with former President Donald Trump and Harris currently battling over a slim margin of victory, a sizeable vote for Stein could sway the election.\n\nJill Stein on America's democracy crisis, movement building and ending Israel's war on Palestinians Read More \u00bb\n\nStein's opposition to Israel's ongoing war on Gaza - she has referred to the war as a genocide against Palestinians perpetrated by Israel and said she would end the war in her first day of office - and the fact that she has the most ballot access of any third party candidate made her a viable choice for a possible endorsement.\n\nStein is also tied with Vice President Kamala Harris amongst Muslim voters, according to a poll conducted by Cair.\n\nAnother Cair poll found Stein leading among all presidential candidates amongt Muslim voters in a number of swing states - Michigan, Arizona and Wisconsin.\n\nHowever, one long-standing issue that many Muslims had with Stein's current and previous runs for president was her perceived stance regarding the Syrian civil war and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nIn 2011, civil war broke out in Syria following a wave of anti-government protests - and the repression of these protests by the Assad government - in the wake of the larger Arab Spring revolution that swept the Middle East.\n\nThe war has killed more than 507,000 Syrians since it began, while an additional 12 million Syrians have been displaced, resulting in what the UN says is one of the largest displacement crises in the world.\n\nIn 2016, Stein's campaign issued a statement calling on the US to allow the Assad government to regain control of the country.\n\n\u201cStein said the US should be working with Syria, Russia, and Iran to restore all of Syria to control by the government rather than Jihadi rebels,\u201d the statement read, according to a 2016 report by The Hill.\n\nThe statement was later deleted by the campaign, with Stein calling it an error.\n\nStein told MEE that she denies having ever supported Assad.\n\n\u201cWe have never taken a position in support of Bashar al-Assad. We are against intervention because intervention has all sorts of unintended consequences, which are very long-lasting and tend to make things worse,\u201d she said in a video interview.\n\n\"[Assad is] a dictator with a long record of human rights abuses. And we very strongly support the sovereignty, the autonomy and the human rights of the Syrian people and their right to determine their future.\"\n\nStein's 2024 campaign released a statement on 12 September offering a clarification and apology about the previous statement on Syria that was deleted.\n\n\"I want to apologise for this error and state unequivocally that I fully support the Syrian people's right to self-determination in their pursuit of dignity, integrity, and liberty,\" Stein said in the statement.\n\nIn another statement released by her campaign on Thursday, Stein called Assad a \u201cwar criminal\u201d.\n\nShifting away from the Democrats\n\nThe political differences between segments of the broader Muslim-American community are representative of a growing shift in the community's approach to electoral politics.\n\nIn the decades following the post-9/11 \"war on terror\", which was led by the Republican administration of George W Bush, the majority of Muslims in the US began casting votes for the Democratic Party.\n\nIn the past several years, Muslims began to shift away from the Democrats, with some voting for Republican Donald Trump despite his openly Islamophobic rhetoric.\n\nMuslim voters evenly split between Jill Stein and Kamala Harris, new poll finds Read More \u00bb\n\nNow, after 11 months of Israel's war on Gaza, and the Democratic administration of Joe Biden fully supporting the Israeli war efforts with weapons and diplomatic cover, large swathes of Muslims are beginning to abandon the Democrats.\n\nA 2020 poll by Cair found that 69 percent of Muslims voted for Joe Biden in the previous presidential election.\n\nAnother survey conducted before Biden dropped out of the election this year found that only 26 percent of respondents planned to vote for the Democratic Party. Meanwhile, 60 percent plan to vote for either a third-party or independent candidate.\n\nThis widespread anger at the Democratic Party has led to movements like the Abandon Harris campaign (formerly Abandon Biden), a movement of Muslim and Arab Americans dedicated to making sure Harris and the Democrats lose this presidential election over their support for Israel's war.\n\nIsraeli forces have so far killed more than 41,000 Palestinians in Gaza, which is the official death toll determined by the Palestinian health ministry and deemed a highly conservative underestimate of the actual number of Palestinian deaths.\n\nStill, some Muslims, and Arab Americans, continue to stick with the Democratic Party, believing it is the only political camp that can provide positive change for the range of Muslim and Arab issues, chief among them in this election cycle being the Israel-Palestine conflict and war on Gaza.\n\nThe Uncommitted Movement released a carefully worded statement on Thursday saying they could not officially endorse Kamala Harris but urged voters against voting for the alternatives.",

        "text": "United States Economic Forecast\nScenarios\n\nBaseline (60%): Real GDP growth came in stronger than expected in the second quarter of 2024, after slowing in the first quarter. The contrasting results were caused by a big drawdown in inventories in the first quarter, followed by their replenishment in the second quarter; on average, GDP grew at a reasonably strong pace of 2.2% through the first half of this year. We expect GDP to continue growing at a similar pace throughout the remainder of this year before slowing in 2025.\n\nOverall, the story for the US economy remains positive. Consumer spending keeps coming in stronger than expected and is forecasted to rise 2.4% in 2024, slightly more than the 2.2% increase recorded last year. Business investment is predicted to rise 4.2% in this year, down only slightly from the 4.5% growth recorded in 2023. The Inflation Reduction Act and the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) and Science Act are predicted to keep driving strong gains in structures and machinery and equipment investments, while firms continue to heavily invest in software and other intellectual property like artificial intelligence. On the trade front, growth in exports is expected to slow to 2.2% in 2024 before picking up again the following year, while imports are forecasted to increase 3.8% this year. Government spending is predicted to rise 2.9% in 2024.\n\nConsumer price index (CPI) inflation finally fell below 3.0% in July and is expected to continue decreasing, hitting 2.7% by the fourth quarter. Job growth is forecasted to continue slowing, and we expect demographic changes to continue driving down the labor force participation rate. The unemployment rate has risen to its highest level since October 2021. With inflation on the decline and the unemployment rate on the rise, the Federal Reserve is on track to begin cutting rates in September. We predict the target rate to fall 100 basis points this year and a further 100 basis points in 2025.\n\nOverall, real GDP is expected to increase 2.7% in 2024 and by 1.5% in 2025. Between 2026 and 2028, real GDP growth is forecasted to hover between 1.7% and 2.1% per year.\n\nPersistent inflation and geopolitical conflicts (20%): While our baseline remains positive, there are always downside risks to any forecast. We see risks centering around two interrelated issues: 1) geopolitical conflicts and 2) trade policy, which could combine to yield persistent inflation.\n\nConflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East are at risky stages, and the possibility of escalation is high. Both conflicts are in regions with major petroleum production, and so one likely outcome of escalation could come in the form of higher oil prices. In this scenario, the price of oil rises and remains about US$10 above baseline throughout 2025.\n\nGeopolitical conflicts are not just fought with weapons; trade policy is increasingly a battleground for competition. The US presidential election is in full swing, and both major party candidates appear poised to pursue some degree of tariffs on foreign imports. Though the precise effects depend on the tariff design and implementation, these policies will likely impact prices faced by American firms and consumers. Therefore, in this scenario, we model tariffs that increase the cost of imported intermediate inputs by 1% and of imported final goods by a further 1%.\n\nAs a result of the tariffs and the oil price shock, CPI inflation persists above 3% until the third quarter of 2025. Although this scenario still has the same September rate cut as in the baseline scenario, the increased inflationary pressures in late 2024 and 2025 mean the Fed is unable to cut rates further until the end of 2025.\n\nIn this scenario, GDP growth is lower compared to the baseline scenario, particularly over the next two years. Growth in 2024 is 2.6%; by the following year, the tariffs are fully implemented and growth in 2025 is just 1.0%. Growth then averages 2.0% per year from 2026 to 2028.\n\nA golden era for labor markets (20%): Over the past few years, firms have been investing heavily in software and technology. Some of these investments\u2014like those in AI\u2014offer the potential to transform certain types of work. Based on an optimistic view of the uptake and usefulness of new technologies, this scenario sees productivity growing by an average of 1.8% per year from 2024 through 2028, compared to 1.5% in the baseline.\n\nIn addition to the productivity dividend, this scenario sees higher population growth, contributing to an overall population that is 1.1 million larger than in the baseline scenario by the end of the forecast. Along with a bigger population, we model a higher labor force participation rate, as workers continue to delay retirement. Together, these dynamics result in a higher supply of labor for the economy. More workers lead to more output and more spending in a virtuous circle that lifts the overall economy.\n\nIn this scenario, GDP will rise faster than the baseline forecast over the entire forecast horizon. From 2024 through 2028, GDP will increase at an average annual rate of 2.5% per year, 0.5 percentage points higher than the baseline forecast. This scenario also results in higher long-term potential for the economy at 2.8%, compared to 2.2% in the baseline. In that sense, this scenario shows what it would take to make recent rates of economic growth sustainable in the long run.",

Registering to vote and requesting your ballot\n\nThe first step is to request your ballot, and if need be, register to vote from abroad. You should do this every election year to ensure you remain on your state\u2019s overseas voter rolls and to ensure your local election office has your up-to-date contact information. It\u2019s important to register as an absentee voter from abroad because the ballots of US citizens voting from abroad have special protections and are different from the standard absentee ballot.\n\nGo to votefromabroad.org to fill out your Federal Post Card Application (FPCA) absentee ballot request \u2014 it takes 5-10 minutes! If you're not registered to vote, the FPCA also serves as a voter registration form. Choose the option to receive ballots by email.\n\nThe second step is to submit the FPCA absentee ballot request form to your local election office in the United States. Most states allow you to submit your FPCA directly from votefromabroad.org without the need to print it out. But some states require that you submit your completed form by email attachment, fax, or postal mail. State deadlines and submission methods can be found here.\n\nIf you have any questions while filling out your request form, go to the Vote from Abroad FAQ section or type your question in the website's chatbox (red circle in the bottom right-hand corner of each screen). Or you can email us at [email protected]\n\nWatch a video on how to use www.votefromabroad.org in English.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Confirming your request has been accepted \u2705\n\nAfter submitting your FPCA absentee ballot request form, call or email your Local Election Official (LEO) to confirm they have received it and will be sending your ballot. Your LEO's contact information is listed in the instructions generated when you fill out your FPCA form at Vote from Abroad. You can also look up their contact info here.\n\nMost states provide a website where you can verify your voter status.

Receiving your ballot \ud83d\udcec\n\nYour overseas absentee ballot is not your standard absentee ballot back home! Thanks to the MOVE Act, all states must send FPCA-requested absentee ballots to overseas voters no later than 45 days before a federal election \u2014 this year that\u2019s September 21, 2024.\n\nAnd, if requested, all states must send overseas voters their ballot by email.\n\nYou don't need to wait for ballots to arrive on September 21. If you're worried your ballot won't arrive in time for you to return it by the deadline, send in a Backup Ballot NOW.

        "text": "1984 United States presidential election\nAmerican election\n\nPresidential elections were held in the United States on November 6, 1984. Incumbent Republican President Ronald Reagan and his running mate, incumbent Vice President George H. W. Bush, were reelected to a second term in a landslide. They defeated the Democratic ticket of former Vice President Walter Mondale and Congresswoman Geraldine Ferraro.\n\nReagan and Bush faced only token opposition in their bid for re-nomination. Mondale faced a competitive field in his bid, defeating Colorado Senator Gary Hart, activist Jesse Jackson, and several other candidates in the 1984 Democratic primaries. He eventually chose New York Representative Geraldine Ferraro as his running mate, the first woman to be on a major party's presidential ticket.\n\nReagan touted a strong economic recovery from the 1970s stagflation and the 1981\u20131982 recession, and the widespread perception that his presidency had overseen a revival of national confidence and prestige.[2] At 73, Reagan was the oldest person to be nominated by a major party for president, a record that stood until 2020. The Reagan campaign produced effective television advertising and deftly neutralized concerns regarding Reagan's age. Mondale criticized Reagan's supply-side economic policies and budget deficits. He also called for a nuclear freeze and ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment.\n\nReagan won re-election in a landslide victory, carrying 525 electoral votes, 49 states, and 58.8% of the popular vote. Mondale won 13 electoral votes: 10 from his home state of Minnesota, which he won by 3,761 votes, a narrow margin of 0.18%, and 3 from the District of Columbia, which has always voted overwhelmingly for the Democratic candidate.[3] Reagan won the second-largest share of the electoral college since 1820 (second only to Franklin Roosevelt in 1936 and the largest for a Republican), and the most raw electoral votes ever received by a candidate. This is the last time any candidate won the popular vote by double digits.[4] As of the 2024 United States presidential election, Reagan is the last Republican to sweep all of New England.\n\nBackground [ edit ]\n\nRonald Reagan entered the presidency with an unemployment rate of 7.3% and it peaked at 10.6% in December 1982. The United States had a negative gross domestic product growth in 1982.\n\nThe Republicans performed poorly in the 1982 elections. Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, and Jimmy Carter lost an average of 12 seats in the United States House of Representatives in their first midterm. The Republicans lost 26 seats in the U.S. House elections. The Republicans lost seven governorships as well.\n\nReagan's approval rating fell to 35% by January 1983. Polling showed him losing to Democratic candidates, including Walter Mondale and John Glenn. However, unemployment fell to 7.7% by March 1984, and Reagan's approval rating was at 54% in January 1984. His approval rating was aided by the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings and the invasion of Grenada. Polling by CBS News and The New York Times in January 1984 showed him leading Mondale by 16%.\n\nNominations [ edit ]\n\nPrimaries [ edit ]\n\nPresident Reagan and Vice President Bush at the 1984 Republican National Convention in Dallas\n\nReagan-Bush '84, under the leadership of Ed Rollins, was organized on October 17, 1983. Reagan delayed his campaign announcement as not running would make him a lame duck whereas running would make everything he did be viewed as part of his campaign. He announced that he would seek reelection on January 29, 1984.\n\nVice President George H. W. Bush and U.S. Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker were considered as possible candidates only if Reagan did not run. Reagan was the first incumbent president since Richard Nixon in 1972 to face no significant opposition for renomination. The popular vote from the Republican primaries was as follows:[14]\n\nRonald Reagan (inc.): 6,484,987 (98.6%)\n\nUnpledged delegates: 41,411 (0.6%)\n\nOthers: 21,643 (0.3%)\n\n\"Ronald Reagan No\": [ a ] 14,047 (0.2%)\n\n14,047 (0.2%) Harold E. Stassen: 12,749 (0.2%)\n\nDavid Kelly: 360\n\nGary Arnold: 252\n\nBenjamin Fernandez: 202\n\nEndorsements [ edit ]\n\nReagan was renominated by a vote of 2,233 delegates (two delegates abstained). For the only time in American history, the vice presidential roll call was taken concurrently with the presidential roll call. Vice President George H. W. Bush was overwhelmingly renominated. This was the last time in the 20th century that the vice-presidential candidate of either major party was nominated by roll call vote.\n\nMondale campaigning in Pennsylvania\n\nPrimaries [ edit ]\n\nMondale celebrates his victory in the Iowa caucus.\n\nOnly three Democratic candidates won any state primaries: Mondale, Hart, and Jackson. Initially, Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy, after a failed bid to win the 1980 Democratic nomination for president, was considered the de facto front-runner of the 1984 primary. However, Kennedy announced in December 1982 that he did not intend to run.[17][18] Former Vice President Mondale was then viewed as the favorite to win the Democratic nomination. Mondale had the largest number of party leaders supporting him, and he had raised more money than any other candidate. However, both Jackson and Hart emerged as surprising, and troublesome, opponents.\n\nSouth Carolina Senator Ernest Hollings's wit and experience, as well as his call for a budget freeze, won him some positive attention, but his relatively conservative record alienated liberal Democrats, and he was never really noticed in a field dominated by Mondale, John Glenn, and Gary Hart. Hollings dropped out two days after losing badly in New Hampshire and endorsed Hart a week later. His disdain for his competitors was at times showcased in his comments. He notably referred to Mondale as a \"lapdog\", and to former astronaut Glenn as \"Sky King\" who was \"confused in his capsule.\"[19]\n\nCalifornia Senator Alan Cranston hoped to galvanize supporters of the nuclear freeze movement that had called on the United States to halt the deployment of existing nuclear weapons and the development of new ones. Glenn and Askew hoped to capture the support of moderate and conservative Democrats. None of them possessed the fundraising ability of Mondale nor the grassroots support of Hart and Jackson, and none won any contests.\n\nJackson was the second African-American (after Shirley Chisholm) to mount a nationwide campaign for the presidency, and he was the first African-American candidate to be a serious contender. He got 3.5 million votes during the primaries, third behind Hart and Mondale. He won the primaries in Virginia, South Carolina, and Louisiana, and split Mississippi, where there were two separate contests for Democratic delegates. Through the primaries, Jackson helped confirm the black electorate's importance to the Democratic Party in the South at the time. During the campaign, however, Jackson made an off-the-cuff reference to Jews as \"Hymies\" and New York City as \"Hymietown\", for which he later apologized. Nonetheless, the remark was widely publicized, and derailed his campaign for the nomination.[20] Jackson ended up winning 21% of the national primary vote but received only 8% of the delegates to the national convention, and he initially charged that his campaign was hurt by the same party rules that allowed Mondale to win. He also poured scorn on Mondale, saying that Hubert Humphrey was the \"last significant politician out of the St. Paul-Minneapolis\" area.[21]\n\nHart, from Colorado, was a more serious threat to Mondale, and after winning several early primaries it looked as if he might take the nomination away from Mondale. Hart finished a surprising second in the Iowa caucuses, with 16.5% of the vote. This established him as the main rival to Mondale, effectively eliminating John Glenn, Ernest Hollings and Alan Cranston as alternatives.[22] Hart criticized Mondale as an \"old-fashioned\" Great Society Democrat who symbolized \"failed policies\" of the past. Hart positioned himself (just as Bill Clinton would eight years later) as a younger, fresher, and more moderate Democrat who could appeal to younger voters. He emerged as a formidable candidate, winning the key New Hampshire, Ohio, and California primaries as well as several others, especially in the West. However, Hart could not overcome Mondale's financial and organizational advantages, especially among labor union leaders in the Midwest and industrial Northeast.\n\nHart was also badly hurt in a televised debate with Mondale during the primaries, when the former vice president used a popular television commercial slogan to ridicule Hart's vague \"New Ideas\" platform. Turning to Hart on camera, Mondale told Hart that whenever he heard Hart talk about his \"New Ideas\", he was reminded of the Wendy's fast-food slogan \"Where's the beef?\" The remark drew loud laughter and applause from the viewing audience and caught Hart off-guard. Hart never fully recovered from Mondale's charge that his \"New Ideas\" were shallow and lacking in specifics.\n\nMondale celebrates several victories in March 13 primaries with Jimmy Carter (under whom Mondale had previously served as vice president) at his campaign headquarters.\n\nAt a roundtable debate between the three remaining Democratic candidates moderated by Phil Donahue, Mondale and Hart got into such a heated argument over the issue of U.S. policy in Central America that Jackson had to tap his water glass on the table to help get them to stop.\n\nMondale gradually pulled away from Hart in the delegate count, but, as Time reported in late May, \"Mondale ... has a wide lead in total delegates (1,564 to 941) ... because of his victories in the big industrial states, his support from the Democratic Establishment and the arcane provisions of delegate-selection rules that his vanguard helped draft two years ago.\"[23] After the final primary in California, on June 5, which Hart won, Mondale was about 40 delegates short of the total he needed for the nomination.[24] However, at the Democratic National Convention in San Francisco on July 16, Mondale received the overwhelming support of the unelected superdelegates from the party establishment to win the nomination.\n\nMondale's nomination marked the second time since the nomination of former governor of Georgia Jimmy Carter in 1976 and the fourth time since the nomination of former Representative John W. Davis in 1924 that the Democratic Party nominated a private citizen for president (not serving in an official government role at the time of the nomination and election). Mondale was the last private citizen to be nominated for president by the Democratic Party until former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2016. He was also the last former vice president to be nominated for president until Joe Biden in 2020.\n\nThis race for the Democratic Party presidential nomination was the closest in two generations, and, as of 2020, it was the last occasion that a major party's race for the presidential nomination went all the way to its convention.\n\nEndorsements [ edit ]\n\nNote: These are only those endorsements that occurred during or before the primary race.\n\nList of Alan Cranston endorsements Cranston had received endorsements from: United States House of Representatives Representative William Lehman of Florida [ 26 ]\n\nConvention [ edit ]\n\nThis was the convention's nomination tally:\n\nWhen he made his acceptance speech at the Democratic Convention, Mondale said: \"Let's tell the truth. Mr. Reagan will raise taxes, and so will I. He won't tell you. I just did.\"[65] Although Mondale intended to expose Reagan as hypocritical and position himself as the honest candidate, the choice of raising taxes as a discussion point likely damaged his electoral chances.\n\nVice presidential nominee [ edit ]\n\nFerraro with Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn and Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis at a campaign stop in Boston\n\nMondale wanted to establish a highly visible precedent with his vice presidential candidate. Mondale chose U.S. Rep. Geraldine A. Ferraro from New York as his running mate, making her the first woman nominated for that position by a major party. Another reason for the nominee to \"go for broke\" instead of balancing the ticket was Reagan's lead in the polls. Mondale hoped to appeal to women, and by 1980, they were the majority of voters. In a \"much criticized parade of possible Veep candidates\" to his home in Minnesota, Mondale considered San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein and Kentucky Governor Martha Layne Collins, also female; Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, an African American; and San Antonio Mayor Henry Cisneros, a Hispanic, as other finalists for the nomination. In addition to her sex, Mondale chose Ferraro because he hoped she would attract ethnic voters with her personal background.[21][66] Unsuccessful nomination candidate Jesse Jackson derided Mondale's vice-presidential screening process as a \"P.R. parade of personalities\", but praised Mondale for his choice, having himself pledged to name a woman to the ticket in the event he was nominated.\n\nMondale had wanted to choose New York Governor Mario Cuomo as his running mate, but Cuomo declined and recommended Ferraro,[67] his prot\u00e9g\u00e9e.[68] Mondale might have named Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis as his running mate had he wanted to make a \"safe\" choice\",[66] while others preferred Senator Lloyd Bentsen because he would appeal to more conservative Southern voters. Nomination rival Gary Hart stated before Ferraro's selection that he would accept an invitation to run with Mondale;[66] Hart's supporters claimed he would do better than Mondale against President Reagan, an argument undercut by a June 1984 Gallup poll that showed both men nine points behind the president.\n\nOther parties [ edit ]\n\nNational Unity Party nomination [ edit ]\n\nFormer U.S. representative John B. Anderson declined to run on April 26, 1984, and endorsed Mondale on August 27.\n\nThe National Unity Party was an outgrowth of John Anderson's presidential campaign from the 1980 presidential election. Anderson hoped that the party would be able to challenge the \"two old parties\", which he viewed as being tied to various special interest groups and incapable of responsible fiscal reform. The intention was to organize the new party in California, Oregon, Washington, Illinois, the New England states, and others where his previous candidacy had proven to have experienced the most success. The party was also eligible for $5.8 million in Federal election funds, but its qualification depended on it being on the ballot in at least ten states; however, it remained unclear if National Unity could actually obtain the funds, or if it needed to be Anderson himself.[69][70][71][72][73][74][75]\n\nAnderson initially was against running, hoping that another notable politico would take the party into the 1984 election, and feared that his own candidacy might result in the party being labeled a \"personality cult\". However, no candidate came forward resulting in Anderson becoming the nominee in waiting. While Anderson had found equal support from the Republicans and Democrats in the 1980 election, the grand majority of the former had since switched back, resulting in the new party being supported principally by those who normally would vote Democratic, which it was feared might make him a spoiler candidate. In light of this, in addition to difficulties in getting on the ballot in his targeted states (Utah and Kentucky were the only two, neither among those he intended to prominently campaign in), Anderson ultimately declined to run.\n\nAnderson announced that he would not run on April 26, 1984.[76] He later endorsed Mondale and a survey of National Unity members showed that they supported his action.[77] Anderson had hoped that the party would continue to grow and field candidates in 1986,[78] and later a presidential candidate in 1988.[76]\n\nLibertarian Party nomination [ edit ]\n\nBurns was the initial frontrunner for the nomination, but withdrew, citing concerns that the party would not be able to properly finance a campaign. The remaining candidates were Bergland; Ravenal, who had worked in the Department of Defense under Robert McNamara and Clark Clifford; and Ruwart. Bergland narrowly won the presidential nomination over Ravenal. His running mate was James A. Lewis. The ticket appeared on 39 state ballots.\n\nCitizens Party nomination [ edit ]\n\nSonia Johnson ran in the 1984 presidential election, as the presidential candidate of the Citizens Party, Pennsylvania's Consumer Party and California's Peace and Freedom Party. Johnson received 72,161 votes (0.1%) finishing fifth. Her running mate for the Citizens Party was Richard Walton and for the Peace and Freedom Party Emma Wong Mar. One of her campaign managers, Mark Dunlea, later wrote a novel about a first female president, Madame President.\n\nCommunist Party nomination [ edit ]\n\nThe Communist Party USA ran Gus Hall for president and Angela Davis for vice president.\n\nGeneral election [ edit ]\n\nCampaign [ edit ]\n\nMondale and Ferraro campaigning in Fort Lauderdale, Florida\n\nMondale unsuccessfully tried to replace Charles Manatt with Bert Lance as chair of the DNC. Mondale made Lance the chair of his presidential campaign. However, Lance had to be removed due to controversy over his tenure as director of the Office of Management and Budget.\n\nReagan's lead in polling declined after the Republican convention due to its strong right-wing stances. Reagan was also criticized for a joke about bombing the Soviet Union. However, polls showed that voters believed Mondale was \"too cautious and vague\" and was trying to appeal to too many special interest groups.\n\nRoger Stone and other strategists working for Reagan viewed Ohio, where unemployment was 10%, as his most vulnerable state.\n\nReagan made appeals to Evangelical voters during the campaign. He declared January 22, 1984, to be National Sanctity of Human Life Day. The American Coalition for Traditional Values (ACTV), under the leadership of Tim LaHaye, was tasked with maintaining Evangelical support. The ACTV planned on registering 2.5 million voters. Laxalt sent a letter to 45,000 ministers in sixteen states, under the title of the Christian Voter Program, asking for them to support Reagan's campaign and register voters.\n\nMondale ran a liberal campaign, supporting a nuclear freeze and the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA). He spoke against what he considered to be unfairness in Reagan's economic policies and the need to reduce federal budget deficits.\n\nWhile Ferraro's choice was popular among Democratic activists, polls immediately after the announcement showed that only 22% of women were pleased about her selection, versus 18% who agreed that it was a bad idea. 60% of all voters thought that pressure from women's groups had led to Mondale's decision, versus 22% who believed that he had chosen the best available candidate.[66] Some members of the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church criticized the Catholic Ferraro for being pro-choice on abortion. Already fighting an uphill battle with voters, Ferraro also faced a slew of allegations, mid-campaign, directed toward her husband, John Zaccaro. These allegations included Zaccaro's possible past involvement in organized crime, pornography distribution, and campaign contribution violations. Ferraro responded to these allegations against her husband by releasing her family tax returns to the media on August 21, 1984. However, the damage to the campaign was already done.[84]\n\nReagan and Bush campaigning in Austin, Texas\n\nAt a campaign stop in Hammonton, New Jersey, Reagan said, \"America's future rests in a thousand dreams inside your hearts. It rests in the message of hope in songs of a man so many young Americans admire, New Jersey's Bruce Springsteen.\" The Reagan campaign briefly used \"Born in the U.S.A.\", a song criticizing the treatment of Vietnam War veterans (which they mistakenly thought was devoid of anti-war content and a very jingoistic patriotic rock song), as a campaign song, without permission, until Springsteen, a lifelong Democrat, insisted that they stop.[86] Two of the more memorable Reagan campaign ads were commonly known as \"Morning in America\" and, after the difficult first debate for the president, \"Bear in the woods\".[87]\n\nClip from the second debate in which Reagan responds to a question about his age\n\nReagan was the oldest president to have served to that time (at 73) and there were questions about his capacity to endure the grueling demands of the presidency, particularly after Reagan had a poor showing in the first 1984 United States presidential debates with Mondale on October 7. He referred to having started going to church \"here in Washington\", although the debate was in Louisville, Kentucky, referred to military uniforms as \"wardrobe\", and admitted to being \"confused\", among other mistakes.[88] In the next debate on October 21, however, in response to a question from journalist Henry Trewhitt[87] about his age, Reagan joked, \"I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience.\" Mondale himself laughed at the joke,[89] and later admitted that Reagan had effectively neutralized the age issue:\n\nIf TV can tell the truth, as you say it can, you'll see that I was smiling. But I think if you come in close, you'll see some tears coming down because I knew he had gotten me there. That was really the end of my campaign that night, I think. [I told my wife] the campaign was over, and it was.[90]\n\nPresidential debates [ edit ]\n\nThere were two presidential debates and one vice presidential debate during the 1984 general election.[91]\n\nResults [ edit ]\n\nResults of the 1984 presidential election by margin, congressional district, and county\n\nThis was the first time since 1960 that the voter turnout percentage rose. Reagan was re-elected in the November 6 election in an electoral and popular vote landslide, winning 49 states by the time the ballots were finished counting on election night at 11:34 PM in Iowa. He won a record 525 electoral votes total (of 538 possible), and received 58.8% of the popular vote; despite Ferraro's selection, 55% of women who voted did so for Reagan,[84] and his 54 to 61% of the Catholic vote was the highest for a Republican candidate in history.[93] Mondale's 13 electoral college votes marked the lowest total of any major presidential candidate since Alf Landon's 1936 loss to Franklin D. Roosevelt, and the fewest of any Democrat since Stephen A. Douglas claimed 12 in the 1860 election, as well as the worst for a Democrat in a two-way race. However, Democrats Alton B. Parker, James M. Cox, John W. Davis, and George S. McGovern, did worse in the popular vote. This was the second-largest share of the electoral college since 1820, and the most raw electoral votes received by a candidate. This is the last time any candidate won the popular vote by double digits.[4]\n\nReagan receiving a concession call from Mondale\n\nWhen Reagan was asked in December 1984 what he wanted for Christmas he joked, \"Well, Minnesota would have been nice\".[94] He lost Minnesota in both this election and in 1980, making it the only state he failed to win in either election.\n\nThe election was the most recent in which the Republican candidate won every state in the Northeastern, Southern, and Pacific regions of the United States, and won at least one county in every state.[95] The 525 electoral votes received by Reagan \u2013 the most received by a nominee in one election \u2013 added to the 489 electoral votes he achieved in 1980, gave him the second highest total electoral votes received by any candidate who was elected to the office of president twice (1,014), and the third highest number of electoral votes received by any candidate who was elected to the office of president behind Richard Nixon's 1,040 and Franklin D. Roosevelt's 1,876 total electoral votes.\n\nStatistical analysis [ edit ]\n\nReagan's landslide victory resulted in him winning 97.6% of electoral votes, behind only Roosevelt's 98.5% in 1936. However, Reagan's popular vote share was below that of the winners in 1920, 1936, 1964, and 1972. His margin of victory was also lower than the winners of 1904, 1920, 1924, 1936, 1964, and 1972. Reagan's percentage in each state rose from 1980, with his best performances occurring in the South and states with large third-party votes. Mondale improved upon Carter's 1980 results in 28 states, but performed worse in 22 states, 15 of which were in the South. Mondale's national percentage of the popular vote was lower by 0.4% compared to Carter.\n\nThe Republicans gained seats in the concurrent U.S. House of Representatives elections and lost two seats in the concurrent U.S. Senate elections, but overall control of both chambers remained the same. Reagan underperformed Republican senatorial candidates in Alaska, Colorado, Kansas, Maine, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, South Carolina, South Dakota, Virginia, and Wyoming. Jesse Helms and Mitch McConnell were the only Republican senatorial candidates that could have benefited from the coattails effect.\n\nPsephologists attributed a factor of the Republican victory to \"Reagan Democrats\", millions of Democrats who voted for Reagan, as in 1980. They characterized such Reagan Democrats as southern whites and northern blue-collar workers who voted for Reagan because they credited him with the economic recovery, saw him as strong on national security issues, and perceived the Democrats as supporting the poor and minorities at the expense of the middle class. The Democratic National Committee commissioned a study after the election that came to these conclusions, but destroyed all copies of the final report, afraid that it would offend the party's key voters.[93]\n\nThe percentage of Democrats who voted for Reagan ranged from 16 to 26% while Republicans voting for Mondale ranged from 3 to 7% according to exit polls by the Los Angeles Times, NBC, ABC/The Washington Post, and CBS News/The New York Times. One-third of people who supported Hart during the Democratic primary voted for Reagan. Polling by CBS News and The New York Times reported that 66% of Anderson voters supported Mondale while 27% supported Reagan and 61% of Carter voters supported Mondale while 25% supported Reagan. 22% of those who did not vote in 1980 supported Reagan while 18% supported Mondale.\n\nReagan also benefited from a near-total collapse in the third-party vote, which dropped to just 0.67% of the popular vote, its lowest level since 1964, with Bergland's campaign alone counting for over a third of this number, and none of the other third-party candidates exceeding 0.1% of the popular vote. Reagan, who won 63% of white evangelical voters in 1980, received 80% of their votes against Mondale.\n\nAs of 2024, this marked the last election where the Republican nominee won Hawaii, Massachusetts, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Washington. It was also the last election where the Republican nominee won Wisconsin until 2016, Iowa until 2004, West Virginia until 2000, the last election in which the winning candidate won by a double-digit margin in the percentage of the popular vote, and the last election where the winning candidate won by an eight-digit margin in total popular votes (10 million or more). This is the last time that the tipping point state (in this case, Michigan) was decided by a double-digit margin.[95]\n\nAt age 73, Reagan was the oldest U.S. president to win a presidential election. Thirty-six years later, in 2020, this record was surpassed by Joe Biden at age 77, and four years later by Donald Trump at age 78.\n\nElectoral results [ edit ]\n\nSource for the popular vote:[104]\n\nSource for the electoral vote:[105]\n\nPopular vote Reagan 58.77% Mondale 40.56% Bergland 0.25% Others 0.42%\n\nElectoral vote Reagan 97.58% Mondale 2.42%\n\nResults by state [ edit ]\n\nSources:[106][107]\n\nLegend States/districts won by Reagan/Bush States/districts won by Mondale/Ferraro \u2020 At-large results (Maine used the Congressional District Method)\n\nMaine allowed its electoral votes to be split between candidates.

Walz expressed his frustration with the election result, particularly the fact that many citizens had chosen Trump over the Democratic ticket. Despite the loss, Walz called for continued effort and unity within the Democratic Party, urging them to fight for their values while also seeking areas of common ground with their opponents. Trump's victory came after a tumultuous campaign marked by two assassination attempts on his life. Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, entered the race only after President Joe Biden's unexpected withdrawal from the contest. Trump\u2019s election marked a dramatic political shift, with the outcome leaving Democrats to reassess their strategy moving forward and focus on protecting state-level governance from harmful policies.\n\nAdvertisement Remove Ad\n\nHarris Struggled to Capitalize on Abortion as Key Issue in U.S. Election 2024 | N18G Kamala Harris' campaign for the White House focused on mobilizing voters upset over the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in 2022, which ended the federal right to abortion. Despite Harris' efforts, exit polls showed that abortion was not a top priority for most voters, with only 14% citing it as their primary issue, compared to nearly a third who said the economy was their main concern. Harris did better than Trump with women voters (53% to 45%), but her share of the female vote was smaller than Biden's in 2020, and Trump made gains among women, improving by 3 percentage points. While Harris campaigned for a federal law to restore abortion rights, Trump argued the issue should be left to states. As abortion laws become more state-specific, future state-level elections, particularly for state supreme courts, will be crucial in determining abortion access.\n\nTrump Rules Out Nikki Haley and Mike Pompeo for New Administration Roles | N18G President-elect Donald Trump announced on November 9 that former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley and ex-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will not join his upcoming administration, despite his appreciation for their past service.

Haley, a former South Carolina governor, endorsed Trump for president after initially criticising him in the primaries.

During his campaign, Trump vowed to bring jobs back to America with tariffs up to 20% on imports, pushing Brussels to prepare a strong response. Von der Leyen, speaking at an EU summit, proposed replacing Russian LNG with American supplies to ease tensions. Hungarian PM Viktor Orban, a Trump ally, anticipates tough talks but hopes for a beneficial deal. Trump warned the EU about \"paying a big price\" for insufficient U.S. purchases.\n\nJudge Halts Trump 2020 Election Case as DOJ Considers Future Amid Re-Election | N18G A federal judge has paused deadlines in Donald Trump\u2019s 2020 election subversion case following his recent victory in the 2024 presidential election. Prosecutors requested more time, citing the unique situation of his impending return to the White House. DOJ policies generally prevent a sitting president from facing criminal prosecution, prompting discussions on how to proceed with the case.

        "text": "US election: Donald Trump turns down second TV debate with Kamala Harris\nDonald Trump of the Republican party has 77,031,249 votes ( 49.9% )\n\nKamala Harris of the Democrat party has 74,560,685 votes ( 48.3% )\n\nDonald Trump of the Republican party has 312 electoral college votes.\n\nDonald Trump of the Republican party has 312 electoral college votes. 312\n\nKamala Harris of the Democrat party has 226 electoral college votes.\n\nKamala Harris of the Democrat party has 226 electoral college votes. 226\n\nTrump rejects second TV debate as 'too late'\n\nWatch highlights from Trump-Harris clash\n\nFormer US President Donald Trump has said he will not take part in a second TV debate ahead of November's presidential election. While Vice-President Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party's candidate, accepted an invitation to the CNN debate on 23 October, Republican nominee Trump told a rally it was \"too late\" as voting has already started. Harris's campaign team said that given the former president claimed to have won their previous debate in Philadelphia earlier this month he should accept. Snap polls taken after that encounter suggested a majority of viewers believed the vice-president outperformed her challenger.\n\nAfter the 10 September debate, Trump said there would be no further debates. Speaking at a rally in Wilmington, North Carolina on Saturday, he claimed victory in that earlier head-to-head and said \"it's just too late\" for another. \"Voting has already started,\" he said, accusing Harris of seeking another round of sparring \"because she's losing badly.\" Anthony Zurcher analysis: Who won the Harris-Trump debate?\n\nWatch key moments from Harris-Trump clash In a statement on Saturday, Harris-Walz campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon said that Americans \"deserve another opportunity\" to see Harris and Trump debate before the November election. \"It would be unprecedented in modern history for there to just be one general election debate,\" she said. \"Debates offer a unique chance for voters to see the candidates side by side and take stock of their competing visions for America.\" On X, formerly Twitter, Harris said she had \"gladly\" accepted the debate invitation and hoped Trump would also take part. CNN had said the potential debate would follow the same format as the one it broadcast in June between Trump and President Joe Biden. Biden's faltering performance in that encounter led some Democrats to question whether he should be the party's candidate for the election. After weeks of uncertainty the president announced he would not seek re-election - paving the way for Harris to become the nominee.\n\nGetty Images Trump told supporters he won the last debate\n\nAt the Trump rally, some voters told the BBC they hoped another debate would take place. \"If you're not afraid, why not? They both did great [at the last debate],\" said Trump supporter Steve Castellano. Adding that he thought the moderators were \"a little biased\" at the last debate, Mr Castellano suggested some conditions for a possible rematch. Republicans absorb a political shockwave in must-win North Carolina\n\nRos Atkins on... Were the Trump-Harris debate moderators unfair? \"They should debate again at a network Trump chooses,\" he said. \"What I would really love is a good podcaster [to moderate]. I'd really love Joe Rogan to do it.\" Harris holds a slight lead over Trump in national polling averages, and North Carolina could be crucial for his hopes to return to the White House. Since then, a majority of national polls suggest that Harris has made small gains with voters. Trump's campaign stop in North Carolina comes after the Republican candidate he endorsed for governor, Mark Robinson, reportedly made controversial comments on a porn website more than a decade ago. Robinson characterised the CNN report, which alleged that he had referred to himself as a \"black Nazi\" on an adult forum, as \"salacious tabloid lies\". Robinson did not attend Saturday's rally and Trump did not mention it during his 60-minute speech to supporters.\n\nThe two candidates exchanged swipes and barbs at the previous debate, with Trump calling Harris a \"radical left liberal\" and a Marxist who was destroying America. Harris, for her part, goaded Trump, belittled the size of his rally crowds and quoted his Republican detractors. CBS, the BBC's news partner in the US, has also invited both presidential candidates to participate in an October debate in Arizona.",

        "text": "US election: Donald Trump says he probably will not run in 2028 if he loses\nTrump says he will not run again if he loses election\n\nDonald Trump has been the Republican candidate for the last three elections\n\nBut he added that \"hopefully, we're going to be very successful\".\n\nIn an interview with Sinclair Media Group, he was asked if he could foresee another run in the event that he loses to Democratic Vice-President Kamala Harris. \"No, I don't. I think... that will be it,\" Trump said. \"I don't see that at all.\"\n\nTrump, 78, has been the Republican candidate for three national elections in a row and has reshaped the party greatly over the last eight years.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has said he does not expect to run for election again in 2028 if he is defeated in this November's US presidential poll.\n\nUS law bars presidents from serving more than two terms, and so Trump is not expected to run in 2028 if he wins, either.\n\nIn the past, the real estate mogul has rarely acknowledged the possibility of losing the election, more often firing up supporters with speeches and social media posts pledging victory at the polls.\n\nBut this is the second time in four days he has mentioned a chance of defeat.\n\nDuring an event held by the Israeli-American Council on Thursday, he brought up losing, and suggested that any such loss would partly be the fault of Jewish voters.\n\n\"Do they know what the hell is happening if I don't win this election?\" he said, according to various media reports. \"And the Jewish people would have to do a lot with that if that happens because at 40% [support] that means 60% of the people are voting for the enemy.\"\n\nThe comments were condemned by the Harris campaign and by the nonpartisan American Jewish Committee and Anti-Defamation League.\n\nTrump's acknowledgments of a possible loss may reflect how the Democratic Party's prospects have changed since Harris became its nominee following President Joe Biden's decision to quit the race.\n\nHer campaign raised more than $190m (\u00a3142m) in August, compared to $130m brought in by the Trump campaign and affiliated organisations.\n\nIn national polling averages tracked by the BBC she is ahead of Trump, and a poll released on Sunday by CBS indicated she leads Trump 52% to 48% nationally.\n\nIn key US battleground states which look set to prove decisive to the overall result, Harris has a narrower lead of 51% to 49%, which is a slight improvement from the even 50% in a similar poll conducted last month by CBS, the BBC's news partner.\n\nAnother poll released on Sunday by NBC indicated Harris had a five percentage point lead over Trump across the US.\n\nIt also found that 48% of registered voters see her positively compared to 32% in July - the largest jump since then-President George W Bush's favourability surged after the 11 September 2001 attacks.\n\nBut like other surveys, the NBC poll suggested Trump held a clear advantage with voters on some of the election's biggest issues, including the economy, the cost of living and immigration.\n\nThe BBC has contacted the Trump campaign for comment on the polling data.",

        "text": "Harris shows some gains and economic views brighten a bit \u2014 CBS News poll\nCBS News poll: Harris leads by 4 points nationally, but by 2 points in battleground states\n\nThe 2024 presidential race clearly remains a contest either Donald Trump or Kamala Harris can win, CBS News' latest polling finds.\n\nBut with interest rates and gas prices coming down, the number of voters saying the economy is good has ticked up. That, along with a debate voters say was net positive for her, has helped Harris a bit.\n\nThe vice president has now moved to the slightest of edges across the battleground states (it was 50-50 last month), and she is now up 4 points nationally over Donald Trump.\n\nHarris does better with voters who have a positive view of the national economy and of their own personal financial situation.\n\nAnd she wins voters who say the economy is at least getting better, if not good right now. She wins voters who specifically say gas prices around them are going down.\n\nThe challenge that remains for her, though, is that despite the improvement, many voters still don't think things are good. And the ones that don't are voting for Trump.\n\nBut in all, Harris has narrowed her deficit with Trump among those who call the economy a major factor.\n\nThe debate appears to have helped firm up her support: among those who said the debate made them more likely to back her, almost all voted for President Biden in 2020.\n\nVoting on personal qualities or policies\n\nAfter the debate, impressions of the candidates show sharp divisions in the electorate.\n\nPeople who prioritize the personal qualities of a candidate are voting for Harris \u2014 she far outpaces Trump on being personally liked.\n\nThose who say policies are very important are evenly split between them.\n\nAnd a lot of Trump's voters don't like him personally, but do prioritize policies over the personal qualities.\n\nTrump's base remains with him, and that support includes approval of what he claimed about immigrants eating pet dogs and cats.\n\nMost voters think the claims about eating pets are false, but a large majority of Trump backers says they're probably true or certainly true. (The claims have been debunked.)\n\nVoters mostly disapprove of Trump making these claims, but two-thirds of Trump voters approve of his doing so.\n\nBut they qualify it as \"probably\" more than \"certainly\" true, and that designation may signal something less literal. His backers see him as speaking to what they consider a larger issue, that of immigration and its impact on the country.\n\nMore generally, Trump's voters overwhelmingly see immigrants in general as making American society worse, and would overwhelmingly favor his idea of deporting those in the U.S. illegally, an idea that also finds favor with over half of voters overall.\n\nPerceptions of immigrants generally sharply divide the coalitions: Trump wins voters who believe immigrants commit more crimes, and take jobs from citizens; Harris wins voters who think immigrants fill jobs Americans won't do, and are part of what makes America special.\n\nViolence and threats to democracy\n\nMore voters say supporters of Republicans have been engaged in rhetoric that might encourage violence than say so about Democrats' supporters. But the largest single sentiment is that such rhetoric comes from \"both\" sides.\n\nThe apparent Florida assassination attempt against the former president probably galvanized some Trump support, in that those who say it made them more apt to vote for Trump had overwhelmingly already backed him in 2020.\n\nNeither side has much optimism if they lose: Most Harris supporters think the nation will see a higher threat of violence if Trump is elected, and most Trump backers think the nation will see higher threats if Harris is.\n\nEither way, both sides think the overall tone and civility in American politics has gotten worse.\n\nPolitical violence speaks to the idea of democracy more widely, part of which is the idea that people can settle differences peacefully through a process.\n\nBoth sides do think democracy is generally threatened, but this has been the case in our polling for some time and is not new in this campaign.\n\nThis CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a representative sample of 3,129 registered voters nationwide interviewed between September 18-20, 2024. The sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, and education based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and the U.S. Census Current Population Survey, as well as past vote. Respondents were selected to be representative of registered voters nationwide. The margin of error for registered voters is \u00b12.2 points. Battlegrounds are AZ, GA, MI, NC, NV, PA, and WI.",

        "text": "Will the US presidential election define the future of crypto?\nCrypto world hoping for Trump election win\n\nGetty Images While Trump has been forthright about his views on crypto, Harris' position is much less clear\n\nThe cryptocurrency industry is \u201crife with fraud and hucksters and grifters\u201d, one of the United States\u2019 top financial regulators has told the BBC. The chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Gary Gensler, says the \u201cinvesting public around the globe has lost too much money\u201d because of crypto companies not following the laws his agency tries to enforce. It comes as the industry is spending millions of dollars on political donations, trying to influence the outcome of November\u2019s US elections in the hope of more favourable future laws. In addition to the presidential battle between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, all 435 districts in the House of Representatives are up for re-election, as well as 33 of the 100 seats in the Senate.\n\nThe future of cryptocurrency, one of the world\u2019s most hotly-debated technologies, is an issue where there appears to be a clear dividing line between Donald Trump and the outgoing Biden administration. Trump has been courting the votes of crypto enthusiasts by promising to make America \u201cthe crypto capital of the planet\u201d, and creating a \u201cstrategic national bitcoin stockpile\u201d similar to the US government\u2019s gold reserves. Last week he launched a new crypto business called World Liberty Financial, and although he provided few details, he said \u201cI think crypto is one of those things we have to do\u201d. It\u2019s a huge turnaround from three years ago, when he dismissed Bitcoin as something that \u201cseems like a scam\u201d and a threat to the US dollar.\n\nTrump's new-found enthusiasm is a stark contrast to the Biden administration, of which Harris is the vice president. The White House has led a sweeping crackdown on crypto firms in recent years. In March, Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder and boss of FTX was jailed for 25 years for fraud, after he stole billions of dollars from customers around the world, many of whom are still trying to recover their money. Then in April, the founder of the world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange, Binance\u2019s Changpeng Zhao, got four months in prison, and the company paid a $4.3bn (\u00a33.2bn) fine. He admitted to allowing criminals, child abusers and terrorists to launder money on his platform, in a case brought by the US Justice Department. The SEC also has a case against Binance going through the courts. It is one of a record-high 46 enforcement actions the financial regulator took last year against firms trying to profit from what is still an emerging technology.\n\nGetty Images The jailing of crypto boss Sam Bankman-Fried highlighted the worst aspects of the crypto sector\n\n\u201cThis is a field that has come along, and just because they're recording their crypto assets on a new accounting ledger, they [wrongly] say \u2018we don't think we want to comply with the time-tested laws\u2019,\u201d says Mr Gensler. He explains that rules that force companies that want to raise money from the public to \u201cshare certain information\u201d with them have been in place to protect investors since the SEC was created. This was back in 1934, in the aftermath of the infamous Wall Street crash of 1929 that heralded the Great Depression. \u201cCrypto is just a small piece of the US and worldwide capital markets, but it can undermine trust that everyday investors have in the capital markets,\u201d says Mr Gensler. While fans argue that crypto offers a fast, cheap and secure way to move funds, a survey by the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, found that the number of Americans using it has dropped from 12% in 2021 to 7% last year.\n\nHarris has not said much about cryptocurrencies, but one of her advisers did say last month that she would \u201csupport policies that ensure that emerging technologies, and that sort of industry, can continue to grow\u201d. Recent meetings between her team and industry executives have been trying to build trust, and given crypto bosses hope of a brighter future whoever wins in November. \u201cI can't underscore enough how important this is, not just for the US, but for the world,\u201d according to Paul Grewal, who is chief legal officer at crypto firm Coinbase. He has been at these meetings. \u201cNot only is the US an important market for crypto, but so much of the important technology surrounding it has been developed here. And I think it's also critically important that we do not lose sight of the fact that the rest of the world is not simply waiting for the US to get its act together.\u201d He adds that given how tight the race for the White House is, \u201cevery vote is going to count, and crypto votes are no exception\u201d.\n\nGetty Images SEC chair Gary Gensler is highly critical of some cryptocurrency firms\n\nThe clampdown on cryptocurrencies in the US this year has been mirrored in Europe. In April, the European Union agreed new laws to try to reduce the risk of crypto being used by criminals. However, other regulators are being slower to act. The G20 group of leading economies is working on minimum standards for cryptocurrencies, but they are not legally binding, and uptake has been slow. Back in the US, a bill to regulate cryptocurrencies has been passed by the House, but not the Senate. Its critics argue it will give less protection to consumers. Coinbase\u2019s Mr Grewal backs the bill, and says: \u201cThis is not an industry that is shying away from regulation.\u201d He adds that the sector just wants the same standards applied to crypto as are applied to other assets, \u201cno tougher, but no weaker\u201d.",

The 48th Harvard Youth Poll shows Harris leading Trump 64% to 32% among likely voters in a two-way hypothetical scenario with her advantage expanding as young people become more engaged in the electoral process.The poll also finds:A significant enthusiasm gap between young Democrats and Republicans, with 74% of young Democrats saying they will \"definitely\" vote, compared to 60% of young Republicans.A widening gender gap, nearly doubling from 17 points in the Spring poll to 30 points now, with Harris leading 70% to 23% among likely female voters.Harris outperforming Trump on key personal qualities and issues, with substantial leads in empathy (+33), relatability (+24), honesty (+22), climate change (+32), abortion (+31), health care (+26), and gun violence prevention (+25) among all young adults.Harris's job approval as Vice President has significantly improved, increasing from 32% in the Spring poll to 44% now.Strong support for progressive policies among young Americans, with 74% favoring capping prescription drug prices and 59% supporting a nationwide law to legalize abortion.Overwhelming rejection of Project 2025 among young Americans, with only 6% viewing it favorably compared to 48% unfavorably. Even among Republicans, we find 14% viewing it favorably and 23% unfavorably.The impact of social media, with 53% of young adults encountering memes about Harris online in the last month, 34% of whom say it positively influenced their opinion. Conversely, 56% have seen memes about Trump, with 26% reporting a negative impact on their perception.Since 2000, the Harvard Public Opinion Project (HPOP) has provided the most comprehensive look at young Americans' political opinions and voting trends. It provides essential insight into the concerns of young Americans at a time when the nation is confronting numerous challenges both at home and abroad. President Kennedy once said, \"It is a time for a new generation of leadership, to cope with new problems and new opportunities.\" The IOP is preparing a new generation of political leaders to confront these very challenges and gain the ability to successfully lead in today's complicated political landscape. Identifying areas of concern through the Harvard Youth Poll lets tomorrow's political leaders get started on ideas, strategies, and solutions, and allows them to decide today what the next generation of political leadership needs to look like.The first Fall 2024 Harvard Youth Poll surveyed 2,002 young Americans between 18 and 29 years old nationwide, and was conducted between September 4-16, 2024.\"As we head into the final weeks of the 2024 presidential election season, the 48th Harvard Youth Poll serves as a critical barometer about the attitudes, concerns, excitement, and candidate preferences of our nation's young people,\" said IOP Director Setti Warren. \"From climate change, abortion, gun violence, and more, young people are ready yet again to make their voices heard.\"\"This poll reveals a significant shift in the overall vibe and preferences of young Americans as the campaign heads into the final stretch,\" said John Della Volpe, IOP Polling Director. \"Vice President Harris has strengthened the Democratic position among young voters, leading Trump on key issues and personal qualities. Gen Z and young millennials' heightened enthusiasm signals a potentially decisive role for the youth vote in 2024.\"\"In just a few weeks, Vice President Harris has drummed up a wave of enthusiasm among young voters. The shift we are seeing toward Harris is seismic, driven largely by young women. Our poll provides a deep dive into the values of this generation that will drive them to the polls in November,\" said Anil Cacodcar, Chair of the Harvard Public Opinion Project. \"Harris is enjoying a perfect storm of personal appeal, policy support, and positive reach on social media.\"Five key findings from the 48th poll in the series are below.",

        "text": "Elon Poll \u2013 September 24, 2024\nElon Poll finds Harris, Trump too close to call in N.C., and Stein with double-digit lead in governor\u2019s race\n\nFull Report (PDF)\n\nReport Analysis (PDF)\n\nNorth Carolina has emerged as a key battleground state in the presidential race and the Elon University Poll has found the two major party candidates essentially tied with a little more than a month until Election Day.\n\nIn its survey of N.C. registered voters conducted Sept. 4-13, the Elon Poll found that Harris was favored by 46% compared with 45% for Republican Donald Trump. The results are too close to distinguish from one another, with the one-point gap well within the poll\u2019s margin of error of +/- 3.74 percentage points.\n\nThere is a significantly larger margin in North Carolina\u2019s governor\u2019s race with Democrat Josh Stein holding a 14-point lead over Mark Robinson, with 49 percent of voters favoring Stein and 35 percent supporting Robinson. The survey was conducted before recent media reports that Robinson allegedly posted objectionable content and statements on a pornography site.\n\n\u201cIn the big picture, what happens over the next six weeks in North Carolina could determine who leads the United States for the next four years,\u201d said Professor Jason Husser, director of the Elon Poll. \u201cIn the small picture in which, accounting for rounding, Harris and Trump are less than 1 point apart and few undecided likely voters remain, the race down the home stretch for North Carolina\u2019s 16 electoral college votes is now one over inches not yards.\u201d\n\nThis is the second of three surveys planned by the Elon Poll during the fall 2024 election season and was conducted during a period that included the presidential debate on Sept. 10. The survey also assessed which presidential candidate voters prefer on specific issues, how voters think an immigration crackdown could impact the economy and how voters expect artificial intelligence to influence the election.\n\nPresidential race\n\nNorth Carolina is attracting sustained attention from the Harris and the Trump campaigns, with multiple visits to the state this fall as the candidates try to move the needle in the close race. With only a one-point difference in the race, only four percent of registered voters said they had yet to make up their minds on the presidential race. While the overall percentages for the two candidates were very close, there were wide differences among some groups of voters.\n\nMembers of the two major parties favored their own candidates by overwhelming margins but Trump polled stronger among independent voters, receiving 38%, compared with 22% for Harris. Harris drew support from 79% of Black voters compared with only 10% favoring Trump. Harris also led among women voters by 48% to 42%. Male voters are more likely to favor Trump (49%) than Harris (43%) and Trump has a commanding lead of 55% to 37% among white voters.\n\nWhen asked about their overall impressions of the two candidates, voters gave slightly less favorable marks to Trump than when the Elon Poll conducted its last survey in early August. At that time, Trump and Harris were each viewed unfavorably by 50% of voters. In this new poll, Trump was viewed unfavorably by 52% of voters, with Harris viewed unfavorably by 49% of voters. When voters were asked which candidate is someone they would like to have dinner with, one in four voters said neither.\n\nIn questions about the two candidates for vice president, Democrat Tim Walz was viewed as an asset to the Harris campaign by 43% while Republican JD Vance was viewed as an asset to the Trump campaign by 32%.\n\nIn terms of campaign momentum, 45% of N.C. voters said the Harris campaign is gaining support while 34% said the Trump campaign is building momentum. What do voters think about how the media is covering the campaigns? Comparing major media coverage of the campaigns, voters tended to think Harris was benefiting more. Thirty-five percent said reporting on Trump was too negative compared to 7% who said coverage of Harris was too negative.\n\n\u201cBarring a major unforeseen event moving the needle, the details will be decisive for president in North Carolina,\u201d Husser said. \u201cLogistics of voter turnout operations will be essential. Also, critical for each campaign will be priming issues most favorable to their side to the tops of minds among the low percentage of still persuadable voters.\u201d\n\nThe Elon Poll also asked voters to weigh in on which candidate they viewed as strong on specific issues. Voters preferred Harris over Trump on environmental sustainability and were more likely to say she has the right temperament and judgement to be president. Trump led Harris on promoting a healthy and growing economy and solving issues related to immigration and border security.\n\nImmigration has been a top topic during the presidential campaign, with discussions around changing federal policies and the approach to the border. The Elon Poll asked N.C. voters how they think a crackdown on immigration would impact the economy at various levels and found that 54 percent of voters expect such a move to favorably impact the national economy and 47 percent expect it would be a benefit to their local economy.\n\nNorth Carolina governor\u2019s race\n\nThis poll was conducted before the Sept. 19 media reports about objectionable online posts allegedly written by Republican candidate Mark Robinson. In this poll, Democrat Josh Stein was favored by 49% of voters compared with 35% for Robinson. Stein led among both men and women as well as with independent voters and was supported by 78% of Black voters while only 9% of Black voters favored Robinson. Fifty-five percent of voters had a favorable impression of Stein, compared with only 32% with a favorable impression of Robinson.\n\n\u201cNorth Carolina started this cycle with what seemed the most competitive and most impactful governor\u2019s race in the nation,\u201d Husser said. \u201cThe race is no longer particularly competitive given Josh Stein\u2019s historically unusual lead over Mark Robinson. However, potential remains for the race to be the most impactful if voters respond to negativity around Robinson by associating their opinions about him with other Republicans, both up and down the ballot.\u201d\n\nThe issue of abortion restrictions continues to be important for voters as they consider their votes for governor. Seventeen percent said the abortion issue is their highest priority and 49% said it is an important priority. Only 17% favored increased restrictions on abortion while 47% favored decreased restrictions.\n\nElection concerns\n\nThe Elon Poll has been tracking voter opinions about the integrity of this year\u2019s election and again found serious concerns about the accuracy of the vote count and how artificial intelligence could impact the election.\n\nOnly 50% said they believe this year\u2019s election will produce a fair and accurate count of the votes cast nationwide.\n\n65% said it\u2019s likely that people working for either of the major political parties will try to fraudulently change the election outcome; this view was held equally by Republicans, Democrats and independents\n\n56% were concerned that voters will be intimidated or harassed when going to the polls, including 68% of Democrats who hold that concern. More than seven in 10 voters were concerned about election-related violence breaking out shortly after the election or around the Inauguration.\n\n41% said they had little or no confidence that most Americans will accept the results of the presidential election.\n\n80% said the use of artificial intelligence to manipulate social media will affect the outcome of the presidential election.\n\n\u201cOn worries ranging from violence to election inaccuracy to AI manipulation, we continue to find a wary electorate on edge in North Carolina,\u201d Husser said. \u201cHowever, voters indicate that all optimism is not lost with only 12 percent referring to America\u2019s future in decline compared to 58 percent saying difficult or uncertain and 22 percent saying bright or prosperous.\u201d\n\nPoll Methodology\n\nThis survey was constructed by the Elon University Poll in partnership with The Charlotte Observer, The News & Observer and The Durham Herald-Sun and fielded by the international marketing and polling firm YouGov as an online, web-based survey, self-administered with online panels. YouGov interviewed 940 respondents who were registered voters in North Carolina. These respondents were then matched down to a sample of 800 to produce the final dataset.\n\nThroughout this report, the analysis of partisan differences compares the views of Republicans plus those who lean Republican in their voting preference with Democrats plus those who lean Democratic. A sample composition file from the survey provides more details.\n\nThe margin of error for this poll (adjusted for weights) is +/-3.74%.",

        "text": "University of Houston Maintains Top 75 Status in U.S. News and World Report Rankings\nThe University of Houston is once again ranked among the nation\u2019s top 75 public universities in the 2025 U.S. News & World Report Top Public School rankings, landing at No. 74. Despite a slight shift from last year\u2019s rank of No. 70, UH has continued to make significant strides in key student success metrics, which remain central to the University\u2019s mission of improving educational outcomes.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased to remain in the top 75 public universities, especially in such a competitive field,\u201d said UH President Renu Khator. \u201cWhile rankings fluctuate, what matters most is our continued focus on student success and the steady progress we are making in that area.\u201d\n\nThese 2025 rankings come as UH improved in its six-year graduation rate, now at 65%, marking a 14 percentage point increase since 2015. The University\u2019s one-year retention rate also saw gains, further strengthening its focus on student success. UH continues to shine in social mobility, ranking No. 36 among all national universities \u2014 both public and private \u2014 a testament to the University\u2019s commitment to creating opportunities for students from diverse backgrounds. U.S. News removed metrics related to the success of first-generation students in the latest ranking methodology, which resulted in UH losing points compared to last year.\n\nThe U.S. News rankings, which measure various academic and student performance metrics, place UH in a highly competitive landscape where only five points separate UH from the top 50 public universities. The University anticipates that as graduation rates continue to rise, particularly the goal of reaching a 70% graduation rate, it will experience more substantial movement in the rankings in the coming years.\n\nIn addition to the U.S. News & World Report rankings, UH continues to perform well across other academic disciplines, including:\n\nNational Universities: #144\n\nTop Public Schools - National Universities: #74\n\nSocial Mobility - National Universities: #36\n\nBest Undergraduate Business: #65\n\nBest Undergraduate Engineering (Doctorate): #79\n\nBest Undergraduate Nursing: #96\n\n\u201cAs we continue our progress toward becoming a top 50 public university, our vision remains clear, and our commitment to student success unwavering. We expect to see even greater gains as we build on the foundation we have set,\u201d Khator said. \u201cOur community, students and supporters can rest assured that we will continue to strive for excellence in every area that matters most.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, UH cracked the top 50 in the Forbes rankings, climbing 22 spots. Every ranking has its own methodology and scoring system, highlighting different aspects of institutional success.",

        "text": "Impact of the US election on the FX market\nKamala Harris vs Donald Trump: a tight race\n\nCurrently, Democratic nominee Kamala Harris holds a narrow lead over Republican nominee Donald Trump, according to most betting markets and polls. Her controlled performance during the presidential debate on 10 September has contributed to this lead.\n\nHowever, remembering how Trump outperformed predictions in 2016, the race is still considered too close to call. This uncertainty keeps markets on edge just weeks before the election.\n\nHow does the US election outcome impact the FX market?\n\nIn addition to the presidential election, 468 seats in the US Congress (33 of the 100 Senate seats and all 435 House seats) are up for election on 5 November 2024.\n\nCurrently, the House is under Republican control, while the Senate has a Democratic majority. This division is known as a 'divided government'. Since 1980, every US president has faced a divided government at some point, hampering their ability to implement preferred policies.\n\nUnlike the sweeping victories of 2020 (Blue Democratic Sweep) and 2016 (Red Republican Sweep), a divided government is likely in 2024. Despite this, the US President holds significant authority over trade policy, differentiating it from other areas like taxation and fiscal policy. This makes trade policy a key channel through which the 2024 election could impact foreign exchange (FX) markets.\n\nRepublican victory\n\nTrump has signalled he would raise tariffs on Chinese imports to 60% or higher if re-elected. Such a move could negatively impact growth expectations outside the US and might prompt foreign officials to respond in kind or devalue their currencies to offset these tariffs' economic impact. Additionally, the US could face higher inflation, leading to increased interest rates.\n\nA Republican sweep of both houses of Congress (a Red Sweep) could also lead to considerable fiscal expansion, characterised by higher spending, lower taxes, and rising debt. This scenario would likely strengthen the US dollar due to heightened expectations for US economic growth and higher interest rates.\n\nDemocratic victory\n\nA Democratic victory, whether partial or full, would likely mean a continuation of policies from the Biden administration, which have been tied to mild US dollar weakness.\n\nHarris is expected to pursue less fiscal expansion than Trump, resulting in less growth. Additionally, inflation is projected to decrease, leading to lower real interest rates, which are generally negative for the currency.",

        "text": "Election Results, Canvass, and Certification\nHave you ever wondered what happens to your ballot after you get your I Voted Sticker? After the polls close, ballots and electronic vote records are securely transferred to the elections office. Election officials make election results public as quickly as possible. However, even when those results say \u201c100% Precincts Reporting,\u201d they are still unofficial.\n\nThe process of reporting, canvassing, and certifying election results takes a great deal of work. This page contains information about how election results change from unofficial to official as well as best practices and resources to help election officials communicate this essential process to voters. While detailed information about post-election audit processes is not included here, more information about audits can be found in the EAC report Election Audits Across the United States.\n\nAdditionally, election officials can use the Communicating Election and Post-Election Processes Toolkit to create educational materials about pre- and post-election processes that observers and the public can understand. Election officials in any size jurisdiction can adapt this toolkit to fit their observer and voter education needs.\n\nThe election results reported on election night are never the final, certified results. Election officials well know there are various other steps and factors that impact when election results are final. Communicating that information with the public can be a challenge. Voters look to election officials for trusted information about election results. How election officials display election results can play a key role in facilitating public confidence in election outcomes.\n\nElection officials can use the Checklist for Securing Election Night Results Reporting as a baseline to assess their current Election Night Reporting cybersecurity protocols. These protocols would be in addition to other physical and administrative procedures election officials implement to ensure data reliability, including documented chain of custody, data verification procedures, and using certified technology to tabulate vote totals.\n\nChecklist for Securing Election Night Results Reporting\n\nTo help communicate the nuances of this process,the resources below help provide context when voters are viewing election results online.\n\nBest Practices: Election Results Reporting\n\nPoster Format\n\nPresentation Format\n\nLeading up to the 2020 general election, the EAC hosted a discussion on preparing for election night reporting and press coverage on election results. Speakers offered remarks on issues surrounding misinformation and disinformation, unofficial results, managing expectations, ballots received after the election, and audits. Joining the EAC Commissioners were New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver, Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate; Brian Carovillano, Vice President and Managing Editor of the Associated Press; and Nate Persily, Professor of Law, Stanford Law School. Watch a recording of the event below.\n\nThe canvass is a culmination of all the data generated during an election cycle. More importantly, it is a process that allows election officials to confirm the accuracy of election data and identify areas for improvement. The canvass process aggregates and confirms every valid ballot cast and counted, including mail, uniformed and overseas citizen, early voting, Election Day, and provisional ballots.\n\nElection officials can find information about the canvass process in the best practices guide below, Guide to the Canvass. This document includes best practices for conducting post-election canvasses, including checklists for key parts of the canvass.\n\nGuide to the Canvass\n\nVoters may have questions about the canvass process, and how this process ensures that election results are both secure and accurate. The resources below are intended to help election officials explain this process to their voters.\n\nElection Certification\n\nElection certification refers to the process of election officials attesting that the election results are a true and accurate accounting of all votes cast in a particular election.\n\nImportantly, the results reported on election night are not final even though the media may call the projected winner of races. Only election officials provide official election results. There are several steps election officials complete before they certify final election results. The figure below outlines the typical processes election officials perform before final, official results are certified. Not all jurisdictions follow each procedure outlined, or they may conduct them in a different order.\n\nImage Image Image Image Unofficial results are published after the polls close on election night and continue to be released until all ballots are counted. Election results are unofficial until they are certified. During the canvass, election officials reconcile the number of mail, early, and election day ballots cast with the number of voters. The purpose of the canvass is to make sure that every valid vote is included in the final results. Most states require a post-election audit to verify voting equipment used during an election correctly counted votes. The timing and method of post-election audits differ among states. Election officials issue a written statement of certification attesting that the election results are a true and accurate accounting of all votes cast in a particular election.\n\nImpact of Recounts\n\nIn addition to the steps included above, recounts may impact the timeline for final election certification depending on state law. For example, New Hampshire law specifies that state certification takes place after the deadline for a recount has expired. Similarly, in West Virginia, counties must certify results within 30 days of the election or, if there is a recount, within 30 days of completing the recount.\n\nA recount typically includes an additional count of votes cast to make sure the ballots were counted accurately. Each state has its own laws regarding the process for initiating a recount. Typically, recounts are initiated in one of the following ways:\n\nA candidate for office requests a recount\n\nA voter who participated in the election requests a recount\n\nThe vote margin falls within a legally required recount threshold\n\nA judge issues a court order to recount a contest\n\nFor requested recounts, state law may require the requestor to pay a set fee or the cost of the recount. Although no federal uniform statutory timeline exists for recounts, any recount would need to be resolved before statutory deadlines for transmission of certificates of ascertainment containing the names of the presidential electors and other candidates taking office.\n\nWho certifies election results and when?\n\nWhen polls close, local election officials will report unofficial election results to the public and if it is a state or federal election to their respective states. State election offices will aggregate data and report unofficial results for State and Federal offices, including President and Vice President. Then, after every valid vote has been included in the final results, and all required processes have been completed, the election results will be certified.\n\nCertification of election results at both the local and state level varies between states and sometimes even between local jurisdictions within a state depending on the contest being certified. Localities may have a multi-member board or a single elected election official, like a county auditor or municipal clerk, who certify results. At the state level, results may be certified by a single elected official (for example the Secretary of State or Governor), the state legislative body, an appointed election director, or by a multi-member board. Certifying a presidential election involves an additional set of deadlines and players\u2014namely, electors. When voters cast their votes for President and Vice President, they are choosing a slate of electors to send to the Electoral College. Several states have a different timeline for the certification of the presidential race versus other Federal offices due to deadlines associated with the Electoral College.\n\nThe following table provides an estimated certification timeline for each state\u2019s local and state election officials to certify the 2024 general election results for federal offices. Estimated dates are for general informational purposes only. In the event a jurisdiction must recount a contest, it may impact the certification deadline. State and local election officials are the authorities on election certification dates.\n\nCalifornia\n\nYolo County\n\nHarnessing Technology to Improve Polling Place Resources and Response Time, Strengthen Voter Communications, and Increase Future Turnout which has streamlined election night reporting and improve voter participation.\n\nIn 2018, the county harnessed GIS Systems and Mapping, along with a new poll worker app, to streamline election night reporting and improve voter participation. The Elections Office partnered with the county\u2019s Information Technology division of the General Services Department to attain several innovative successes. The effort resulted in improved resource allocation, greater response time to polling places, strengthened communication of election results to citizens, and the likelihood of increasing future turnout through targeted outreach and education.\n\nhttps://www.eac.gov/election-officials/yolo-county-elections-office-ca-2019-clearinghouse-award-winner\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nDurham County\n\nWait-Time Tracker for Early Voting\n\nThis innovative app allowed voters to locate polling places closest to them, view voting information, and see current polling place wait times. Users could also find bus routes or get GPS directions. The results from using this application were extremely positive for both election workers and voters. In the 2020 General Election, over 48% of registered voters in Durham County chose to vote early. This new service helped to alleviate crowds at busy polling places by offering alternatives, provided voters with streamlined real-time information, and fostered staffing needs for early in-person locations.\n\nhttps://www.eac.gov/election-officials/durham-county-board-elections-nc-2020-clearinghouse-award-winner\n\nUtah\n\nUtah County\n\nGIS Solutions\n\nThe Elections Division and GIS Department in Utah County collaborated on the use of GIS software to improve ballot security, public accountability, office efficiency, and real-time reporting and technology. Three major solutions were developed: a public-facing election results map, a secure dropbox ballot tracker dashboard, and a public-facing real-time ballot workflow dashboard system. These efforts accelerated the ballot counting process, increased security of dropbox information, provided data analysis to improve future elections, and reduced bottom-line costs.\n\nhttps://www.eac.gov/election-officials/utah-county-elections-division-and-gis-department-ut-2020-clearinghouse-award",

Northampton County could hold the answer\nNorthampton County could hold clues to who will win Pennsylvania in 2024 election\n\nNorthampton County could hold clues to who will win Pennsylvania in 2024 election\n\nNorthampton County could hold clues to who will win Pennsylvania in 2024 election\n\nEASTON, Pa. (CBS) \u2014 The road to the White House in 2024 likely runs through Pennsylvania. As Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump jockey for votes in seven key swing states, Pennsylvania's 19 electoral votes stand out.\n\nEveryone wants to know which way the state will swing in November, and one place may provide some answers: Northampton County.\n\n\"I'm not a political pundit, but history is what it is,\" Lamont McClure, a Northampton County executive, said. \"And we usually call it the right way here.\"\n\nNorthampton County certainly has history on its side. In 2016, Northampton County swung for Trump after backing former President Barack Obama twice, just as the state did. Pennsylvania swang back blue for President Biden four years later, as did Northampton County. The county has matched the state's presidential pick in every election dating back to 1948, when Northampton County broke for Democrat Harry Truman while the state swung for Republican Thomas Dewey.\n\nTruman would win that 1948 election, showing Northampton County is also pretty good at picking presidents. The state has voted for the person who ultimately won the presidency in all but three elections since 1920.\n\nWith much focus on Pennsylvania during the 2024 election's homestretch, county officials say they're getting quite the reputation.\n\n\"We have crews from China and Europe wanting to come here to interview us about our processes as if this is some magic 8 ball or the bottom of a teacup to read the leaves,\" McClure said. \"It's not.\"\n\nInstead, McClure says Northampton County is more of a reflection of the state itself. Party registration is very closely divided, with McClure saying Democrats have a slight edge. The county has urban areas like Bethlehem and Easton and more rural areas to the north.\n\n\"Above [Route] 22 is pretty much ruby red in Northampton County. And along 22 becomes like a lighter blue. And below, especially in the City of Bethlehem, it becomes a dark blue,\" McClure said. \"We're very purple, and Pennsylvania is very purple. So our demographics are very similar to the demographics in the rest of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania. So, generally speaking overall, the way we vote is the way the rest of the commonwealth's going to come out overall.\"\n\nPolitical analysts know the importance of this area to winning in Pennsylvania, and they'll be watching it closely.\n\n\"Much of the action is going to be right in here, including in the Lehigh Valley,\" said CBS News Director of Elections and Surveys Anthony Salvanto, referring to a swath of southeastern and east-central Pennsylvania from Northampton County south to Philadelphia.\n\nThat raises the question: What are Northampton County voters thinking about the 2024 race for the White House? We spent Tuesday afternoon in downtown Easton talking with them to find out.\n\n\"It's definitely a tough decision,\" Cristian Duarte, a small business owner from Bethlehem Township, said.\n\n\"I'm a ball of anxiety,\" Nick Loessy, a Harris supporter from Easton, said.\n\n\"I'm real confused,\" Melissa Mazgajewski from Walnutport said.\n\nSome voters we spoke with Tuesday say their minds have been made up for a while.\n\nLoessy is backing Harris, saying he would vote for anybody but Trump. John McCann of Easton said he's supporting the former president because he believes he's \"the most qualified\" for the job.\n\nBut most people we talked with around Centre Square were still undecided.\n\n\"What [Trump] did in his term to really help boost the economy,\" Duarte said. \"And then, you know, you hear all the crazy. So it sways you in a different direction.\"\n\n\"Kamala had an opportunity to change things the last four years, and she didn't,\" Mazgajewski said. \"Trump had an opportunity to do better as far as promoting himself and he didn't. So it's like, who do you choose?\"\n\n\"I don't really think either one of the candidates we have so far is super. I don't know, they're not really doing anything for my needs,\" Nick Chun of Easton said.\n\nBut all of these undecided voters we spoke with Tuesday say they do plan on voting in November.\n\nThe economy was top of mind for voters in Easton, with multiple people saying they're looking for a candidate who will make life more affordable. Reproductive rights were another issue that came up.\n\nIn 2020, there was a tight race between President Biden and Trump in Pennsylvania, which carried over to Northampton County, and Biden won the bellwether area by just over 1,200 votes.\n\nVoters say they expect more of the same this time around. With 42 days to decide, many tell us it'll likely come down to the wire.\n\n\"I'm trying to give both parties the chance to persuade me or get me on their side,\" Jordan from Easton said.\n\n\"Yeah, I'm there. I could sway in either direction,\" Duarte said.\n\nHowever, McClure was the only person who wouldn't make a prediction, saying that this would only be a fair and secure election in Northampton County.\n\n\"Half of us aren't going to like the result,\" McClure said. \"But as long as we all feel good about the process, I will consider that a victory for Northampton County.\"",

        "text": "Q&A: Cecilia Menj\u00edvar on authoritarian tactics in the 2024 U.S. presidential campaign\nThe heated 2024 U.S. presidential election is frequently characterized as a choice between democracy and dictatorship, or democracy and autocracy, especially with the publication of Project 2025, the extreme, far-right playbook supposedly written for a Donald Trump or other Republican administration.\n\nIt may be surprising then, that in many examples, autocrats around the world have used institutions of democracy to consolidate and gain autocratic power.\n\nUCLA sociology professor Cecilia Menj\u00edvar, who co-edited a recent double issue of American Behavioral Scientist for which she also co-wrote the introduction, \u201cThe Tools of Autocracy Worldwide: Authoritarian Networks, the Fa\u00e7ade of Democracy, and Neo-Repression, with UCLA alumna and USC assistant professor of sociology Deisy Del Real, breaks down how dictators have deftly shepherded societies and political systems into autocracies worldwide.\n\nBy exploring the use of fear, the deliberate spread of misinformation, deceptive use of democratic systems, corruption of the legal system and the harnessing of hate groups, the co-editors hope to shed light on the fragility of democracy and sharpen our critical eye to the insidious threat of autocracy.\n\nWe sat down with Menj\u00edvar, the Dorothy L. Meier Social Equities Professor at UCLA, to learn more about the tools and tactics used by aspiring and actual autocratic leaders.\n\nHow do politicians use fear to justify authoritarian rule?\n\nFear is an efficient and malleable tactic that serves several purposes. First, it allows politicians to create enemies out of anyone, whether scientists, intellectuals, immigrants, academics, reporters or, of course, the opposition.\n\nA sweeping \u201cus\u201d versus \u201cthem\u201d binary proves quite useful in politics. It creates a doom-and-gloom scenario of a country where anything and anyone can be identified as a threat. Once people are fearful of their co-workers, neighbors, friends or anyone with a different opinion, they become highly receptive to the idea that the problems of a given society are too big and only someone powerful can eradicate them. The autocrat who talks constantly about apocalyptic threats thus becomes the only savior of the nation.\n\nHow and why do aspiring and actual authoritarians manipulate information in mass media?\n\nManipulating the media, especially social media, is one of the most powerful tools autocrats use today. Social media platforms instantaneously transmit and retransmit politicians\u2019 messages, potentially reaching everyone who owns a smartphone anywhere in the world.\n\nAspiring and actual autocrats use social media to spread (mis)information about supposed enemies and purported existential threats to the nation, neighborhoods and families. It\u2019s how they reach the hearts and minds of the public, who are constantly exposed to messages laced with misinformation and distortions.\n\nReceiving posts from a powerful leader daily on your phone has huge psychological impact: It shows that the leader cares and is personally involved in protecting her or his followers. All of which bolsters the claim that she or he is the only one who can save you.\n\nMany people are confused by the idea that candidates and politicians in a democratic system can openly pursue authoritarian goals. How does this work?\n\nResearch has clearly established that the demarcation between democracy and autocracy is not as clear-cut as we might assume. As more leaders around the world resort to autocratic means to attain and retain power (think of Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orb\u00e1n, India\u2019s Narendra Modi, El Salvador\u2019s Nayib Bukele, Turkey\u2019s Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, Nicaragua\u2019s Daniel Ortega, the Philippines\u2019 Rodrigo Duterte, Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin, Venezuela\u2019s Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and China\u2019s Xi Jinping, to name a few), this line is increasingly blurred. We see this trend in established and nascent democracies, in governments on the left and right and in wealthy and poor countries.\n\nPoliticians in a democratic system can and do pursue autocratic goals. The interesting twist is that aspiring (and established) autocrats do not seek to destroy democracy completely because it is precisely the tools of democracy that allow them to attain power. At the same time, they consciously seek to dismantle essential pillars of democracy and its institutions, such as the rule of law and checks and balances in government, once they are in power.\n\nAfter attaining power through free and democratic elections, they corrupt the legal system, the courts and the very election process to enable them to remain in power indefinitely, with no chance of a serious contender.\n\nHow do authoritarian candidates use to their advantage civil society movements and groups that espouse hate and violence?\n\nLeaders with autocratic goals do not act alone; they need supporters, especially civil society groups who work to gain followers. This is important in a democratic context, where dynamic civic engagement is the norm. It helps autocrats maintain a fa\u00e7ade of democracy.\n\nCivil society groups are critically important for amplifying and spreading a leader\u2019s messages on the ground, as those messages become more powerful when people share them with conviction with friends, family and people they work, pray or play with. Autocrats effectively mobilize these groups to attack anyone a leader categorizes as the \u201cenemy.\u201d\n\nThese groups include a range of followers, including hate groups and trolls, who use a variety of strategies to confront enemies identified by a leader, including psychological and physical threats to these individuals and their families. Those tactics work to coerce people to be less vocal in their criticism. Because autocrats signal hate groups and trolls to work on their behalf, these groups feel powerful and personally connected to the leader.\n\nWhat role do these tactics play in Project 2025, the detailed plan for conservative policies prepared by the Heritage Foundation for the next Republican president?\n\nWe are used to thinking of autocrats as individuals \u2014 (mostly) men acting alone \u2014 because those are the images we see. But behind these individuals are vast networks of influential people. Just as they need civil society groups to advance their goals, autocratic politicians also rely on a wide range of interconnected powerful networks of experts, political strategists, legal specialists and authors who help spread their message and construct a positive image to legitimize the autocrats. This group, however, mostly works behind the scenes.\n\nThese are networks of like-minded individuals who see personal benefit in establishing an autocratic government. The Conservative Promise (commonly known as Project 2025), for example, is a blueprint for consolidating power and doing away with most institutions we associate with U.S. democracy.\n\nThe 34 organizations and hundreds of contributors organized by The Heritage Foundation to author this 922-page document include experts across different fields. The advisory board includes The American Principles Project, Center for Immigration Studies, Claremont Institute, Concerned Women for America, Family Research Council, Foundation for Defense of Democracies, James Madison Institute, Liberty University and Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, among others \u2014 revealing the powerful networks behind the individual we see on camera.\n\nWhat role do these tactics play in the ongoing U.S. immigration policy debate?\n\nThe purported threat of immigrants and immigration is perhaps one of the best examples of autocrats\u2019 strategy of creating an \u201cus\u201d versus \u201cthem\u201d dynamic that keeps followers fearful and receptive to hostile policies, a tactic that also precludes discussion of sensible policy choices.\n\nThis is part of an autocratic \u201ctoolbox\u201d of tactics that reinforce each other: The autocrat spews hateful rhetoric at the same time that he makes the public believe that he\u2019s the only one who can save them from that threat, which goes to the root of autocratic power \u2014 the concentration of power in one individual who will hold absolute power to corrupt institutions, undermine the rule of law, etc. This is quite different from other inhumane treatment of immigrants.\n\nI do think that there\u2019s a lot in common across recent administrations and historically, too. I\u2019m reading a book about the unspeakable violence that Chinese immigrants experienced in the years surrounding the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. There was definitely an \u201cus\u201d versus \u201cthem\u201d rhetoric that incited violence against these immigrants, not too different from the rhetoric about Springfield, Ohio, in the past few weeks.\n\nGiven the long history of hostility toward certain immigrant groups in the United States, these narratives make sense to an already fearful public and provide justification for the inhumane treatment of immigrants, as we have witnessed in the case of immigrant detention and child separation practices of current and previous administrations.",

        "text": "China is part of the US election - but only from one candidate\nChina is part of the US election - but only from one candidate\n\nThe US and China are the two largest economies in the world. They have the two most powerful militaries in the world. The US-China rivalry, in the view of many international analysts, will be the defining global theme of the 21st Century.\n\nBut at the moment, only one of the two major party presidential candidates is regularly talking about US-China policy - as he has done consistently for years.\n\nAccording to a review by BBC Verify, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has mentioned China 40 times in his five rallies since the presidential debate earlier this month. In just one hour at a town hall forum last week in Michigan, he brought up the country 27 times.\n\nAnd when he talks about China, Trump focuses on matters of tension between the two global powers, painting the country and the world\u2019s second-largest economy, as a kind of economic predator.\n\nHe has talked about the new tariffs he plans to impose on imports from Chinese companies \u2013 and those from other nations - should he return to the White House.\n\nHe has said he wants to prevent Chinese-made cars from being sold because he believes they will destroy the American auto industry. He has warned China not to attempt to replace the US dollar as the world\u2019s reserve currency. And he has blamed the Chinese government for the Covid pandemic.\n\nMany economists question the effectiveness of Trump\u2019s tariff plans and warn that they would ultimately be harmful to US consumers. The Biden-Harris administration, however, has maintained, and even at times increased, the more narrowly focused tariffs that Trump imposed on China during his first term in office.\n\nTrump\u2019s protectionist message is tailored to blue-collar voters in the key industrial Midwest battleground states who have felt the impact of increased competition from Chinese manufacturers.\n\nMeanwhile, BBC Verify finds, Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris did not mention China at all in her six rallies since the 10 September debate. Although, in a speech on the economy in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on Wednesday afternoon, she made a handful of references to the country.\n\n\u201cI will never hesitate to take swift and strong measures when China undermines the rules of the road at the expense of our workers, communities, and companies,\u201d she said at that event.\n\nAsked for comment, an aide to the vice-president told the BBC that even if Harris does not talk about China regularly, she has a record of working to counter what they described as China\u2019s efforts to undermine global stability and prosperity.\n\nBut when it comes to discussing China, the contrast between Trump and Harris on the campaign trail is unmistakable.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, at a barn in Smithton, a small town in rural western Pennsylvania, Trump sat down with a group of local farmers and ranchers for a roundtable discussion specifically about China.\n\nThe town may be just an hour outside of Pittsburgh, a Democratic Party urban stronghold, but this was decidedly Republican territory. Cows grazed peacefully on grasslands lined with dozens of \u201cTrump for President signs\u201d, while Trump supporters decorated two donkeys in \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d gear.\n\nThe topic of the event, hosted by the Protecting America Initiative, a conservative think-tank, was \u201cthe Chinese Communist Party's growing threat to the US food supply\u201d.\n\nThe forum ended up being a more open-ended conversation about the threat of China, full stop. The farmers, ranchers and business executives on the panel complained about having to compete with heavily subsidised Chinese imports and about the low quality of Chinese goods.\n\nWhile the former president didn\u2019t spend much time discussing the perceived dangers of Chinese ownership of US farmland \u2013 he instead promised that he would convince Chinese President Xi Jinping to buy more US agriculture exports \u2013 he again emphasised that he would use tariffs to shield the American economy from China.\n\nAt one point, he spoke of the need to protect the US steel industry - in order to prepare for a hypothetical war with China.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re in a war, and we need army tanks and we need ships and we need other things that happen to be made of steel, what are we going to do, go to China and get the steel?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe\u2019re fighting China, but would you mind selling us some steel?\u201d\n\nSome of the heavier lifting on China during the forum was left to Richard Grenell, a roundtable panelist and senior advisor for the Protecting America Initiative.\n\nHe warned the country has \u201cquietly but strategically\u201d worked against the US \u2013 particularly when Americans were distracted by other global issues.\n\n\u201cThey go after our local and state politicians; they go after our manufacturing,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no question they are looking to, at some point, leverage that investment and activity.\u201d\n\nGrenell, who served as US ambassador to Germany and acting director of national intelligence while Trump was in office, is considered a possible secretary of state - America\u2019s top diplomat - if Trump wins another term in November.\n\nIf Harris wins, on the other hand, there may not be a significant change from the current Biden administration, even if the current president has frequently deployed sharper rhetoric to describe the US-China rivalry.",

Zelensky will meet Trump on Friday despite earlier reports that the meeting had been cancelled.\n\nIt comes amid a row with Donald Trump and the Republican party ahead of November's US presidential election.\n\nDetails have been kept secret, but Zelensky is likely to ask the US president and vice-president for continuing military and financial support, as well as security guarantees.\n\nVolodymyr Zelensky is meeting Joe Biden and Kamala Harris at the White House to discuss his \"victory plan\", which the Ukrainian president hopes will pressure Russia into agreeing a diplomatic end to the war.\n\nZelensky's visit to the ammunition factory in the key swing state of Pennsylvania was labelled by leading Republicans as a partisan campaign event.\n\nIn a public letter, speaker of the US House Mike Johnson said the visit was \"designed to help Democrats\" and claimed it amounted to \"election interference\".\n\nHe also demanded that Ukraine fire its ambassador to Washington who helped arrange the visit.\n\nThe Republican-led House Oversight Committee has also announced it would investigate whether Zelensky's trip was an attempt to use a foreign leader to benefit Harris's campaign.\n\nHer Republican rival for the presidency, Donald Trump, mocked Zelensky at a campaign event as the \"greatest salesman on Earth\" and accused him of refusing to \"make a deal\" with Moscow.\n\nEarlier this week, Trump also praised Russia's military capabilities, saying: \"They beat Hitler, they beat Napoleon - that\u2019s what they do, they fight.\"\n\nThe two men have long had a fractious relationship. In 2019, Trump was impeached by the US House over accusations that he pressured Ukraine's leader to dig up damaging information on a political rival.\n\nThe row clouded a week in which Zelensky has twice addressed the United Nations, ramping up efforts to persuade the US and other allies to boost support more than two and a half years into Russia's full-scale invasion.\n\nAt the White House meetings, Zelensky is expected to push again for US backing to fire Western-made long-range missiles deep into Russian territory, which Biden has so far blocked.\n\nBefore the meeting, Biden said: \"Let me be clear, Russia will not prevail in war... Ukraine will prevail\".\n\nHe also pledged to support Kyiv \"in its path to membership to both the EU and Nato\".\n\nMeanwhile, Zelensky thanked the US for its \"unwavering bipartisan support\".\n\nHe later met Harris, with the vice-president reiterating her support for Ukraine and arguing the US must continue its role of global leadership.\n\nWith Russian troops advancing in the east of Ukraine, the outcome of Zelensky's meeting with Biden and Harris is seen by many experts as a key moment in his attempt to shore up US support before the November election.\n\nOn Wednesday, Russia's Vladimir Putin announced a plan to revise Moscow's nuclear doctrine, to enable Russia to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states if they are supported by nuclear states.\n\nPutin's spokesperson later clarified that it was meant as a \"specific signal\" to the West.",

        "text": "Sick of polls? Here are 2 other ways to measure the presidential race\nEvery day we are bombarded with polls telling us where the presidential race is. There are polls of the nation and polls of the swing states. There are so many polls that it\u2019s hard to keep up. As we know, polls are merely a snapshot in time, subject to large variations and, at this point at least, they cannot foretell the future with any accuracy.\n\nSo, putting aside the polls, what other indicators are there on the state of the race? Until early voting begins, the two most important are voter registration and campaign donations.\n\nThis year, the most frequently discussed voter registration indicator was visits generated by Taylor Swift\u2019s Instagram endorsement of Vice President Harris\u2019 candidacy, which included a custom URL that her followers could visit to register to vote. The federal government\u2019s General Services Administration (GSA) confirmed that 405,999 visitors were directed to the site in the 24 hours following Swift\u2019s \u201cchildless cat lady\u201d posting. More than 80,000 of them used the site to verify their registration status. At least 27,000 new voter registrations were generated the day following the posting, suggesting the endorsement was \u201cswiftly\u201d changing the composition of the November electorate.\n\nBut how many of these new registrants will turn out to vote?\n\nData collected by the U.S. Census Bureau suggests what\u2019s likely to happen. It indicates that failure to register to vote is the greatest barrier to casting a ballot; once registered, the large majority of Americans of all ages vote. For instance, in the 2020 presidential election, 50.8% of 18- to 24-year-olds were registered and 86% of those cast a ballot. In that election, 70.15% of those 25 to 44 years old registered to vote, and 89.3% of them voted. Voter registration for those between 45 and 64 was 75.65%, while 93.7% of registered voters in the age cohort turned out. Among those 65 and older, 78.45% were registered to vote, and 94.8% of registered voters cast a ballot. These numbers suggest that around 80% of those who registered as a result of Taylor Swift\u2019s endorsement posting will join the voting electorate this fall. Using the census data, the voting turnout percentages were calculated by dividing the number of those in an age cohort that voted in 2020 by the number of those in the cohort that were registered to vote that year.\n\nThis year, we have the benefit of a more comprehensive and current set of data on voter registration thanks to TargetSmart, a company that provides data-based consultation to political campaigns, businesses, and other organizations. They constantly update their files to record publicly available voter data, such as registration or early voting. When Target Smart analyzed the first wave of voter registration data from July, following \u201cthe switch\u201d in the Democratic nominee, it found \u201cincredible surges in voter registration relative to the same time period in 2020\u2026especially [among] women, voters of color, and young voters.\u201d Not coincidentally, those are the demographic groups that virtually all surveys suggest will be the key to Vice President Harris\u2019 efforts to generate significant margins over Trump.\n\nIn the week after Vice President Harris became the Democratic nominee, TargetSmart\u2019s report, based on data released by 38 states, found that women accounted for nearly 55% of all new registrants recorded. The July 2024 surge in the percentage of women registering to vote compared to men even exceeded the highest previous such imbalance which was recorded in the aftermath of the Dobbs decision in June of 2022. Young Black women led the way, with registration nearly tripling relative to the same point in 2020. Overall, Black women almost doubled their registration numbers from 2020; young Hispanic women registration increased by a 150%.\n\nThe same trends were evident in the data TargetSmart collected from those battleground states that have published their voter registration data so far. For example, in Pennsylvania, the proportion of new registrations from voters under 30 rose 59.6% compared to 2020. Black registration was up 110% overall\u2014262% among Black women. The proportionate rise in registration for Democrats was more than double the rate for Republicans.\n\nIn North Carolina, 43% of new registrants were under 30 compared to only a 20% rise in 2020. In the week after Harris became the presumptive nominee, the total number of registrants was almost 50% higher than it was during the same week in 2020 (17,178 to 12,426).\n\nThe greatest proportionate rise among young voters in any of the battleground states occurred in Nevada where the number of Hispanic women under 30 registering to vote was three times the number in 2020. Black female registration doubled according to that state\u2019s data.\n\nAlthough we can\u2019t say for sure what the partisan implications of this data are, these trends in voter registration seem to come from groups that have historically voted Democratic.\n\nAnother metric that seems to bear good news for the Democratic candidate is the amount of money each campaign has raised. The impact Harris\u2019 candidacy is having on the composition of the electorate, evidenced in the new voter registration data, was reflected in the campaign\u2019s August fundraising with 1.3 million of the nearly three million contributions coming from people making their first donation in 2024.\n\nIn August, the Harris campaign raised $361 million compared to Trump\u2019s $130 million, representing a decline from his $139 million July numbers. In just the day following the debate, the Harris campaign raised $47 million from nearly 600,000 individual donors. Since she became the nominee, her campaign has raised almost double the amount of money the Trump campaign has. Of that amount, 41.63% came from donations of less than $200 compared to Trump\u2019s smaller donor percentage of 31.71%.\n\nSo far, data from actual voter behavior such as voter registrations and campaign donations suggest that Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 campaign has been successful in motivating traditionally Democratic voters and increasing small donor money. If these trends continue, both nationally and in swing states, it could spell victory for her in November.",

                "description": "The United States takes action to defend and protect U.S. campaign and government officials from Iranian attempts to interfere in U.S. elections.WASHINGTON \u2014 Today, the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) designated\u00a0seven individuals as part of a coordinated U.S. government response to Iran\u2019s operations that sought to influence or interfere in the\u00a02024 and 2020 presidential elections. Iranian state-sponsored actors undertook a variety of malicious cyber activities, such as hack-and-leak operations and spear-phishing, in an attempt to undermine confidence in the United States\u2019 election processes and institutions and to interfere with political campaigns. The designations undertaken today pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13848, complement law enforcement actions taken by the Department of Justice against a variety of Iranian election interference actors.\u00a0\u201cThe U.S. government continues to closely monitor efforts by malicious actors to influence or interfere in the integrity of our elections,\u201d said Acting Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Bradley T. Smith. \u201cTreasury, as part of a whole-of-government effort leveraging all available tools and authorities, remains strongly committed to holding accountable those who see to undermine our institutions.\u201d\u00a0In the summer of\u00a02024,\u00a0the U.S. government identified that the Government of Iran had been seeking to stoke discord and undermine confidence in the United States\u2019 democratic institutions, using social engineering and other efforts to gain access to individuals with direct access to the presidential campaigns. Such activities, including thefts and disclosures, are intended to influence the U.S. election process. Since at least May\u00a02024, Iran-based hackers have increased their malicious cyber-enabled targeting of the\u00a02024 U.S. presidential election. These intrusions have been reported as the work of \u201cAPT\u00a042\u201d and \u201cMint Sandstorm\u201d by private security firms.Iranian Election Interference & Malicious Cyber-Enabled operations2024 U.S. Presidential Election InterferenceSince at least May\u00a02024, Masoud Jalili\u00a0(Jalili) and other Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) members compromised several accounts of officials and advisors to a\u00a02024 presidential campaign and leaked stolen data to members of the media and other persons for the purpose of influencing the\u00a02024 U.S. presidential election, using technical infrastructure known to be associated with Jalili. Jalili\u00a0is also responsible for malicious cyber operations targeting a former U.S. government official in\u00a02022. In 2022, Jalili used spear-phishing in an attempt to compromise the former U.S. official\u2019s personal accounts.\u00a0OFAC designated Jalili pursuant to E.O. 13848 for\u00a0being controlled by, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, the IRGC, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O.\u00a013848.\u00a0In addition to his designation, the Department of Justice has unsealed an indictment charging Jalili and two IRGC co-conspirators and the Department of State\u2019s Rewards for Justice program is offering a reward of up to\u00a0$10 million for information on Jalili and his two associates for their attempt to interfere in U.S. elections.2020 U.S. Presidential Election Interference\u00a0Today, OFAC is also designating six employees and executives of Emennet Pasargad,\u00a0an Iranian cybersecurity company formerly known as\u00a0Net Peygard Samavat Company, which attempted to interfere in the\u00a02020 U.S. presidential election.\u00a0Between approximately August and November\u00a02020, Emennet Pasargad led an online operation to intimidate and influence American voters, and to undermine voter confidence and sow discord, in connection with the\u00a02020 U.S. presidential election. Emennet Pasargad personnel obtained or attempted to obtain U.S. voter information from U.S. state election websites, sent threatening emails to intimidate voters, and crafted and disseminated disinformation pertaining to the election and election security. In November\u00a02021, OFAC\u00a0designated Emennet Pasargad pursuant to E.O. 13848 for attempting to influence the\u00a02020 U.S. presidential election, and five Emennet Pasargad associates pursuant to E.O.\u00a013848 for acting, or purporting to act, for or on behalf of Emennet Pasargad.In February\u00a02019, OFAC\u00a0designated Emennet Pasargad\u00a0pursuant to E.O.\u00a013606 for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Electronic Warfare and Cyber Defense Organization. Net Peygard Samavat Company was involved in a malicious cyber campaign to gain access to and implant malware on the computer systems of current and former U.S. counterintelligence agents. After being designated, Net Peygard Samavat Company rebranded itself as Emennet Pasargad, presumably to evade sanctions and continue its malicious cyber operations.DESIGNATION OF EMENNET PASARGAD EMPLOYEESAli Mahdavian, Fatemeh Sadeghi,\u00a0and Elaheh Yazdi\u00a0are employees of Emennet Pasargad and were named in a\u00a0November\u00a02023 U.S. Department of State\u00a0Rewards for Justice program. Sayyed Mehdi Rahimi Hajjiabadi, Mohammad Hosein Abdolrahimi,\u00a0and Rahmatollah Askarizadeh\u00a0are also employees of Emennet Pasargad.OFAC designated Ali Mahdavian, Fatemeh Sadeghi, Elaheh Yazdi, Sayyed Mehdi Rahimi Hajjiabadi, Mohammad Hosein Abdolrahimi, and Rahmatollah Askarizadeh pursuant to E.O\u00a013848 for being controlled by, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Emennet Pasargad, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O.\u00a013848.SANCTIONS IMPLICATIONSAs a result of today\u2019s action, all property and interests in property of the designated persons described above that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked and must be reported to OFAC. In addition, any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, individually or in the aggregate, 50 percent or more by one or more blocked persons are also blocked. Unless authorized by a general or specific license issued by OFAC, or exempt, OFAC\u2019s regulations generally prohibit all transactions by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in property of designated or otherwise blocked persons.\u00a0In addition, financial institutions and other persons that engage in certain transactions or activities with the sanctioned individuals may expose themselves to sanctions or be subject to an enforcement action. The prohibitions include the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any designated person, or the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.\u00a0The power and integrity of OFAC sanctions derive not only from OFAC\u2019s ability to designate and add persons to the SDN\u00a0List, but also from its willingness to remove persons from the SDN\u00a0List consistent with the law. The ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish, but to bring about a positive change in behavior. For information concerning the process for seeking removal from an OFAC\u00a0list, including the SDN\u00a0List, please refer to\u00a0OFAC\u2019s Frequently Asked Question 897 here.\u00a0For detailed information on the process to submit a request for removal from an OFAC sanctions list, please click here.Click here for more information on the individuals designated today.###",

In November 2021, OFAC designated Emennet Pasargad pursuant to E.O. 13848 for attempting to influence the 2020 U.S. presidential election, and five Emennet Pasargad associates pursuant to E.O. 13848 for acting, or purporting to act, for or on behalf of Emennet Pasargad.\n\nIn February 2019, OFAC designated Emennet Pasargad pursuant to E.O. 13606 for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Electronic Warfare and Cyber Defense Organization. Net Peygard Samavat Company was involved in a malicious cyber campaign to gain access to and implant malware on the computer systems of current and former U.S. counterintelligence agents. After being designated, Net Peygard Samavat Company rebranded itself as Emennet Pasargad, presumably to evade sanctions and continue its malicious cyber operations.\n\nDESIGNATION OF EMENNET PASARGAD EMPLOYEES\n\nAli Mahdavian, Fatemeh Sadeghi, and Elaheh Yazdi are employees of Emennet Pasargad and were named in a November 2023 U.S. Department of State Rewards for Justice program. Sayyed Mehdi Rahimi Hajjiabadi, Mohammad Hosein Abdolrahimi, and Rahmatollah Askarizadeh are also employees of Emennet Pasargad.\n\nOFAC designated Ali Mahdavian, Fatemeh Sadeghi, Elaheh Yazdi, Sayyed Mehdi Rahimi Hajjiabadi, Mohammad Hosein Abdolrahimi, and Rahmatollah Askarizadeh pursuant to E.O 13848 for being controlled by, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Emennet Pasargad, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 13848.\n\nSANCTIONS IMPLICATIONS\n\nAs a result of today\u2019s action, all property and interests in property of the designated persons described above that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked and must be reported to OFAC. In addition, any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, individually or in the aggregate, 50 percent or more by one or more blocked persons are also blocked. Unless authorized by a general or specific license issued by OFAC, or exempt, OFAC\u2019s regulations generally prohibit all transactions by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in property of designated or otherwise blocked persons.\n\nIn addition, financial institutions and other persons that engage in certain transactions or activities with the sanctioned individuals may expose themselves to sanctions or be subject to an enforcement action. The prohibitions include the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any designated person, or the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.\n\nThe power and integrity of OFAC sanctions derive not only from OFAC\u2019s ability to designate and add persons to the SDN List, but also from its willingness to remove persons from the SDN List consistent with the law. The ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish, but to bring about a positive change in behavior. For information concerning the process for seeking removal from an OFAC list, including the SDN List, please refer to OFAC\u2019s Frequently Asked Question 897 here. For detailed information on the process to submit a request for removal from an OFAC sanctions list, please click here.\n\nClick here for more information on the individuals designated today.\n\n###",

        "text": "Election 2024: Are Americans Ready for Another Close Presidential Election?\nThe United States looks headed for another extremely tight presidential election where a small number of votes could decide the winner. If that happens, will the result look more like 2016 or 2020?\n\nPolitico Nightly summarizes how tight things look with just over five weeks left until Election Day:\n\nOne of the best known forecasts, Nate Silver\u2019s Silver Bulletin, gives Vice President Kamala Harris a 53.2 percent chance of winning, compared to former President Donald Trump\u2019s 46.6 percent shot. The Economist has Harris at 57/100 and Trump at 43/100. The Hill/Decision Desk HQ projects Harris has a 55 percent chance of victory and Trump has a 45 percent shot. And 538 says that Harris wins 58 times out of 100 while Trump claims victory 42 times out of 100.\n\nThat the race looks to be a coinflip doesn\u2019t mean that it will be close. Things could break for either Harris or Trump, giving one of them a clear or even resounding victory. There is precedent. The 1980 race between Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan was close until the final weeks. Some polls in late October even showed Carter with a small lead. Reagan won running away.\n\nThe Water's Edge James M. Lindsay analyzes the politics shaping U.S. foreign policy and the sustainability of American power. 2-4 times weekly.

Moving just 77,000 votes in the right combination of states eight years ago would have made Hillary Clinton president. Despite that small margin and the fact that she received nearly 2.9 million more votes than Donald Trump, few people questioned the results.\n\nClinton\u2019s supporters accepted the bitter pill of her defeat for at least three reasons. One was that no one thought the votes had been miscounted, even in states where she narrowly lost. A second reason was that early and mail-in voting was comparatively small, so the initial vote counts on Election Night mirrored the final result. A third reason was that Clinton quickly conceded defeat, saying that \u201cDonald Trump is going to be our president. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead.\u201d\n\nNone of those conditions held in 2020. The race was even tighter. Moving just 42,000 votes in the right combination of states would have reelected Trump. The margins were so small in Arizona and Georgia that it was conceivable that a recount could have changed the outcome. The fact that Democrats were more likely to vote early, and that several critical states counted those votes last, created the false initial impression that Trump had built a commanding and perhaps invincible lead. Most important, though, Trump refused to concede. A political system that rested to an underappreciated degree on norms as much as law suddenly found itself in a new world in which the loser refused to act as expected.\n\nLooking ahead, if the results are close, a repeat of 2020 seems more likely than a repeat of 2016, especially, but not only, if Trump loses. The former president has repeatedly questioned whether votes will be counted fairly and accurately in 2024, sometimes suggesting that his loss alone would prove the election was \u201crigged.\u201d Trump\u2019s supporters agree with his attacks on the integrity of U.S. elections. Just 28 percent of Republicans but 84 percent of Democrats have faith in the accuracy of the vote. However, what happens on Election Day and the days thereafter could dramatically alter what Democrats think.\n\nThere is a lot to worry about. This year\u2019s vote could test the U.S. election infrastructure in ways not seen before. As every American who has stood in long lines to vote knows, most American towns and cities have not invested heavily in their election infrastructure. Why spend a lot of money on elections when most races produce clear winners and voters often yawn at who wins?\n\nThat changes when elections are razor close and passions about the results are enflamed. Election officials in battleground states report that poll workers and vote counters face heightened scrutiny, which in many instances has escalated into criminal harassment against them, their families, and friends, making it much harder to recruit and retain the unsung heroes who make American democracy possible. The U.S. deputy attorney general has warned of an \u201cunprecedented rise\u201d in threats against election workers. Some localities are responding by putting workers behind bulletproof glass and equipping them with panic buttons.\n\nAdd in the fact that many states have tightened the rules on voting that could cause confusion on Election Day, that both parties have invested heavily in legal teams to contest the vote, and that social media\u2014with the help of Russia, Iran, and other state actors\u2014will likely amplify misinformation and disinformation, and the potential for a chaotic and deeply divisive and possibly problematic vote count runs high. Hovering over all of this is the threat that political passions could spill over into violence.\n\nThat is not an outcome anyone wishes to see. But even if we avoid it, Election 2024 could deepen America\u2019s political divisions and make it harder for whoever wins to pick up the pieces and address the country\u2019s significant challenges.\n\nCampaign Update\n\nRetired U.S. Army General Stanley McChrystal, who led U.S. Special Forces from 2003 to 2008, endorsed Harris in a New York Times op-ed that posted last night. McChrystal, who was a visiting military fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in 1999-2000, based his endorsement on the relative characters of Harris and Trump. He argued that \u201cto turn a blind eye toward or make excuses for weak character from someone we propose to confer awesome power and responsibility on is to abrogate our role as citizens. We will get\u2014and deserve\u2014what we elect.\u201d He added that \u201cMs. Harris has the strength, the temperament and, importantly, the values to serve as commander in chief. When she sits down with world leaders like President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, representing the United States on the global stage, I have no doubt that she is working in our national interest, not her own.\u201d There is a lot going on there between the lines.\n\nThe recently revived Republican effort to move Nebraska back to a winner-take-all allocation of its Electoral College votes is once again dead. Republican state Senator Mike McDonnell announced on Monday that he opposed changing the state\u2019s allocation rule so close to Election Day. His decision meant that Republicans didn\u2019t have the thirty-three votes needed in the state legislature to overcome the filibuster that Nebraska Senate Democrats were guaranteed to launch. With Nebraska sticking with its rule of awarding one electoral vote to the winner of each of its three congressional districts, the prospect that Election 2024 could produce an Electoral College tie plummeted.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court last Friday rejected a request that it overrule a decision by Nevada\u2019s state Supreme Court to bar the Green Party from appearing on the state\u2019s ballot in November. The Nevada court held that even though the Green Party had relied on the language the Nevada Secretary of State\u2019s office provided, the language was incorrect and invalidated its ballot signature petitions. The U.S. Supreme Court did not explain its ruling. The court decisions were good news for Democrats, who worried that an appearance by Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein would divert votes from Harris in a critical battleground state.\n\nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court has agreed to hear Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s petition that his name be taken off the state\u2019s ballot. The court has pledged to render a decision as \u201cexpeditiously as possible.\u201d If that decision goes in Kennedy\u2019s favor, Wisconsin election officials will have a substantial logistical problem on their hands\u2014they have already sent out absentee ballots with Kennedy\u2019s name listed. Kennedy\u2019s lawyers are proposing that election officials cover up his name on some four million ballots. Not only would this be a Herculean and error-prone task, modified ballots could jam the machines used to count votes.\n\nWhile Kennedy is fighting to get off the ballot in the Badger State, he is fighting to get on it in the Empire State. He asked the U.S. Supreme Court this week to put his name on the New York state ballot after New York courts bumped him off it last month because he was not a resident of the state as he claimed. Kennedy\u2019s move seems intended to help Trump in the Empire State by possibly siphoning votes away from Harris. New York state has already begun printing its ballots.\n\nWhat the Candidates Are Saying\n\nTrump unloaded on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at a campaign event in Mint Hill, North Carolina on Wednesday. Trump blamed Zelensky for causing the war by not having \u201cgiven up a little bit\u201d of territory to appease Russian President Vladimir Putin. In Trump\u2019s view, \u201cThere was no deal that he could have made that wouldn\u2019t have been better than the situation you have right now. You have a country that has been obliterated.\u201d Trump also argued that Democrats are \u201cnot going to be satisfied until they send American kids to Ukraine, and that\u2019s what they\u2019re trying to do.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s anger looks to have been triggered by the fact that Zelensky visited a munitions factory in Pennsylvania with the state\u2019s Democratic Governor, Josh Shapiro, an appearance that Republicans denounced as an implicit and inappropriate campaign event for Harris. Trump told the North Carolina crowd that the \u201cpresident of Ukraine is in our country and he\u2019s making little nasty aspersions toward your favorite President, me.\u201d\n\nNot surprisingly, Harris took note of Trump\u2019s comments. She and Zelensky made short remarks yesterday after the two emerged from a meeting at the White House with Biden. She did not mention Trump by name, but made it clear that she thinks he is echoing Putin\u2019s talking points:\n\nZelensky wisely declined to respond to Trump\u2019s remarks.\n\nDespite his pique at Zelensky, Trump met the Ukrainian president this morning at Trump Tower in New York. The two men gave brief remarks to reporters before the meeting. Trump vowed to \u201cwork with both parties to\u201d end the war in Ukraine, saying that he had \u201ca very good relationship\u201d with both Zelensky and Putin.\n\nTrump again declined to provide specifics on how he would strike a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nTrump also used the North Carolina rally to accuse Iran of plotting to assassinate him and suggesting Tehran was behind the two recent attempts on his life. No evidence linking Iran to either attempt has surfaced publicly, and the available evidence suggests that neither attack was part of a broader plot. Officials from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence briefed Trump on Tuesday on the threats that Iran poses to him personally and to his campaign. In July, the FBI arrested a Pakistani man with ties to Iran for attempting to hire a hit man to assassinate American politicians. Neither intelligence officials nor law enforcement officials have said whether that plot targeted Trump or if evidence of a new plot against him has emerged. Trump told the crowd in North Carolina that \u201cif I were the president, I would inform the threatening country, in this case, Iran, that if you do anything to harm this person, we are going to blow your largest cities and the country itself to smithereens.\u201d\n\nAt a press conference on Monday in Smithton, Pennsylvania, Trump was asked about claims by economists that his proposed tariffs will raise prices. He responded by making the point I made in last week\u2019s post, namely, that he can raise tariffs without asking Congress for its blessing:\n\nTrump\u2019s claim that people who know business \u201csupport\u201d tariffs is true for those industries that stand to benefit from tariffs. But industries that depend on imports or are vulnerable to retaliatory tariffs feel differently.\n\nWhat the Pundits Are Saying\n\nBruce Stokes of the German Marshall Fund provided a short overview of where the American public stands on foreign policy on the eve of the election. One of the findings is that three-out-of-four Republicans say that the United States should be less involved in solving problems overseas. But the trend in that polling question is even more interesting. The percentage of Republicans saying that the United States should be solving problems overseas grew under Trump and fell under Biden. That suggests that Republicans are not necessarily turning inward, but they are only interested in being active abroad when a Republican sits in the Oval Office. Call it \u201ccontingent isolationism.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post mapped out eight possible routes by which Harris or Trump could win the presidency. The easiest path for Harris, based on current polling, is winning all the states that now lean Democratic and winning the battleground states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Conversely, all of Trump\u2019s paths to victory, based on current polling, require him to take at least one of the Rust Belt battleground states.\n\nP. Michael McKinley argued in Foreign Policy that former Trump administration officials are exaggerating his foreign policy successes and downplaying his failures. McKinley contends that Mike Pompeo, Robert O\u2019Brien, H.R. McMaster, and other Trump administration alumni are looking to \u201creassure a broader audience that a second Trump presidency would be more mainstream than many fear, and, by extension, to present his first administration as one of successes which restored American leadership on the international stage. Having served almost three years in the Trump administration as ambassador and senior adviser to the secretary of State, I can say that both contentions are wrong.\u201d\n\nDavid Sanger and Julian E. Barnes write in the New York Times that foreign interference in the U.S. election is likely to surge now that Election Day is less than six weeks away. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of their reporting is that China, Russia, and Iran, which all wish to see U.S. power diminished, have different, and to a degree, conflicting objectives with their interference campaigns: \u201cWhile the Russians make little attempt to hide their support for former President Donald J. Trump, the Iranians\u2026 desperately want to stop him from returning to office.\u201d China, however, \u201cseems uncertain which candidate it detests more. So, for now, Beijing is focusing on local races, conducting influence operations that have the potential to undermine public faith in the basic democratic process.\u201d\n\nI sat down with my colleagues Alice Hill and Varun Sivaram on The President\u2019s Inbox to discuss the climate challenge that the next president will face. One of the things we discussed is that the importance of climate change as an issue varies by age. As Varun noted, polling shows that \u201cvoters care way more about costs and inflation than they do about climate. By the way, the notable exception is among eighteen to twenty-nine-year-olds. The top foreign policy priority is climate change.\u201d Neither candidate, however, is stressing climate change on the campaign trail.\n\nWhat the Polls Show\n\nGallup reported this week that a review of \u201cnearly all Gallup measures that have shown some relationship to past presidential election outcomes or that speak to current perceptions of the two major parties favor the Republican Party over the Democratic Party. Chief among these are Republican advantages in U.S. adults\u2019 party identification and leanings, the belief that the GOP rather than the Democratic Party is better able to handle the most important problem facing the country, Americans\u2019 dissatisfaction with the state of the nation, and negative evaluations of the economy with a Democratic administration in office.\u201d\n\nThe Campaign Schedule\n\nThe vice-presidential debate is four days away (October 1, 2024).\n\nElection Day is thirty-nine days away (November 5, 2024).\n\nElectors will meet in each state and the District of Columbia to cast their votes for president and vice president in seventy-seven days (December 17, 2024).\n\nThe 119th U.S. Congress will be sworn into office in ninety-eight days (January 3, 2025).\n\nThe U.S. Congress will certify the results of the 2024 presidential election in 101 days (January 6, 2025).\n\nInauguration Day is 115 days away (January 20, 2025).\n\nOscar Berry assisted in the preparation of this post.",

        "text": "Trump meets Zelensky and says it's time to end Russia's war\nTrump meets Zelensky and says it's time to end Russia's war\n\nWatch: We'll work with both sides of war to get this settled, Trump says\n\nDonald Trump met Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky at his New York base in Trump Tower on Friday and said it was time Russia's war in Ukraine was settled. The Republican presidential nominee has repeatedly criticised the Ukrainian leader on the US campaign trail, and a meeting between the pair had seemed unlikely until hours before. As the two men stood side by side, Zelensky said he thought they had a \"common view that the war has to be stopped and Putin can't win\", adding that he would discuss with Trump details of his \"victory plan\". Despite years of differences, Trump insisted he had a very good relationship with Zelensky.\n\n\"I also have a very good relationship as you know with President Putin and I think if we win [the election] we\u2019re going to get it resolved very quickly,\" he said. Afterwards, Trump and Zelensky spoke to Fox News and the former president said he \u201clearned a lot\u201d from the meeting. \u201cWe both want to see this end, and we both want to see a fair deal made,\u201d he said. \u201cIt should stop and the president (Zelensky) wants it to stop, and I\u2019m sure President Putin wants it to stop and that\u2019s a good combination.\u201d Zelensky said: \u201cPutin killed so many people and of course we need to do everything to pressure him to stop this war. He\u2019s on our territory.\u201d Zelensky invited Trump to visit Ukraine, and Trump replied: \u201cI will\u201d. The Ukrainian president later posted on his Telegram channel that the pair had a \u201cvery meaningful meeting\u201d. \u201cWe have a common view that the war in Ukraine must be stopped. Putin cannot win. Ukrainians must win,\u201d he wrote. Trump, meanwhile, said on his Truth Social account that if he is not elected president, \"that war will never end, and will phase into WORLD WAR III\".\n\nThe pair have long had a tumultuous relationship. Trump was impeached in 2019 over accusations that he pressured Zelensky to dig up damaging information on the Biden family. A rough transcript of the call revealed Trump had urged Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden, as well as Biden's son Hunter. Standing beside Zelensky on Friday, he praised the Ukrainian leader's handling of the issue. Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Trump has frequently repeated Moscow's talking points about the war. During September's presidential debate, he sidestepped a question on whether he wanted Ukraine to emerge victorious in the conflict. Ahead of Friday's meeting, Trump repeated his long-standing claim that he would be able to \"work out something\" to settle the war if he won the presidential election, long before Joe Biden leaves office in January. He has refused to elaborate when asked whether he believes Ukraine should cede territory to Russia as a means of ending the war. Although Zelensky has been visiting the US since Sunday, their meeting was only confirmed on Thursday night, when Trump posted a screenshot of a text message from President Zelensky saying it was \"important for us to have a personal contact and to understand each other 100%\".\n\nReuters President Zelensky met Donald Trump at the end of a six-day visit to the US\n\nThere have been tensions all week between Zelensky and the Republican party ahead of November's US presidential election. Some Republicans were angered by Zelensky's visit to an arms factory in Biden's hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania, with top Democrats, including state Governor Josh Shapiro, earlier this week. Zelensky's trip to the key swing state was labelled by leading Republicans as a partisan campaign event. In a public letter, House Speaker Mike Johnson said the visit was \"designed to help Democrats\" and claimed it amounted to \"election interference\".\n\nRos Atkins on... Why the US election is crucial to Ukraine\n\nTrump has grown increasingly critical of continued US funding for Ukraine, and in recent days has sharpened his attacks against Zelensky, calling him the \"greatest salesman on Earth\" for continuing to obtain military aid. In contrast, Zelensky recently told the New Yorker magazine that he believes Trump \"doesn't really know how to stop the war\" and called Trump's running mate JD Vance \"too radical\" and \"dangerous\" for suggesting that Ukraine should give up territory to end the war, saying it would spark conflict around the world. When asked about Zelensky's comments on Thursday, Trump replied: \"I do believe I disagree with him. He doesn't know me.\"\n\nOdesa Regional Prosecutors\n\nOn Thursday, Zelensky met US President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris at the White House to discuss his \"victory plan\", which he hopes will pressure Russia into agreeing a diplomatic end to the war. Hours before, Biden had announced a further $7.9bn (\u00a35.9bn) package of military assistance to Ukraine. As Zelensky visited the US, drone attacks continued in Ukraine. On Thursday night, three people were killed and 14 others wounded in a Russian drone attack on Izmail, a port city on the River Danube. Russia has targeted Izmail\u2019s grain export facilities in the past. Prosecutors say two boys aged three and 13, and a girl aged 14, were among those wounded in the latest attack. Romania\u2019s defence ministry said it was possible that one of the Russian drones involved in the attack had crossed the border into Romania, a Nato member state, for a very short period.",

        "text": "U.S. charges 3 Iranian hackers who allegedly targeted Trump campaign\nFederal prosecutors have charged three Iranian hackers for allegedly targeting members of former President Donald Trump's presidential campaign as part of a \"wide-ranging\" malicious cyber scheme, according to a newly unsealed indictment.\n\nThe three defendants \u2014 identified in the indictment as Masoud Jalili, Seyyed Ali Aghamiri and Yasar Balaghi \u2014 are all members of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Prosecutors said they executed a \"wide-ranging hacking campaign that used spearphishing and social engineering techniques to target and compromise the accounts of current and former U.S. government officials, members of the media, nongovernmental organizations, and individuals associated with U.S. political campaigns.\"\n\nThe 37-page indictment, handed down by a grand jury in Washington, D.C., charges the men with 18 counts, including wire fraud, identity theft, conspiracy to provide material support to a terrorist organization and hacking conspiracy.\n\nThe charges mark an escalation in the federal government's work to combat Iran's alleged efforts to interfere in the 2024 presidential election. The State Department quickly offered a $10 million reward for information about the three defendants, and the Treasury Department unveiled new sanctions targeting seven people tied to the Iranian hacking effort.\n\nCharging documents do not name the campaign the defendants allegedly targeted, but U.S. officials have said consistently that Iran is seeking to undermine Trump's bid for the White House. Context included in the indictment makes clear that the Trump campaign was the target of the recent efforts.\n\n\"There are few actors in this world that pose as grave a threat to the national security of the United States as does Iran,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said Friday. \"The message of the U.S. government is clear: the American people, not a foreign power, decide the outcome of our country's election.\"\n\nThe hacking allegations\n\nAn FBI wanted poster shows the three defendants charged with targeting the Trump campaign on Friday, Sept. 27, 2024. FBI\n\nThe indictment laid out a sprawling cyber campaign in which the defendants sought to hack into American computers and steal data. The men worked to \"stoke discord, erode confidence in the U.S. electoral process\" and \"advance the malign activities of the IRGC,\" the indictment alleged.\n\nProsecutors said the hackers \u2014 all of whom reside in Iran \u2014 began their work as early as January 2020, after the U.S. killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike in Baghdad. The hackers allegedly turned their sights to Trump's political campaign in May of this year. Investigators said they gained access to people associated with the campaign via spearphishing emails and stole private documents and emails, which they then tried to leak to the media and \"individuals that the Conspirators believed were associated with\" another presidential campaign.\n\nThe indictment does not name the other presidential campaign, but its description matches that of President Biden before he dropped out of the race. Garland said Friday that both campaigns cooperated with the investigation and there is no indication anyone from the Biden campaign replied to the hackers' messages. Multiple news outlets have also reported receiving confidential Trump campaign material that appeared to have been stolen.\n\nA Harris-Walz campaign official told CBS News \"the materials were not used.\"\n\nMorgan Finklestein, a national security spokesperson for Harris' election bid, said in a statement that the campaign cooperated with the investigation.\n\n\"We're not aware of any material being sent directly to the campaign; a few individuals were targeted on their personal emails with what looked like a spam or phishing attempt,\" Fiknlestein said. \"We condemn in the strongest terms any effort by foreign actors to interfere in U.S. elections including this unwelcome and unacceptable malicious activity. Broadly, we have robust cybersecurity measures in place, and personnel are trained to be vigilant against potentially malicious content.\"\n\nDescribed in the indictment as skilled computer hackers with years of experience, the defendants worked for a paramilitary branch of Iran's IRGC known as the Basij. Prosecutors said they launched a years-long campaign to target the email accounts of current and former government officials, including those who worked for the White House, Justice Department, Pentagon and CIA.\n\nThe indictment detailed the advanced methods the hackers allegedly used to target their American victims, including the deployment of static IP addresses, the creation of spoof login pages and the use of stolen multi-factor authentication codes to get access to information. In many cases, according to charging documents, the hackers used Iranian infrastructure to create fake U.S. email accounts to communicate with their victims and gain access to their files.\n\n\"After establishing their unauthorized access \u2026 the [defendants] made efforts to conceal their presence to maintain long-term, persistent access,\" investigators wrote. They \"stole data and campaign material from the victim accounts \u2026 and, in some instances, later distributed stolen campaign materials.\"\n\nOn May 23, 2024, the Iranian hackers were said to have targeted Trump's campaign. By June, they had allegedly gained access to the email accounts of at least two unnamed individuals associated with the campaign. Later that month, on June 27, the defendants sent a message to the personal account of an individual they believed to be associated with the Biden campaign.\n\n\"I'm the one who has access to [Trump's campaign], but I hate [Trump] and strongly don't want to see his second term,\" the hackers allegedly wrote. \"I'm going to pass some materials to you that would be useful to defeat him.\"\n\nInvestigators said the recipient of the email did not reply to the message. According to the indictment, other alleged attempts to contact the Biden campaign also went unanswered.\n\nEarlier this summer, on July 22, the Iranian hackers shifted their focus to members of the media in an attempt to deploy stolen campaign material about \"potential vice presidential candidates.\" According to prosecutors, the alleged conduct continued into the following month.\n\nIn a statement released Friday, FBI Director Christopher Wray characterized the activities as \"attempts by a hostile foreign government to steal campaign information from one presidential candidate, and shop it around to that candidate's opponent and the media.\"\n\nIran and the 2024 election\n\nThe FBI launched investigations earlier this summer after people associated with the Trump and Biden campaigns were the targets of attempted phishing schemes, sources told CBS News in August.\n\nLast week, federal officials with the FBI and other intelligence agencies released a statement confirming that \"Iranian malicious cyber actors in late June and early July sent unsolicited emails to individuals then associated with President Biden's campaign that contained an excerpt taken from stolen, non-public material from former President Trump's campaign as text in the emails.\"\n\nThe statement went on to say that \"Iranian malicious cyber actors have continued their efforts since June to send stolen, non-public material associated with former President Trump's campaign to U.S. media organizations. \u2026 Foreign actors are increasing their election influence activities as we approach November.\"\n\nIran's United Nations mission previously denied it was interfering or launching cyberattacks in the U.S. presidential election, telling CBS News in a statement last week that \"the Islamic Republic of Iran does not engage in the internal uproars or electoral controversies of the United States.\" The statement added that Iran \"neither has any motive nor intent to interfere in the U.S. election; and, it therefore categorically repudiates such accusations.\"\n\nTrump's campaign revealed last month that it had been hacked and said Iranian actors were involved in stealing and distributing sensitive internal documents to members of the press.\n\nFBI agents worked with both Google and Microsoft to dig into the apparent spearphishing attacks targeting those close to both presidential campaigns, according to two people familiar with the probe. A report published by Microsoft earlier this summer revealed Iran is evolving its tactics to affect the upcoming election.\n\nTrump and former members of his administration have been targets of Iranian actors following the killing of Soleimani in 2020. Some former officials were given increased protection due to threats against their lives, and in July, federal prosecutors filed charges against a Pakistani national with ties to Iran for allegedly planning to assassinate American politicians, including possibly Trump.\n\nIran is not the only foreign adversary that U.S. officials say is seeking to undermine the upcoming presidential election. Intelligence agencies have warned Russia and China have launched cyber campaigns of their own to sow chaos, with Russia allegedly seeking to damage Vice President Kamala Harris' bid for the White House.\n\nSpeaking at an event hosted by the Atlantic Council on Thursday, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said the U.S. is \"seeing more threat actors getting into the game\" of election interference, fueled by advancements in artificial intelligence.\n\nThe goal, according to Monaco, is to \"sow discord, sow distrust in our election system and undermine confidence in our democratic process.\"\n\n, and contributed to this report.",

        "text": "US Elections 2024: How religious beliefs are changing in the US and how it will impact the election\nAmerica is one of the most religious countries in the West. About two-thirds of its voters identify as Christian.\n\nBut - things are changing and the nation has become less devout in the last few decades.\n\nSo how will this affect the polls in the 2024 presidential elections?\n\nHow religious is America?\n\nWe may think that faith communities are strong in the US - but religion is actually declining.\n\nIn the 1990s around 90% of Americans identified as Christian. Now more than a quarter say they have no religion.\n\nThis is significant to the election because 70% of non-religious voters in America are more likely to vote Democrat, according to a Pew Research Survey from April this year. The alignment is even stronger for agnostics (78%) and atheists (84%).\n\nImage: Among non-religious voters in the US, the Democratic Party has a significant edge\n\nBut religion is not fading across the whole of America. In some states, like Oklahoma, Arkansas, Mississippi, Louisiana and Alabama - essentially the Bible belt of America - it's actually getting stronger.\n\nAnd American Christians, including Protestants and Catholics, are generally more likely to align themselves with the Republican Party.\n\nImage: Republicans tend to be popular among Catholic voters, with the exception being Hispanic Catholics\n\nImage: The Republican Party tends to be more popular among Protestant voters in the US, with some exceptions\n\nBut race plays a significant part - 84% of Black protestants and 60% of Hispanic Catholics are more likely to vote for the Democrats.\n\nSo while they're making gains in some less religious states, they're also losing voters in other more conservative parts of the country.\n\nThis is key when looking at the swing states.\n\nReligion and the swing states\n\nIn the 2020 US election, seven US states were won by less than three percentage points - a very tight margin that could change this year.\n\nThese states were: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, North Carolina and Nevada.\n\nThese were mostly won by Joe Biden in 2020 - apart from North Carolina, which Donald Trump won.\n\nImage: Swing states at the 2020 US presidential election\n\nHowever, in the 2016 election, Mr Trump won all of these states - apart from Nevada.\n\nImage: Swing states in the 2016 US presidential election\n\nSo which way are they likely to swing now?\n\nIf we look at changes from the 2010 to the 2020 Census, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Georgia are trending less religious. While North Carolina, Nevada, and Arizona became more religious.\n\nImage: If US swing states vote along the lines of religious trends, they will still be divided almost evenly between the Democrats and Republicans\n\nIf we go with the rough trend that less religious states are more likely to vote for the Democrats and more religious states are more likely to vote for the Republicans, this gives the Democrats the edge in four of the seven swing states - with Republicans winning only three.\n\nBut as you can see from the split - not to mention the other factors at play - it's a really tight battle for the swing states, and therefore the White House.\n\nWhat about abortion?\n\nIn June 2022 the US Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion, known as the Roe v Wade ruling, leaving the decision to individual states.\n\nAs a result, 14 of the 50 US states banned abortion at all stages of pregnancy with very limited exceptions. Four have banned it past roughly six weeks of pregnancy.\n\nImage: How abortion bans have been applied in US states\n\nUnderpinning the ban is the belief among some religious people that human life begins at conception and that unborn children have a right to life.\n\nWhile the new ruling was celebrated by many Republicans and Christian conservatives who wanted to ban abortion nationwide, opinion polls show that the majority of Americans actually support abortion access.\n\nDemocratic nominee Kamala Harris has come out in strong support of abortion rights across the country.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:35 Harris calls out Trump over abortion 'lies'\n\nWhile Republican nominee Mr Trump appointed three of the six US Supreme Court justices who helped overturn Roe v Wade back in 2022, he is softening his stance on harsh abortion bans - perhaps because of that polling.\n\nIn August, he told an NBC reporter that he thought Florida's six-week abortion ban was \"too short\", adding: \"I believe in exceptions for life of the mother, incest, rape.\"\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 4:20 Trump says abortion up to states\n\nIsrael and Gaza policy\n\nAmerican evangelicals have solidly supported Israel's response to the Hamas attack since 7 October last year.\n\nThis is partly because of the Bible. In 2017, a LifeWay poll found that 80% of US evangelical Christians believe that the creation of Israel in 1948 was a fulfilment of the biblical prophecy.\n\nThat's despite the fact the US public is pretty divided on Israel's conduct in the war.\n\nAnd in Michigan, a swing state where there is a large Arab American population, some American Muslims are particularly disappointed with the current administration's stance on the war.\n\nBoth Ms Harris and Mr Trump have stated their ongoing support for Israel in this war. Ms Harris has pledged she'll push for a ceasefire deal, while Mr Trump says he urged Benjamin Netanyahu to \"stop the killing\" - in his words.\n\nRead more:\n\nHarris takes aim at Putin alongside Zelenskyy\n\nMan charged with trying to assassinate Trump\n\nFollow Sky News on WhatsApp Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky News Tap here\n\nDoes the candidate's religion matter?\n\nBoth Ms Harris and Mr Trump identify as religious.\n\nImage: Kamala Harris during the 2020 election campaign at a church in Michigan. Pic: AP\n\nMs Harris is a Baptist with a religiously diverse family. Her father is a Jamaican-born Christian Baptist, her mother an Indian-born Hindu and her husband is Jewish.\n\nMr Trump, on the other hand, was confirmed at a Presbyterian church as a child, though in 2020 he told the Religious News Service that he now considers himself a non-denominational Christian.\n\nHis courting of the evangelical vote perhaps explains why he's distanced himself from his Calvinist upbringing.\n\nImage: Donald Trump is seeking a second term. Pic: Reuters\n\nNearly all US adults say they want a president who lives a moral and ethical life, and almost half say it's important for the president to have strong religious beliefs, according to a 2024 Pew Research Survey.\n\nSo it's clear morality and ethics - if not religion - are seen as strong requirements for US presidential candidates.\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free\n\nYet despite calling himself a Christian, recent surveys show that a majority of Americans think Mr Trump is not very - or at all - religious.\n\nBut this - and his recent criminal conviction over hush money payments to a porn actress - doesn't appear to have put off more conservative religious Americans from backing him.",

        "text": "How do U.S. elections affect stock market performance?\nThe 2024 presidential race, once anticipated as a showdown between Democratic President Joe Biden and former Republican President Donald Trump, has taken some unexpected turns. With Biden's surprise withdrawal and endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee, the political landscape has shifted. While no two elections are exactly the same, history shows election outcomes have less influence on long-term market performance than investors may think.\n\nMany investors can feel jittery in election years, concerned how election results might sway their investment portfolios. Some even consider hitting the pause button on investing altogether to avoid uncertainty. Taking a closer look, history shows markets don\u2019t pick political favourites, and over the long-term have performed well under both Democratic and Republican leadership (Figure 1A). And despite changes in governing parties and various political events, markets have maintained their long-term upward trajectory, demonstrating resilience to short-term political shifts (Figure 1B) .\n\nSource: Bloomberg, November 8, 2016 to September 1, 2024. The S&P 500 returns during Donald Trump's presidency, lasting 1,455 days, are measured from November 9, 2016, to November 3, 2020. In contrast, the returns for Joe Biden's presidency, covering 1,397 days, are tracked from November 4, 2020, to September 1, 2024. Returns for the period leading up to the election date of November 5, 2024, are not included. For illustrative purposes only. Indices are not managed, and it is not possible to invest directly in an index. Assumes reinvestment of all income and no transaction costs, fees, or taxes.\n\nDespite facing many different challenges during their times in power, market results for Trump and Biden have been almost identical\n\nSource: Bloomberg. This chart illustrates growth of $1,000 invested in the S&P 500 from September 1, 1974, to September 1, 2024. For illustrative purposes only. Indices are not managed, and it is not possible to invest directly in an index. Assumes reinvestment of all income and no transaction costs, fees, or taxes. Compound growth calculations are used only for the purpose of illustrating the effects of compound growth and are not intended to reflect future values of any mutual fund or returns on investment in any mutual fund.\n\nOver the past 50 years, $1,000 invested in the S&P 500 would have grown more than $230,000, demonstrating the market's resilience through numerous political changes. This remarkable growth occurred despite multiple transitions between Republican and Democratic administrations, and various economic policies.\n\nWhile elections can influence fiscal policy and, by extension, financial markets, the broader economy plays a much more significant role in steering market direction. As election day approaches, Canada and the U.S. are showing signs of economic strength:\n\nPositioning an investment portfolio based on an expected election outcome is rife with uncertainty. Not only is it challenging to correctly guess who'll be the election winner, it\u2019s even more difficult to gauge the resulting winning investments.\n\nNot only did Trump win the election, but the S&P 500 index rallied nearly 30% in the 12 months that followed.\n\nDuring the 2016 election, most experts were convinced that democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton would win. Experts also predicted that in the unlikely event of a Trump win, markets would collapse.\n\nBoth of these leading predictions proved to be wrong. And investors who avoided investing in the stock market based on these forecasts missed out on significant gains, underscoring the costly consequences of market timing based on political speculation.\n\nHistorically, U.S. elections have caused short-term market volatility but had minimal long-term impact. Policy shifts between parties are typically minor, rarely affecting companies' growth rates or long-term profitability. As long-term investors, we don't alter investments based on speculated political outcomes or anticipated policy changes. While responding to change is important, speculating on binary outcomes is not a secure strategy.\n\nWhile political headlines may trigger short-term market fluctuations, the long-term performance of stocks is primarily driven by their fundamentals. Over the past 75 years, 18 presidential elections have occurred, with U.S. stocks showing positive performance in 16 of those years (89%).\n\nDuring U.S. election years, it's typical for the VIX Index, a measure of stock market volatility, to show an uptick in the months leading up to the election day. While volatility can increase as election day approaches, it has historically subsided immediately afterward - underscoring the importance of maintaining a long-term perspective, rather than acting on short-term political noise when making investment decisions.\n\nWith markets thriving under various political administrations and typically overcoming short-term volatility caused by presidential elections, investors should resist the urge to time the market based on political outcomes. Instead, investors are better served by maintaining focus on their long-term financial goals and staying committed to their investment strategy throughout election cycles.",

        "text": "LDP presidential election in Japan to be decided on September 27\nNine contenders are vying for leadership of Japan's main ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Vote counting will take place on September 27. The winner is expected to become the country's next Prime Minister. The policies and profiles of each candidate are highlighted here.\n\nCandidates' backgrounds\n\nTakaichi Sanae, 63, is Japan's Economic Security Minister. She has been elected nine times. This is the second time for her to run in the party's presidential election, following the previous election three years ago.\n\nShe has cited former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher as an inspiration. Her hobbies include music, motorcycles and watching dramas.\n\nTakaichi said the first thing that must be done is to transform the LDP into a party the people can truly trust. She added she wants to strengthen the party and create an environment where the LDP can continue to win elections at both the national and local levels.\n\nKobayashi Takayuki, 49, is a former Economic Security Minister. He was tapped in 2021 for Economic Security Minister as a member of the Kishida Fumio cabinet. Kobayashi will be running for the party presidential race for the first time.\n\nHis hobby is marathon running, and his best time is 3 hours and 50 minutes.\n\nKobayashi said he will create a national strategy for 2050 to ensure people can have hopes and dreams. He stressed he will make Japan an independent country that is not affected by the activities of other nations.\n\nHayashi Yoshimasa, 63, is currently serving as Chief Cabinet Secretary. This is the second time for him to run in the party's presidential election since 2012. He served as Foreign Minister in the Kishida Cabinet until September last year. He made efforts to hold the G7 Hiroshima Summit and respond to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nHayashi began playing in a band when he was a student. He is known as one of the best musicians in politics. He can sing as well as play guitar and piano.\n\nHayashi said he has carefully and diligently carried out his duties. He says he decided to run to make the best use of his experiences and achievements for Japan, which he loves more than anything else, as well as for his party.\n\nKoizumi Shinjiro, 43, has been elected five times. He was chosen as Environment Minister under the Abe Cabinet in 2019 and joined the Cabinet for the first time at the age of 38, the third youngest member since the end of World War Two. This is his first challenge in the party's presidential election.\n\nThe person he respects most is John F. Kennedy, who became US President at the age of 43, the same as Koizumi's current age.\n\nKoizumi said if he becomes Prime Minister, within one year he would carry out three major reforms: political reform, regulatory reform and expanding people's choices. He also expressed his intention to dissolve the Lower House as early as possible.\n\nKamikawa Yoko, 71, currently serves as Foreign Minister. This is the first time for her to run in a LDP leadership election. She studied at Harvard University Graduate School and obtained a master of political administration. She has served as a policy planning staff member for a US Senator. At a ministerial meeting of the Tokyo International Conference on African Development held in August, she performed the Bon dance in front of African ministers at a welcome reception.\n\nKamikawa said if she becomes Prime Minister, she will create a new Japan together with the public, without shying away from the challenges. She says she's determined to strengthen the economy and expand opportunities.\n\nThis is the first time for Kato Katsunobu, 68, to run for the LDP leadership position. In addition to Chief Cabinet Secretary, he has served as Health, Labor and Welfare Minister three times, during which he played a central role in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhen he was serving as Chief Cabinet Secretary, he was asked at a news conference whether he knew that the nickname \"tawashi,\" which is the Japanese word for a scrubbing brush, was given to him on the internet because of his straight hair. He replied that as the tawashi is used for polishing, he aimed to improve himself.\n\nHe said now is the time to double people's incomes, accelerate reforms and create a new Japan together. He stressed his determination to realize these outcomes, and that is his mission.\n\nJapan's Digital Transformation Minister Kono Taro, 61, is serving his ninth term as a Lower House lawmaker. This is the third time for him to run in the party's presidential election.\n\nHe studied at Georgetown University. He is fluent in English and studied the process of drawing up foreign policies.\n\nKono emphasized no country can maintain peace or regional stability on its own. He stressed now is the time to share this understanding with the public and communicate Japan's role and responsibilities to the world.\n\nIshiba Shigeru, 67, is making his fifth run in a party presidential election. He joined the Cabinet for the first time in 2002 as the head of the Defense Agency and served as Defense Minister and Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister.\n\nHe is known to be well-versed in national security policies. He is also known as a defense otaku because he likes to build plastic models of fighter jets and military vessels.\n\nIshiba said he will create a country that can protect the public, with natural disasters and security in mind. He added he will do his best to thoroughly explain his decisions to resolve people's distrust of politics.\n\nMotegi Toshimitsu, 68, is taking part for the first time in an LDP presidential election. He has served as economy, Trade and Industry Minister, Economic Revitalization Minister and Foreign Minister.\n\nHe is said to have an astonishing memory, and has an anecdote that he was late for the University of Tokyo's entrance exam but he passed it anyway.\n\nHe said he wants to draw out the capabilities of each citizen and the attractiveness of each region of Japan. He added he wants to work with the people to make Japan a country where everyone can live 100 years with a sense of security and hope for the future.\n\nCandidates pitch policies in Okinawa\n\nUS Marine Corps Futenma Air Station\n\nThe candidates addressed issues, such as Okinawa's burden of hosting US bases, in Naha City on Tuesday. About 70 percent of US military facilities in Japan are concentrated in Okinawa.\n\nChief Cabinet Secretary Hayashi Yoshimasa said the land taken up by the US Marine Corps Futenma Air Station should be returned as soon as possible.\n\nHe said he intends to successfully complete what the Cabinets of Abe Shinzo, Suga Yoshihide and Kishida Fumio worked hard to achieve.\n\nHe added that if he becomes Prime Minister he will accelerate efforts to realize the long-awaited wishes of the people of Okinawa.\n\nForeign Minister Kamikawa Yoko said she has worked harder than anyone else on the issue of sex crimes and sexual violence and has listened to the voices of the victims.\n\nShe stressed she will engage in negotiations with US military authorities to prevent such incidents involving American troops stationed in Okinawa from happening again.\n\nFormer LDP Secretary-General Ishiba Shigeru said he would start the review of the Japan-US Status of Forces Agreement. He said although he is well aware of how difficult the task is, the agreement needs more than improvements in the way it is applied.\n\nHe went on to say that US bases in Japan should be jointly managed by Japan's Self-Defense Forces and the US military. He said this means the government taking greater responsibility for Japan, but it should do so as a sovereign nation.\n\nThe current Secretary-General Motegi Toshimitsu said he wants to hold talks on the base issue as soon as a new US President is decided.\n\nHe said he will proceed with the return of US military facilities and areas one by one, and will promote the use of the returned sites.\n\nMotegi described the issue as complex, but said former President Donald Trump called him a \"tough negotiator,\" and he is confident he can follow through.\n\nCandidates also touched on bolstering Japan's defense capabilities in its southwestern islands, including responses to China's increasing maritime activity around the Senkaku Islands in Okinawa Prefecture.\n\nJapan controls the islands. The Japanese government maintains the islands are an inherent part of Japan's territory. China and Taiwan claim them.\n\nDigital Transformation Minister Kono Taro said China's People's Liberation Army has built up its strength to the same level as the US military, and that the Chinese Coast Guard is operating around the Senkakus on an almost daily basis.\n\nHe said thorough discussions are needed on how Japan's Self Defense Forces and the US military can defend the nation, Okinawa and the Senkaku Islands.\n\nRegarding measures for promoting industries in Okinawa, Economic Security Minister Takaichi Sanae said she has worked on initiatives to help the IT industry take root in Okinawa.\n\nShe said the prefecture is strong in IT and tourism, and many sectors are developing well. Takaichi stressed she wants to boost Okinawa's economy, and make all of Japan strong and affluent.\n\nFormer Economic Security Minister Kobayashi Takayuki said if he becomes Prime Minister he will closely work with Okinawa Prefecture and municipalities to create an industry cluster and job opportunities.\n\nHe suggested promoting the aerospace industry, data industry and smart farming in Okinawa. He added that the central government would make a bold regional investment under his leadership.\n\nFormer Environment Minister Koizumi Shinjiro said he will revitalize Okinawa by creating new industries. He said he will set up an educational institution to train specialists so that workers in the tourism and service industries will be able to earn higher incomes.\n\nHe highlighted the need to develop \"two-way\" industries that are not solely dependent on tourism and will pay the next generation well.\n\nFormer Chief Cabinet Secretary Kato Katsunobu said he will strive to double the incomes of the people in Okinawa. He noted Okinawa's economy has a high degree of dependence on central government spending.\n\nHe said he will increase Okinawa-related budgets to provide leverage for expanding the regional economy and raising the incomes of local people.\n\nHow the LDP leadership election process works\n\nA total of 736 votes are up for grabs. Lawmakers get a total of 368 ballots. An equal number of votes are decided on by rank-and-file members across the country.\n\nThe number of rank-and-file members stand at more than 1 million. Their ballots will first be counted by the LDP\u2019s prefectural chapters. The party headquarters will calculate the vote totals, and it will be distributed to candidates.\n\nWhoever receives a majority of combined votes from lawmakers and rank-and-file members, will win the party leadership.\n\nIf no one wins a majority, the winner will be decided by a runoff between the two top candidates.\n\nThe 415 votes in the runoff consists of 368 allotted to lawmakers and 47 given to each prefectural chapter. The candidate who receives the most votes will win the election.",

        "text": "U.S. government unveils charges against Iranians who hacked into Trump 2024 campaign \u2022 Missouri Independent\nWASHINGTON \u2014 U.S. law enforcement on Friday announced charges against three Iranians who allegedly stole materials from former President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign and tried to pass them to news media and Democrats in an attempt to influence the 2024 election.\n\nThe Department of Justice unsealed the indictment detailing a yearslong hacking scheme by Iran that targeted the email accounts of U.S. government officials, journalists, think tank experts, and most recently the 2024 presidential campaigns.\n\n\u201cThe defendants\u2019 own words make clear that they were attempting to undermine former President Trump\u2019s campaign in advance of the 2024 U.S. presidential election,\u201d Attorney General Merrick Garland said at a Friday press conference. Prosecutors believe the defendants acted from Iran and were never in the U.S.\n\n\u201cWe know that Iran is continuing its brazen efforts to stoke discord, erode confidence in the U.S. electoral process and advance its malign activities for the (Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps), a designated foreign terrorist organization,\u201d Garland said.\n\nThe unsealed indictment in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia came three days after Trump\u2019s campaign revealed the former president was briefed by the U.S. intelligence officials about \u201creal and specific threats from Iran to assassinate him,\u201d according to a statement Tuesday from Steven Cheung, the campaign\u2019s communications director.\n\n\u201cBig threats on my life by Iran,\u201d Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, posted on X Wednesday. Trump suggested at a campaign stop in Mint Hill, North Carolina, that Iran could be responsible for two assassination attempts on him.\n\nThe U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence has not published a statement on the matter. Its most recent press release focuses on the Iranian plot to hack Trump\u2019s campaign.\n\n\u2018It takes two to tango\u2019\n\nGlobal politics continued to top the U.S. presidential election headlines Friday when Trump welcomed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to Trump Tower after announcing the invitation late Thursday at a meandering press conference where he promised, if elected, to strike a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia \u201cquite quickly.\u201d\n\nThe pair met behind closed doors in Trump\u2019s New York City skyscraper on the sidelines of this week\u2019s United Nations General Assembly, and one day after Zelenskyy traveled to Washington to meet with Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, President Joe Biden and bipartisan lawmakers.\n\n\u201cAfter November we have to decide, and we hope that the strengths of the United States will be very strong, and we count on it. That\u2019s why I decided to meet with both candidates,\u201d Zelenskyy said during brief joint comments alongside Trump ahead of the meeting.\n\nTrump, who refused during a live presidential debate to say whether he wanted Ukraine to win its war with Russia, detoured from that stance and hinted Friday that he wants a victory for the Western ally.\n\n\u201cI think the fact that we\u2019re even together today is a very good sign, and hopefully we\u2019ll have a good victory, because (if) the other side wins, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re gonna have victories with anything to be honest with you,\u201d Trump said during the joint remarks.\n\nDuring the exchange, Trump highlighted his \u201cvery good relationship\u201d with Putin and said he could settle the war \u201cvery quickly.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you know, it takes two to tango,\u201d he said.\n\nHarris at the border\n\nHarris traveled to the U.S. southern border Friday to stump for a bipartisan border security deal that collapsed in early 2024 shortly after Trump publicly lambasted it.\n\nHarris was scheduled to deliver what her campaign billed as a major speech in the border town of Douglas, Arizona, where she planned to talk about setting and enforcing new immigration rules at the border, according to a senior campaign official.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump cares more about self-interest than solutions. He wants a problem to run on, not a fix for the American people,\u201d Harris campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa said in a statement Friday.\n\n\u201cWhen he was president, Trump created chaos at the border, taking our already broken immigration system and making it worse \u2013 leaving behind a mess for the Biden-Harris administration to clean up. Americans deserve a president who puts national security over their own self-interest \u2013 that\u2019s Kamala Harris,\u201d the statement continued.\n\nTrump is attacking Harris over border crossings into the U.S. \u2014 his central campaign issue \u2014 and calling her by the dishonest nickname \u201cborder czar\u201d and claiming she caused the \u201cworst border crisis in the history of the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the four years that have taken place after being named \u2018border czar,\u2019 Kamala Harris will be visiting the southern border that she has completely destroyed,\u201d Trump said at his Thursday press conference.\n\nBiden, in February 2021, tasked Harris with strategizing ways to fight the \u201croot cause\u201d of migration from Central American countries, including economic insecurity, government corruption and gender-based violence.\n\nTrump has historically painted with a broad brush the complex issue of immigration at the U.S. southern border, announcing his first presidential campaign in 2015 by describing Mexican immigrants as \u201crapists.\u201d During his own presidency in 2018 he warned of immigrant \u201ccaravans\u201d crossing into the U.S. from Mexico. He has promised mass deportations if elected in November.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security publicly releases numbers of border encounters, apprehensions and expulsions.\n\nBack on the trail\n\nThe presidential and vice presidential candidates are scheduled to make the following appearances:",

        "text": "US election 2020: Do postal ballots lead to voting fraud?\nUS election 2020: Do postal ballots lead to voting fraud?\n\nReuters\n\nPresident Trump has criticised the expansion of postal voting in the presidential election, claiming it leads to widespread fraud - but what evidence is there?\n\nThe US is in uncharted territory during the coronavirus pandemic with a record number of Americans having voted by post.\n\nElection authorities and the postal service have been put under immense strain processing the millions of extra ballots.\n\nThis has led to claims the system is unsafe and susceptible to manipulation.\n\nProblems at previous elections?\n\nNumerous national and state-level studies have shown that although there have been isolated cases, electoral fraud is very rare.\n\nThere have been a few, well-publicised cases, such as in the 2018 North Carolina primary, which was re-run after a consultant for the Republican candidate tampered with voting papers.\n\nBut the rate of voting fraud overall in the US is less than 0.0009%, according to a 2017 study by the Brennan Center for Justice.\n\nAnd Federal Election Commission head Ellen Weintraub has said: \"There's simply no basis for the conspiracy theory that voting by mail causes fraud.\"\n\nGetty Images\n\nLet's look at some specific examples where fraud has been claimed this year.\n\nVirginia\n\nSpeaking at a rally in mid-October, Donald Trump said: \"In Virginia, 500,000 applications were made that were false.\"\n\nAnd these applications, to apply for an absentee ballot form, were sent out with the wrong return address.\n\nBut the electoral authorities in Virginia say there was no fraudulent intent and the mistake has been corrected.\n\nThe Virginia Center for Voter Information (CVI) said: \"We worked for weeks to make sure that no Virginia voter was inconvenienced as a result of our printing error.\"\n\nReuters\n\nOhio\n\nPresident Trump tweeted: \"In Ohio, 50,000 ballots were wrong, fraudulent - 50,000.\"\n\nAbout 50,000 voters did receive the wrong ballot in the post, in Franklin County, Ohio, in early October.\n\nBut there is no evidence this was done fraudulently.\n\nAnd the local elections board said everyone affected was sent the correct voter slip, with safeguards in place to ensure no-one voted twice.\n\nThe board said the ballot error had been a \"serious mistake\".\n\nBut in response to the president's tweet, it added: \"Our board is bipartisan and our elections are fair - and every vote will be counted.\"\n\nIn New York, nearly 100,000 ballots were resent to voters after some names and addresses were printed incorrectly.\n\nIn Michigan about 400 postal ballots listed the wrong running mate for President Trump - the Libertarian Party's Jeremy Cohen instead of Mike Pence. President Trump claimed in September this had been deliberate. But the Michigan secretary of state said it had been an error and \"impacted voters immediately received an accurate ballot and guidance to ensure their vote counts\".\n\nAllow Twitter content?

How this happened remains unclear, despite investigation. The White House alleged fraud.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, nine discarded military ballots were discovered. Seven of them, according to the US Department for Justice, \"were cast for presidential candidate Donald Trump\".\n\nIn New Jersey, a mail carrier was charged after dumping hundreds of items of post in a dumpster, including almost 100 election ballots. Once found, the mail was sent on to its intended recipients.\n\nBut these were all isolated incidents.\n\nAnd there remains overwhelming evidence that voting by post is safe and secure.\n\nCould postal voting upend the US election?\n\nThere are provisions in place to prevent people from impersonating voters or stealing ballots - such as authorities checking that ballots have come from voters' registered address and requiring signatures on envelopes.\n\nThese safeguards are being applied to all postal votes.\n\nHow is the postal system coping?\n\nA record number of people have voted by post this time round, with more than 65 million sent in, according to one compilation of data from different states.\n\nGetty Images\n\nIn August, the head of the US Postal Service, Louis DeJoy, told lawmakers that the service was \"fully capable and committed\" to handling postal votes.",

        "text": "US Interests and African Agendas: Africa Policy After the 2024 Elections\nWashington will remain focused on balancing economic interests and security concerns, as both Democrats and Republicans acknowledge Africa's strategic importance in the shifting geopolitical landscape. However, the parties\u2019 differing approaches may influence how US policy is perceived by African and European partners.\n\nThree Priorities of US Africa Policy Amid Global Strategic Competition\n\nThe first US priority is strengthening economic relations with Africa. This will require continuing the effort to bolster US-African business ties by expanding initiatives such as the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) that boost trade and investment. The Trump administration initiated Prosper Africa, and President Biden rebooted it with an additional $80 million for investments in infrastructure, clean energy, and healthcare. The program highlights the economic benefits of transparent markets and business practices, contrasting them with the state-backed approaches of China and Russia. While initially focused on countering these international competitors, the initiative also opened doors to mutually beneficial partnerships in Africa. The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), officially launched in 2019 to foster economic integration throughout the continent, is another promising initiative to invest in African infrastructure and to encourage US companies to enter into public-private partnerships.\n\nThe second priority relates to Africa's importance as a key geopolitical player. While Democrats and Republicans share a bipartisan commitment to advancing US geopolitical interests on the continent, their views on competition with China and Russia may differ. Biden\u2019s administration continued Trump\u2019s approach to China but did not communicate a clear and comprehensive strategy. While Trump openly framed US engagement in Africa as a rivalry with China, Biden has avoided such direct competition. The next election\u2019s implications for the US approach to Russia will also be of enormous significance for US Africa policy, as the Russia-Ukraine war has already spilled over into West Africa.\n\nThe third priority concerns protecting US interests in increasingly insecure regions such as the Sahel and the Horn of Africa , which requires balancing support for international norms and democracy with security interests. Instability in the Sahel, combining worsening insurgent violence and frequent coups , exposes a lack of strategic clarity in US Africa policy. Since 2021, the Biden administration has tried to shift US engagement with Africa from Trump's transactional approach to one emphasizing democratic values. However, these tangible shifts in US diplomatic priorities have been limited by the presence of major and middle powers that have a different vision of the rules-based order, and by African leaders\u2019 increased selectivity when choosing long-term partners.\n\nContinuity and Change in the US Africa Trajectories\n\nLooking back at the Trump and Biden administrations\u2019 foreign policies towards Africa provides valuable insights into potential future scenarios.\n\nThe Kamala Harris campaign has not released an Africa policy. But a Harris administration would likely continue the Biden administration's Strategy Toward Sub-Saharan Africa, which focuses on multilateralism, addressing climate change, and fostering partnerships with African countries. Biden advocated for the African Union to join the G20\u2014it became a member in 2023\u2014and for greater African representation on the UN Security Council. Climate-friendly policies would likely remain a priority, building on the Inflation Reduction Act and promoting energy transitions. Additionally, if Harris\u2019s visits to Africa in 2023 are any indication, her policy would probably maintain a focus on human rights, women\u2019s empowerment, and LGBTQ+ rights. This approach would align with broader US Africa policy goals of enhancing democracy, developing trade, combating extremism, and fostering peaceful political transitions.\n\nUnder the Trump administration, US policy towards Africa prioritized economic growth and private sector investment over traditional aid mechanisms, shifting towards trade-driven priorities. A second Trump term is likely to focus on transactional gains for the United States and to prioritize economic and strategic benefits over long-term partnerships based on shared values. This approach may involve promoting US businesses in critical sectors to counter China's influence. Trump's administration would likely continue to emphasize fossil fuel development, opposing climate-focused initiatives. In a second term the former president might challenge initiatives such as climate reparations, for example, seeing them as contrary to US interests. Additionally, a Trump administration could alter relations with international institutions, as for example the former president\u2019s 2018 withdrawal from the UN Human Rights Council.\n\nFor many countries in Africa, the difference between Democratic and Republican administrations may seem negligible in practice. To earn trust, the newly elected US president, whoever they may be, should implement a new way of collaborating with African leaders, civil society, businesses, and the diaspora and must take into consideration their immediate and long-term development aspirations. US Africa strategy of the next administration should extend beyond traditional foci such as governance, democracy, and security, and incorporate African agendas at the international level related to climate adaptation and post-pandemic economic recovery. For the United States to compete with other global powers in Africa, considering African preferences and policy priorities will be key.\n\nThe EU Navigates US Politics in Africa\n\nBoth the United States and the EU are competing with China and Russia for access to resources in Africa. A Trump administration would likely emphasize immediate US interests, and its prioritization of strategic competition over long-term collaboration with Africa could strain relations with the EU, lead to a second withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, and exacerbate climate and environmental issues in Africa. Additionally, Trump\u2019s praise for strongmen such as Vladimir Putin and Viktor Orb\u00e1n might also undermine EU support for democracy in the region.\n\nHarris' approach is likely to prioritize diplomatic efforts to address shared challenges with African actors, and could foster closer EU collaboration with the continent on climate issues and on specific topics such as critical raw materials. The major risk for the US and the EU would be getting bogged down in geopolitical dynamics related to Africa. The EU and United States' geopolitical interests, such as countering competitors in Africa, should not be the sole factor in shaping their Africa policy, as this could give the impression that the interests of African countries are secondary.\n\nThe author thanks Lili Gabadadze for her research contribution to this piece.",

        "text": "3 Big Financial Worries For Americans Ahead of The Presidential Election\nKey Takeaways A majority of American investors are worried about how the upcoming presidential election could affect their personal finances, recent surveys found.\n\nThe main worries center around the potential impact of the election on retirement plans, the stock market and tax policy.\n\nExperts say stock market volatility and policy uncertainty are expected in an election year but that investors must stick to their long-term plans.\n\nAs the U.S. presidential election approaches, a majority of American investors are worried about how it could affect their personal finances.\n\nThe most recent MassMutual Consumer Spending & Saving Index report showed that 86% of those surveyed were concerned about the impact of the presidential election on their \u201cday-to-day finances.\u201d About a quarter of respondents said that personal finances are the most important factor in deciding who to vote for in November's contest between Republican candidate Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris.\n\nMost of the worries, according to other surveys and financial advisors, revolve around what a new administration could mean for retirement plans, stock market performance and tax policy.\n\n\"For those feeling concerned about the election, I\u2019d encourage them to talk with their advisor to ensure their financial plan is built to last, regardless of who\u2019s in office,\u201d said Ayako Yoshioka, a Portfolio Consulting Director at Wealth Enhancement.\n\n\n\nImpact on Retirement Plans\n\nA recent survey by Wealth Enhancement showed that 80% of respondents expect the election to affect their retirement plans in some way.\n\nSome investors are also worried about how the outcome of this election could influence how much they can rely on programs such as Social Security and Medicare and what the incoming administration would do about high prices.\n\nEven though inflation has come down, prices of many goods and services remain elevated. Roughly half of all people surveyed said that high inflation derailed their plans for retirement, delaying it by 8.5 years on average.\n\nFinancial advisors fielding questions from their anxious clients are telling them that some turbulence may be expected.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhile there is technically some type of uncertainty involved with elections, it's relatively short-lived,\u201d said Megan Gorman, Managing Partner at Chequers Financial Management, adding that advisors can help investors \u201ctune out the noise and stay focused on long-term goals.\u201d\n\nPotential for Stock Market Volatility\n\nMarkets may temporarily react to big news, election outcomes included. Nearly a quarter of respondents in the Wealth Enhancement survey worried about how stock markets would fare after the elections and what it would mean for their portfolios.\n\nJamie Bosse, a Kansas-based CFP at CGN Advisors, notes that despite volatility in election years, the majority of the past presidential election years have generally yielded positive market returns.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had 24 election years [since 1927]. And out of those 24, only four of those election years had negative [annual] market returns,\u201d Bosse said. The four years with negative returns\u20141932, 1940, 2000, and 2008\u2014included the Great Depression in 1932 and the Great Recession in 2008.\n\nIn fact, according to a T. Rowe Price analysis for data going back to 1927, there's not much difference in the average annual returns for the S&P 500\u2014a barometer index for U.S. stocks\u2014for election years (11%) compared to non-election years (11.6%).\n\n\"We believe that investment decisions should be based on longer\u2011term fundamentals, not near\u2011term political outcomes,\u201d researchers wrote in the T. Rowe Price analysis. \u201cTrying to time the market based on short\u2011term dynamics, political or otherwise, is extraordinarily difficult.\u201d\n\nUncertainty Around Tax Policy\n\nBoth Bosse and Gorman have had clients ask them about the future president\u2019s tax policies. And with good reason.\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) is a 2017 law that lowered income tax brackets, increased the standard deduction, and raised the estate tax exemption, among other things. The law is set to expire December 31, 2025, and if Congress doesn\u2019t act, it could make taxes even more complicated for some people.\n\nGorman's high-net-worth clients are particularly concerned with TCJA provisions related to the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap and the increased estate tax exemption.\n\nCatherine Valega, a Boston-based CFP at Green Bee Advisory, said she\u2019s been talking to clients about considering a Roth IRA conversion before income tax brackets potentially change.\n\nIn this strategy, you move your pre-tax retirement money from a traditional IRA into a post-tax Roth account. You may have to pay income tax at the time you convert, but the money would grow and withdrawals would be tax free. Such a conversion can prove to be a tax efficient if you expect to face higher taxes in the future.\n\n\u201cConversions are important to think about,\u201d Valega said, adding that investors should think about questions such as: Do we do them this year? Can we squeeze them in next year? What do our tax budgets look like?\n\n",

        "text": "Gunshots, threats ... and bureaucracy? The latest menace to the U.S. election\nGunshots fired into a Kamala Harris campaign office in Arizona. Repeat assassination plots against Donald Trump.\n\nSuspicious packages to election officials in more than 20 states , containing written threats or white powder.\n\nElection workers are being given gloves to handle mail; their offices are liaising with the FBI, Department of Justice and Homeland Security; staff are being trained in de-escalation.\n\nWelcome to the 2024 U.S. election. As early voting begins , so have threats against the election.\n\n\"It's certainly not a pleasant work environment,\" the executive director of North Carolina's elections board, Karen Bell, told reporters this week.\n\n\"[But] we are not going to be intimidated by this.\" She added a reminder to whoever is sending those packages: the election workers you're threatening might include your former teacher or your neighbour.\n\nThe 2020 U.S. election uncorked a threat environment that has not subsided, a new reality unleashed by Donald Trump's effort to overturn the last result.\n\nThe Brennan Center think-tank has a list of 14 threats to this year's election, based on actions from the 2020, 2022 and 2024 primary and general-election cycles.\n\nTheir list includes tampering with equipment ; flooding offices with challenges to voter registrations ; threats against election workers , which have prompted scores to resign or take security precautions, like hiding in an undisclosed location ; and many, many lawsuits , one of which briefly delayed mail voting this year in North Carolina (it's finally underway ).\n\nOne threat is growing in public attention: Chaos in the counties. Specifically, the certification process in Georgia has become national news.\n\nWATCH | How the Secret Service failed to protect Trump in Butler, Pa.: 'Preventable': How the Secret Service failed to protect Trump | About That Duration 13:47 How was a gunman able to come so close to assassinating former U.S. president Donald Trump during a campaign rally in Butler, Pa.? Andrew Chang breaks down a new report published by a bipartisan U.S. Senate committee that found the Secret Service's lack of organization and technical planning failed to keep Trump safe.\n\n'I think people woke up ... in 2020'\n\nIt's a remarkable shift for those who have long monitored these once-mundane electoral procedures.\n\n\"I've been on this job for 14 years and until 2020 I was never once asked a question about certification. So it's a new topic,\" said Wendy Underhill, director of elections for the National Council of State Legislatures (NCSL), an advisory body and advocate for state lawmakers.\n\n\"I think people woke up to that [new reality] in 2020.\"\n\nUnder pressure from Trump , a tooth-and-nail battle unfolded in 2020, with some counties and states just barely certifying that year's election.\n\nTrump's gambit has drawn criminal charges. He's accused of illegally working to delay the 2020 certification, hoping that Republicans in Congress would declare him the winner.\n\nThe tactic persisted beyond 2020.\n\nDozens of county officials have since refused to certify election results. Two years ago, a pair were charged criminally in a rural area of Arizona.\n\nTrump's plan in 2020: delay certification and get Congress to declare him the election winner. It ended with the attack by his supporters on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. (John Minchillo/The Associated Press)\n\nOne of the accused in Arizona admitted her stalling had nothing to do with problems in her county. She was protesting after Democrats did well in the 2022 midterms, and she was unhappy with the way the election was run outside Phoenix.\n\nIn New Mexico, another Trump-aligned election-denier explained why he tried blocking 2022 primary results: \"It's not based on any facts,\" he said. He had a gut feeling something was wrong.\n\nThese are snapshots from just some of the more than 3,000 counties in the U.S. In Pennsylvania alone, some counties have tried blocking certification of the 2022 primaries , the midterms and the 2024 primaries .\n\nWhich brings us to recent events in Georgia.\n\nWhat's going on in Georgia\n\nA Trump-supporting majority on the state elections board has, over the last two months, passed rules that could delay certification at the county level, which is a necessary precursor to confirming the result statewide.\n\nIn August, they created a rule allowing any official, on any elections board, in any of Georgia's 159 counties , to launch their own investigation before certifying the vote.\n\nGeorgia's state elections board meetings have grown nasty. John Fervier, the chairman, seen here at a Sept. 20 meeting, urged other members to tone down the partisan sniping and maintain some decorum. (Mike Stewart/AP)\n\nThe genesis of this is a Trump ally's refusal to certify the presidential primaries this year in her Atlanta-area county until she could investigate for fraud.\n\nThen, this month another rule from the state board required every neighbourhood polling station to hand-count ballots to ensure the total number matches that from the electronic counter. The rule doesn't make entirely clear what happens if there's a discrepancy.\n\nThe board faces lawsuits from not just Democrats but also Republicans , and a judge is expected to hear the challenges in a few days.\n\nGeorgia's secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, a Republican best known for resisting pressure from Trump to overturn the 2020 result, called the rules illegal , contrary to state law and a threat to the security of ballots.\n\nCounty officials say this dual-counting system has been tried before and it's a mess. Some complained at the board's meeting this month that it won't work.\n\nBut the board is drawing praise from one notable Republican: Trump. At a campaign rally in August, he personally mentioned three Republican board members by name, inviting the partisan crowd to cheer for one as she stood and waved.\n\n\"They're on fire. They're doing a great job,\" Trump said of the elections board. \"All pitbulls.\"\n\nMeetings have grown contentious at the grassroots level. Georgia's board members take pot shots at each other while seated at their podium.\n\nMichigan's state elections board just barely certified the result in 2020, when one Republican sided with Democrats. That contentious process drew pro- and anti-Trump protesters in the state capital, Lansing, in November 2020. (Paul Sancya/AP)\n\nOne accused the media and Democrats of misinforming the public about her intentions. Janice Johnston explained that the new rules aren't as onerous as portrayed; poll workers simply need to count the total ballots, not tally the votes for each party.\n\nAnother fumed that she was being defamed in interviews by another board member.\n\n\"You are attacking our reputation \u2014 our integrity,\" said Janelle King. \"They're calling us MAGA right-wing extremists. They don't even know who we are.\"\n\nKing is a conservative podcast host and former Republican official who questioned the 2020 election result and has appeared at events with Trump , praising his work as president. Johnston, her colleague, was the one waving to the crowd from her front-row seat at Trump's recent rally.\n\nChecks and balances in the system\n\nThis bureaucratic melodrama would hardly merit international interest if not for its role in electing a globally powerful office-holder: the U.S. president.\n\nSo how likely is it this county-level chaos might stall the election, abetting efforts to toss out votes and let Congress pick the president?\n\nExperts on election processes aren't that worried \u2014 for now.\n\n\"Is it a risk? Maybe. Is it a big risk? No,\" said Wendy Underhill of NCSL.\n\nWATCH | The assassination attempt on Trump at a Florida golf course: Trump targeted in suspected assassination attempt on golf course, FBI says Duration 3:08 The FBI is investigating a suspected assassination attempt against former president Donald Trump while he golfed in Florida. A man who hid in shrubbery near the golf course and pointed a high-powered rifle at Trump was arrested.\n\nHer sanguinity is supported by a thorough report from the legal group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.\n\nIt lists multiple potential paths to overcoming a baseless election obstruction, in one swing state after another. For example, states have legal penalties, both criminal and civil, as evidenced by Arizona's criminal charges.\n\nBeyond that, some states' election boards have the power to take over the process. And, finally, the report says, the federal government can step in, under laws on voting rights, civil rights, criminal conspiracy and several sections of the Constitution.\n\nTrey Hood, an elections expert at the University of Georgia, says he can foresee state courts nullifying the Georgia board rules, or suspending them until further review.\n\nA supporter is seen holding a 'Never surrender' sign during a Trump rally in Atlanta last month. (Umit Bektas/Reuters)\n\nAs for the substance of the rule changes, Hood called them inexplicable. \"Busy work\" is how he described them.\n\nAsked what's motivating all these changes, he gives the pro-Trump board members some benefit of the doubt: he doesn't think they're aiming to cheat.\n\nInstead, he points to polls that consistently show a clear majority of Republicans believe the 2020 election was stolen, as Trump keeps telling them. As a result, these officials created, in his view, unnecessary or complicated new guardrails.\n\n\"There's a widespread belief [the 2020 election was stolen],\" said Hood. \"I don't think that's ever going to change, unfortunately.\"\n\nIn an environment like this, certification is just one flavour of trouble. In the 2024 U.S. election, there are about a dozen others.",

        "text": "US Charges Iranian Hackers For Interfering In 2024 Presidential Election\nAhead of the 2024 US presidential election, the Justice Department has unveiled charges against three Iranian hackers accused of disrupting Donald Trump\u2019s campaign.\n\nWhat Happened: The U.S. Justice Department unsealed charges against three Iranian hackers for disrupting Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, Reuters reported on Friday.\n\nThe accused are members of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards Corps. They allegedly targeted the Nov. 5 election between former President Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nIran dismissed the accusations as baseless. The Justice Department has also targeted Russian election interference, charging and sanctioning state media employees for funding pro-Trump influencers.\n\nSee Also: Mark Cuban Fires Back At Criticism Of Kamala Harris Tax Policies\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland stated that the hackers \u2014 Masoud Jalili, Seyyed Ali Aghamiri, and Yasar Balaghi \u2014 aimed to undermine Trump\u2019s campaign. \u201cWe are seeing increasingly aggressive Iranian cyber activity during this election cycle,\u201d Garland said.\n\nThe indictment alleges the hackers used fake email accounts to deceive campaign officials, stealing emails and internal documents, which were then leaked to the media and Joe Biden\u2018s campaign. Charges include wire fraud, identity theft, and computer fraud.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department also imposed sanctions on the three men and other Revolutionary Guard members. The hackers are currently in Iran, out of U.S. law enforcement\u2019s reach. Garland emphasized the Justice Department\u2019s commitment to pursuing these individuals indefinitely.\n\nWhy It Matters: The charges against the Iranian hackers come amid heightened concerns over foreign interference in U.S. elections.\n\nIn August, Trump\u2019s campaign confirmed a security breach, believed to be orchestrated by foreign entities hostile to the U.S. This breach included the theft of internal documents, which were later leaked to the media.\n\nFurthermore, Meta Platforms Inc. also thwarted an attempt by Iranian hackers to target both Trump and Biden\u2019s campaigns via WhatsApp accounts linked to the hacking group APT42. This group has been identified by tech giants like Google as an \u201cIranian state-sponsored cyber espionage actor.\u201d\n\nIn addition, U.S. intelligence agencies revealed that Iran tried to share hacked Trump campaign data with Biden\u2019s team. According to a joint statement by the FBI, ODNI, and CISA, Iranian cyber actors sent unsolicited emails containing stolen Trump campaign material to individuals associated with Biden\u2019s campaign.\n\nMoreover, OpenAI uncovered and dismantled a covert Iranian influence operation using ChatGPT to manipulate public opinion during the 2024 elections.

        "text": "Iranian Cyber Actors (IRGC) - Targeting the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election\nIntro\n\nYesterday, the FBI released an advisory covering the activities of Iranian cyber actors targeting email accounts associated with the 2024 U.S. presidential election. The advisory was published in collaboration with U.S. Cyber Command's Cyber National Mission Force, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and the UK\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre. The advisory has been disseminated to highlight the ongoing malicious cyber activity by cyber actors working on behalf of the Iranian government's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).\n\nThree IRGC Cyber Actors have been indicted for \u2018Hack-and-Leak\u2019 operation designed to influence the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election. According the the information released by DOJ, as alleged, in or around May, after several years of focusing on compromising the accounts of former U.S. government officials, the conspirators used some of the same hacking infrastructure from earlier in the conspiracy to begin targeting and successfully gaining unauthorized access to personal accounts belonging to persons associated with an identified U.S. Presidential campaign, including campaign officials.\n\nThe identified IRGC cyber activity also targeted individuals with a nexus to Iranian and Middle Eastern affairs, such as current or former senior government officials, senior think tank personnel, journalists, activists, and lobbyists. Additionally, the FBI has observed these actors targeting individuals associated with U.S. political campaign activity, likely in support of information operations.\n\nIn the joint statement by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), officials outlined: \u201cAs each of us has indicated in prior public statements, Iran seeks to stoke discord and undermine confidence in our democratic institutions. Iran has furthermore demonstrated a longstanding interest in exploiting societal tensions through various means, including the use of cyber operations to attempt to gain access to sensitive information related to U.S. elections. In addition to these sustained efforts to complicate the ability of any U.S. administration to pursue a foreign policy at odds with Iran\u2019s interests, the Intelligence Community (IC) has previously reported that Iran perceives this year\u2019s elections to be particularly consequential in terms of the impact they could have on its national security interests, increasing Tehran\u2019s inclination to shape the outcome. We have observed increasingly aggressive Iranian activity during this election cycle, specifically involving influence operations targeting the American public and cyber operations targeting presidential campaigns.\u201d\n\nSocial Engineering and Information Operations\n\n\n\nThe cyber actors working on behalf of the IRGC gain access to victims\u2019 personal and business accounts using social engineering techniques, often impersonating professional contacts on email or messaging platforms. In addition, these actors might attempt to impersonate known email service providers to solicit sensitive user security information on email or messaging platforms. The targets usually have some nexus to Iranian and Middle Eastern affairs, such as current or former senior government officials, senior think tank personnel, journalists, activists, and lobbyists. More recently, FBI has observed these actors targeting persons associated with US political campaigns.\n\n\n\nThe actors often attempt to build rapport before soliciting victims to access a document via a hyperlink, which redirects victims to a false email account login page for the purpose of capturing credentials. Victims may be prompted to input two-factor authentication codes, provide them via a messaging application, or interact with phone notifications to permit access to the cyber actors. Victims sometimes gain access to the document but may receive a login error.\n\nCyber actors working on behalf of the IRGC tailor instances of social engineering to include areas of interest or relevance to a target, including:\n\n\u2022 Impersonations of known individuals, associates, and/or family members;\n\n\u2022 Impersonations of known email service providers regarding account settings;\n\n\u2022 Requests from impersonation accounts of well-known journalists for interviews;\n\n\u2022 Conference invitations;\n\n\u2022 Speaking engagement requests;\n\n\u2022 Embassy events;\n\n\u2022 Foreign policy discussions/opinions and article reviews; and,\n\n\u2022 Current US campaigns and elections.\n\n\n\nIndications of successful compromise include:\n\n\u2022 Suspicious logins to victim accounts from foreign or domestic IP addresses;\n\n\u2022 Creation of message handling rules to forward emails and prevent victims from receiving notifications of the compromise;\n\n\u2022 Connection of unknown devices, applications, or accounts to a victim account;\n\n\u2022 Exfiltration and deletion of messages; and,\n\n\u2022 Attempts to access other victim accounts\n\nIndicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\n\n\nCyber actors working on behalf of the IRGC have used the following malicious domains:\n\n\n\n3dauth[.]live\n\n3dconfirrnation[.]com\n\naccesscheckout[.]online\n\naccessverification[.]online\n\naccunt-loqin[.]ml\n\naccurateprivacy[.]online\n\natlantic-council[.]com\n\nbitly[.]org[.]il\n\nboom-boom[.]ga\n\nbytli[.]us\n\ncontinuetogo[.]me\n\ncontinue-to-your-account[.]000webhostapp[.]com\n\ncovi19questionaire[.]000webhostapp[.]com\n\ncovid19questionnaire[.]freesite[.]vip\n\ncss-ethz[.]ch\n\ncutly[.]biz\n\ncutly[.]vip\n\ndaemon-mailer[.]com\n\nde-ma[.]online\n\ndirect-access[.]info\n\ndiscovery-protocol[.]ml\n\ndocfileview[.]org\n\ndoctransfer[.]online\n\ndreamycareer[.]com\n\ndr-sup[.]live\n\nemail-daemon[.]site\n\nemail-protection[.]online\n\nfile-access[.]com\n\nfiletransfer[.]club\n\nfreahman[.]online\n\nfreshconnect[.]live\n\ngdrive-files[.]com\n\ngettogether[.]quest\n\ngl-sup[.]online\n\ngm-sup[.]com\n\ng-shorturl[.]com\n\nhome[.]kg\n\nidccovid19questionaire[.]000webhostapp[.]com\n\nipsss[.]000webhostapp[.]com\n\nlinkauthenticator[.]online\n\nlitby[.]us\n\nlovetoflight[.]com\n\nlst-accurate[.]com\n\nltf[.]world\n\nmailerdaemon[.]info\n\nmailer-daemon[.]live\n\nmailer-daemon[.]me\n\nmailer-daemon[.]net\n\nmailer-daemon[.]online\n\nmailer-daemon[.]org\n\nmailer-daemon[.]site\n\nmailer-daemon[.]us\n\nmailer-daemon-message[.]co\n\nmailer-support[.]online\n\nmfa-ic[.]ae\n\nmofa-ic[.]ae\n\nmyconnect-support[.]com\n\non-dr[.]com\n\nprivate-file-sharing[.]000webhostapp[.]com\n\nqmaiil[.]ml\n\nreactivate-disabled-accuonts[.]000webhostapp[.]com\n\nredirect-drive[.]online\n\nsafeshortl[.]ink\n\nshared-files-access[.]live\n\nsharefilesonline[.]live\n\nsummit-files[.]com\n\ntinyurl[.]co[.]il\n\ntinyurl[.]ink\n\ntinyurl[.]live\n\nuani[.]us\n\nverificationservice[.]online\n\nwashingtonlnstitute[.]org\n\nworkstation2020[.]000webhostapp[.]com\n\nwww-myaccounts-support[.]000webhostapp[.]com\n\nyoutransfer[.]live\n\nThe above-mentioned indicators are historical infrastructure associated with cyber actors working on behalf of IRGC. This data is being provided for informational purposes, to facilitate the identification of past cyber incidents, and to enable better tracking and attribution of these cyber actors.\n\n\n\nThe IGRC activity was especially notable in the period of the Munich Security Conference and the Think 20 (T20) Summit in Saudi Arabia. The identified attacks were attributed to Phosphorus, an Iranian actor; TAG-56, which targeted the Sir Bani Yas Forum; and APT42, an Iranian state-sponsored cyber espionage actor targeting Western and Middle Eastern NGOs, media organizations, academia, legal services, and activists.\n\nFalse Flags and Deception\n\nSome of the domains involved in malicious activity impersonated Israeli online-services and resources by origin. For example, one of the domain names used by Iran in the attack against international conference attendees was registered using the personal records of an Israeli citizen, which could have been re-used from compromised identity information or data sets circulating on the Dark Web to obscure the origin.\n\nDomain Name: DE-MA.ONLINE\n\nRegistrar Url: https://www.hostinger.com\n\nRegistrar Name: Hostinger, UAB\n\nRegistrar Iana Id: H2712453\n\nDomain Status: REDEMPTIONPERIOD https://icann.org/epp#redemptionPeriod\n\nRegistrant Id: Not Available From Registry\n\nRegistrant Name: Omer Laviv\n\nRegistrant Organisation: Omer Laviv\n\nRegistrant Street: 25 Gordon st.\n\nRegistrant City: Givataim\n\nRegistrant State: Central\n\nRegistrant Postal Code: 53235\n\nRegistrant Country: IL\n\nRegistrant Phone: +972539820866\n\nRegistrant Email: 20thcenfax@gmail.com\n\n'Hack-and-Leak' Operations\n\nPrior to the advisory about the targeting of current and former U.S. officials, the FBI, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the Department of Defense (DoD) Cyber Crime Center (DC3) released details, explaining how Iranian hackers are working with ransomware affiliates and providing access to victim networks in exchange for a cut of ransom payments. The law enforcement organizations noted that the described activity was not connected to the Iranian election influence efforts, highlighting the truly multifarious threat that Iranian cyber activity poses to U.S. interests.\n\nThe group of Iranian cyber actors that has conducted a high volume of computer network intrusion attempts against U.S. organizations since 2017 and as recently as August 2024. Compromised organizations include U.S.-based schools, municipal governments, financial institutions, and healthcare facilities. This group is known in the private sector by the names Pioneer Kitten, Fox Kitten, UNC757, Parisite, RUBIDIUM, and Lemon Sandstorm. The actors also refer to themselves by the moniker Br0k3r, and as of 2024, they have been operating under the moniker \u201cxplfinder\u201d in their channels. FBI analysis and investigation indicate the group\u2019s activity is consistent with a cyber actor with Iranian state-sponsorship.\n\n\n\nThe FBI previously observed these actors attempt to monetize their access to victim organizations on cyber marketplaces. A significant percentage of the group\u2019s US-focused cyber activity is in furtherance of obtaining and maintaining technical access to victim networks to enable future ransomware attacks. The actors offer full domain control privileges, as well as domain admin credentials, to numerous networks worldwide. More recently, the FBI identified these actors collaborating directly with ransomware affiliates to enable encryption operations in exchange for a percentage of the ransom payments. These actors have collaborated with the ransomware affiliates NoEscape, Ransomhouse, and ALPHV (aka BlackCat).\n\n\n\nThe Iranian cyber actors\u2019 involvement in these ransomware attacks goes beyond providing access; they work closely with ransomware affiliates to lock victim networks and strategize on approaches to extort victims. The FBI assesses these actors do not disclose their Iran-based location to their ransomware affiliate contacts and are intentionally vague as to their nationality and origin. Furthermore, the FBI has historically observed this actor conduct hack-and-leak campaigns, such as the late 2020 campaign known as Pay2Key. The actors operated a .onion site (reachable through the Tor browser) hosted on cloud infrastructure registered to an organization previously compromised by the actors.\n\n\n\nFollowing the compromise and the subsequent unauthorized acquisition of victim data, the actors publicized news of their compromise (including on social media), tagging accounts of victim and media organizations, and leaking victim data on their .onion site. While this technique has traditionally been used to influence victims to pay ransoms, the FBI does not believe the objective of Pay2Key was to obtain ransom payments.Rather, the FBI assesses Pay2Key was an information operation aimed at undermining the security of Israel-based cyber infrastructure.\n\nSuch malicious cyber activity from Iran is expected to continue in the future, targeting the U.S. and its allies during important social, economic, and political events, considering the close overlap between the cybercriminal underground and nation-states.\n\nInsider Threat\n\nBesides direct threats to elections from a cybersecurity perspective, the intelligence community is taking proactive measures against the risks of espionage and insider threats. Separately from the identification of IRGC-affiliated actors involved in election interference, in a separate case, a former government contractor was indicted Friday for acting as an illegal agent for the Iranian government, according to the Department of Justice.\n\nFormer Federal Aviation Administration contractor, Abouzar Rahmati, 42, a naturalized U.S. citizen and resident of Great Falls, Virginia, was indicted for acting and conspiring to act as an agent of the Iranian government in the United States without prior notice to the Attorney General. Rahmati, a naturalized U.S. citizen and resident of Great Falls, Virginia, previously was an Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) 1st Lt., a branch of the Iranian Armed Forces, from June 2009 to May 2010.\n\nAccording to the indictment, from at least December 2017 through June 2024, Rahmati conspired with Iranian government officials and intelligence operatives to act on their behalf in the United States, including by meeting with Iranian intelligence officers in Iran, communicating with coconspirators using a cover story to hide his conduct, obtaining employment with an FAA contractor with access to sensitive non-public information, and obtaining open-source and non-public materials about the U.S. solar energy industry and providing it to Iranian intelligence.\n\nUnless this episode is not related to possible election interference, it confirms the high activity of foreign intelligence and insider threat that may be targeting the U.S enterprises.\n\nInfluence Operations with Generated and Manipulated Media\n\nIn a recent update by ODNI, foreign actors are using generative AI technology to boost their respective efforts to influence U.S. elections. Generative AI is helping to improve and accelerate aspects of foreign influence operations but thus far the IC has not seen it revolutionize such operations. The risk to U.S. elections from foreign AI-generated content depends on the ability of foreign actors to overcome restrictions built into many AI tools and remain undetected, develop their own sophisticated models, and strategically target and disseminate such content.\n\n\n\nMethods to accomplish this include laundering material through prominent figures, publishing on inauthentic social media accounts or websites pretending to be legitimate news outlets, or releasing supposed \u201cleaks\u201d of AI-generated content that appear sensitive or controversial.\n\nMitigation Measures\n\n\n\nFBI, CNMF, Treasury, and UK NCSC recommend international community partners remain vigilant. The authoring agencies recommend the following mitigation actions:\n\nSocial Engineering/Spoofing\n\n\u2022 Be suspicious of unsolicited contact from any individual you do not know personally or contact from people you may know but are claiming to be using new accounts or phone numbers.\n\n\u2022 Be suspicious of attempts to pass links or files via social media from anyone you do not know or from people you know who are using new accounts or phone numbers.\n\n\u2022 Be suspicious of unsolicited requests to share files via online services, especially from people you do not know or people with whom you typically do not share files in this manner.\n\n\u2022 Be suspicious of email messages conveying suspicious alerts for online accounts, including login notifications from foreign countries or other alerts indicating attempted unauthorized access to your accounts. FBI recommends logging into your accounts directly (versus using a link to do so) to review alerts.\n\n\u2022 Be suspicious of emails purporting to be from legitimate online services (i.e. the images in the email appear to be slightly pixelated and/or grainy, language in the email seems off, sender email address looks suspicious, messages originate from an IP not attributable to that provider/company, etc.).\n\n\u2022 Be suspicious of unsolicited email messages that contain shortened links (i.e. via tinyurl, bit.ly, etc.).\n\n\n\nEnterprise Mitigation\n\n\u2022 Implement a user training program with phishing exercises to raise and maintain awareness among users about risks of visiting malicious websites or opening malicious attachments. Reinforce the appropriate user response to phishing and spear-phishing emails. Cyber hygiene awareness for personal accounts and company accounts is strongly recommended.\n\n\u2022 Recommend using only official email accounts for official business, updating software, avoiding clicking on links or opening attachments from suspicious emails before confirming their authenticity with the sender, and turning on multi-factor authentication to improve online security and safety.\n\n\u2022 Recommend users consider advanced account protection services and hardware security keys.\n\n\u2022 Enable anti-phishing and anti-spoofing security features that block malicious email.\n\n\u2022 Prohibit automatic forwarding of email to external addresses\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "US DOJ charges three men in Iran cyber-plot to undermine US election\nThe US Justice Department (DOJ) indicted three Iranian men on Friday, accusing them of orchestrating Iran\u2019s alleged hack-and-leak operation targeting Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. The charges outline a sweeping effort to steal sensitive data from current and former government officials and to undermine trust in the presidential election.\n\nAccording to the indictment, the conspirators fixed their focus on the presidential campaign starting in May after years of compromising the accounts of former US government officials. Using the same hacking effort, they successfully infiltrated personal accounts connected to the campaign, including those of top officials, and obtained confidential documents and emails. By late June, their activities intensified into a \u201chack-and-leak\u201d campaign, using the stolen material as a weapon to sway the political narrative and disrupt the election process. The DOJ stated that the hackers also contacted the Biden-Harris campaign, offering access to Trump\u2019s debate preparation material.\n\nUS Attorney General Merrick B. Garland stated in a press release on Friday: \u201cThe Justice Department is working relentlessly to uncover and counter Iran\u2019s cyberattacks aimed at stoking discord, undermining confidence in our democratic institutions, and influencing our elections.\u201d He added: \u201cThe American people \u2013 not Iran, or any other foreign power \u2013 will decide the outcome of our country\u2019s elections.\u201d\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray said:\n\nToday\u2019s charges represent the culmination of a thorough and long-running FBI investigation that has resulted in the indictment of three Iranian nationals for their roles in a wide-ranging hacking campaign sponsored by the Government of Iran \u2026 The conduct laid out in the indictment is just the latest example of Iran\u2019s brazen behavior. So today the FBI would like to send a message to the Government of Iran \u2013 you and your hackers can\u2019t hide behind your keyboards.\n\nThe indictment claimed that the activity of the three men \u201cis part of Iran\u2019s continuing efforts to stoke discord, erode confidence in the US electoral process, and unlawfully acquire information\u201d to aid Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). The DOJ alleged that the Iranian hackers sought this information to \u201cavenge the death of Qasem Soleimani,\u201d a commander in the IRGC. The US military killed Soleimani in a January 2020 drone strike, prompting Iran to vow retaliation. Since then, US officials have monitored multiple revenge plots.\n\nThe hacker trio faces charges of conspiracy to steal information, wire fraud, identity theft, and providing material support to the IRGC, a designated foreign terrorist organization. However, this doesn\u2019t guarantee they\u2019ll stand trial in the US, as cybercriminals often operate from countries that refuse to extradite them.\n\nAmong those targeted by Iran was Ginni Thomas, a conservative activist and the wife of US Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, as part of a campaign to impersonate prominent figures connected to Donald Trump. Between April and May 2024, they used a fake persona in her name to send spearphishing emails to a former homeland security adviser and other high-profile targets.\n\nThe tactics from Iran are far from new. US intelligence officials point out that Iran\u2019s attempts to fuel division and disrupt Trump\u2019s bid to win the presidency are a replay of the interference strategies they employed in 2020. In a joint statement on September 18, the Office of te Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) warned: \u201cForeign actors are increasing their election influence activities as we approach November.\u201d They highlighted that \u201cRussia, Iran, and China are trying by some measure to exacerbate divisions in US society for their own benefit\u201d and view election periods as \u201cmoments of vulnerability.\u201d They emphasized that any attempts to undermine democratic institutions are a \u201cdirect threat to the US and will not be tolerated.\u201d",

        "text": "VP debates rarely matter - the Walz v Vance showdown is different\nVP debates rarely matter - the Walz v Vance showdown is different\n\nGetty Images\n\nDemocrat Tim Walz and Republican JD Vance will meet for their one and only vice-presidential debate on Tuesday night in New York City. While the stakes in these kind of running-mate face-offs are typically low \u2013 an undercard to the presidential main event - this one might be different. In a tight race that could be decided by tens of thousands of votes in a handful of states, every opportunity to generate positive attention and political momentum is precious. At the very least, the debate will be a fascinating contrast between two men with very different styles and political beliefs and two campaigns with distinct strategies for winning the White House. Donald Trump announced his selection of Vance back in July, at the start of the Republican National Convention and just a day after his near-assassination. The former president was riding high in the polls, and his pick of the 40-year-old Ohio senator was viewed not only as a play to the white working class in the industrial Midwest \u2013 a key demographic in a region that is a top electoral battleground \u2013 but also as a way to establish his political legacy.\n\nUnlike Trump\u2019s first vice-president, Mike Pence, Vance is an ideological kindred spirit, whose focus on trade and immigration match Trump\u2019s top political priorities. If Vance was a front-runner to be Trump\u2019s running-mate, Walz\u2019s path to the Democratic number-two spot was considerably more unlikely. After Joe Biden abandoned his re-election bid, Vice-President Kamala Harris stepped in as the standard bearer and shortly thereafter began her ticket-mate search. Walz, the governor of Minnesota, was not a leading contender for the job, but his viral appearances on television, deriding Republicans as \u201cweird\u201d, and his ability to defend liberal policies in moderate-friendly language won Harris over.\n\nWatch: JD Vance's journey from 'Never Trumper' to VP pick\n\nVance sells Trump\u2019s message to disaffected America\n\nOn the campaign trail, both men have sought to put the political skills that earned them the running-mate jobs to work. Vance is polished and practised \u2013 a former Silicon Valley venture capitalist with an Ivy League pedigree that belies his rural Appalachian roots. Walz is a high-school teacher turned politician with a penchant for folksy Midwestern humour. Vance has been a frequent advocate for the Trump campaign on mainstream media news programmes. He\u2019s also rallied potential supporters in rural areas of the Midwestern battleground states, part of the Trump campaign\u2019s strategy of engaging sympathetic voters who may not have participated in previous elections. Last week in Traverse City, Michigan, Vance gave his standard stump speech, which is focused on immigration, the economy and trade. \u201cWe\u2019re going to pursue some commonsense tax and economic policies,\u201d he told the crowd of a few thousand cheering supporters gathered in a local fair ground. \u201cWe will do it with American workers rather than foreign slave labourers.\u201d While many of the rally attendees didn\u2019t know much about Vance prior to his selection as candidate for vice-president, they said they liked what they had heard so far - even as Vance has frequently flirted with controversy. His amplification of untrue rumours that Haitian migrants were stealing and eating pets in Ohio is a recent example.\n\nWalz appeals to voters Harris struggles to reach\n\nThe Democrat has been a regular fixture in more rural areas of the battleground states - often appearing in places that are traditionally more conservative. As a former high school football coach, he\u2019s sought to play up his background and links to America\u2019s most popular sport. On Saturday, he was at the Michigan-Minnesota college football game which was played in front of a crowd of 110,000. When Harris introduced Walz as her vice-presidential pick at a Philadelphia rally in early August, she repeatedly referred to him as \u201cCoach Walz\u201d - and highlighted his high-school teacher background. The Democrats may be hoping his plainspoken, salt-of-the-earth appeal could cut into the Republican margins outside major metropolitan areas. \u201cIn Minnesota, we respect our neighbours and their personal choices that they make,\" Walz said in Philadelphia. \u201cEven if we wouldn\u2019t make the same choice for ourselves, there\u2019s a golden rule: Mind your own damn business.\u201d\n\nWho is Tim Walz? The Minnesota governor calls his rivals \"weird\"\n\nHow will the candidates attack each other?\n\nDuring Tuesday night\u2019s debate, Vance is likely to continue to hammer Democrats on the economy, immigration and crime \u2013 areas where polls show Trump and the Republicans are favoured. He could accuse Walz of being slow to react to the sometimes violent demonstrations in Minnesota following the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police and highlight some of the more controversial liberal policies Walz enacted as governor, including around transgender rights. He may also point to Walz\u2019s sometimes contradictory statements about his record serving in the Minnesota National Guard. Walz may counter by highlighting Vance\u2019s past controversial statements \u2013 on Ohio Haitians and his derisive remarks about Democratic women who don\u2019t have children being \u201cchildless cat ladies\u201d. He may also note Vance\u2019s connections to people who oversaw Project 2025, the proposed governing agenda advanced by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. He is also sure to shift the focus onto the social issues where Democrats are stronger \u2013 such as healthcare, the environment and, most prominently, abortion rights.\n\nMore on the US election\n\nThe men who would be a heartbeat from the presidency\n\nBoth men had relatively low profiles in national politics prior to their elevation to their respective presidential tickets. Vance, who has served less than two years in the US Senate, is best known for best-selling memoir, Hillbilly Elegy. Walz has a longer political record, serving as governor and as a congressman from a rural area of Minnesota, but he was never in the top ranks of party leadership. The two will have the opportunity to introduce themselves to millions of Americans for the first time on Tuesday night \u2013 and their performance could reflect on the judgement and decision-making skill of the presidential nominees who selected them. The spotlight on Vance may be particularly sharp, given that Trump, if he wins, will be the oldest person ever elected president. Vance could also take the opportunity to provide ideological depth and detail to Trump\u2019s conservative populism, as he did during his July Republican convention speech. For Walz, it\u2019s a chance not only to help Americans learn more about him as a candidate, but about a Democratic ticket that did not exist two months ago \u2013 one that, according to polls, many Americans still are uncertain of. If he can do that in a way that appeals to moderate and independent voters \u2013 his touted strength \u2013 all the better for the Harris camp. Typically, the vice-presidential debate happens in the midst of a series of presidential debates \u2013 an interlude between the candidate showdowns that really matter. With no further presidential debates scheduled this year, however, the running-mate face-off could be the last chance for American voters to see the two tickets represented in direct contrast before they cast their ballots.",

        "text": "Securing the Border\nBorder Status Entry Suspended and Limited for Certain Noncitizens as of June 5, 2024, per Presidential Proclamation 10773, as amended by the Presidential Proclamation of September 27, 2024.\n\nPresident Biden signed Presidential Proclamation 10773 to temporarily suspend and limit the entry of certain noncitizens at the southern border because there were high numbers of encounters straining the U.S. immigration system, and the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice issued an interim final rule that limits asylum eligibility and further enhances consequences at the border. Subsequently, President Biden amended Presidential Proclamation 10773\u2019s threshold calculations pursuant to the Presidential Proclamation of September 27, 2024, and the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice issued a final rule implementing changes that parallel those made in the September 27 Proclamation.\n\nThis suspension and limitation on entry and associated measures will apply until 14 calendar days after there has been 28-consecutive-calendar-days of a 7-consecutive-calender-day average of less than 1,500 encounters. The suspension and limitation on entry will continue to, or again, apply if there has been a 7-consecutive-calendar-day average of 2,500 encounters or more.\n\nThe Interim Final Rule made three key changes to processing under Title 8 immigration authorities during periods of high border encounters when the provisions of the Proclamation are in effect.\n\nFirst, noncitizens who cross the southern border unlawfully or without authorization, and who are not excepted from the Proclamation, are generally ineligible for asylum, absent exceptionally compelling circumstances.\n\nSecond, noncitizens who cross the southern border, who are not excepted from the Proclamation, and are processed for expedited removal will only be referred for a credible fear screening with an Asylum Officer if they manifest or express a fear of return to their country or country of removal, a fear of persecution or torture, or an intention to apply for asylum.\n\nThird, the U.S. continues to adhere to its international obligations and commitments by screening individuals who manifest or express a fear as noted above, but who do not qualify for the exceptionally compelling circumstances exception to the Rule, for withholding of removal and Convention Against Torture protections at a reasonable probability of persecution or torture standard \u2013 a new, substantially higher standard than is applied under the Circumvention of Lawful Pathways rule.\n\nWhat this Means for Intending Migrants\n\nAs of June 5, 2024, U.S. immigration enforcement and asylum procedures across the southern border are more strict. Our message remains: Migrants should use safe, lawful, and orderly pathways to come to the United States.\n\nNoncitizens whose entry is suspended, including those who cross unlawfully between ports of entry instead of using a lawful pathway will generally, not be eligible for asylum and face a higher screening standard for other forms of protection. Noncitizens who do not establish a legal basis to remain in the United States will:\n\nbe promptly removed to their home country or a third country,\n\nface at least a 5-year bar on re-entry, and\n\nconfront possible criminal charges for a subsequent unlawful reentry.\n\nCrossing the United States\u2019 border between the ports of entry is dangerous and illegal. Migrants face many dangers along the journey. Smugglers, criminals, cartels, and bad actors prey on vulnerable migrants, who risk kidnapping, extortion, and other threats to their personal safety. The terrain is hazardous, risking medical issues like injuries, heat stroke and dehydration, or drowning. Migrants should not put themselves or their family at grave risk. Migrants who are caught crossing the border unlawfully will face arrest, likely detention, and removal from the United States by the Department of Homeland Security. Migrants can face significant consequences: removal from the United States, a five-year bar to return to the US, and potential additional criminal penalties for a subsequent unlawful reentry that remain on their permanent record for years.\n\nLimited Exceptions\n\nThe suspension and limitation on entry does not apply to noncitizens who use a lawful, safe, and orderly process for the entry into the United States\u2014including the CBP One mobile application\u2019s appointment scheduling function. Noncitizens may continue to seek an appointment to present themselves in a safe and orderly manner at a designated southwest border land port of entry by using the CBP One\u2122 mobile app.\n\nIn addition, the Proclamation and rule do not apply to lawful permanent residents, other noncitizens with a valid visa or other lawful permission to enter the United States, unaccompanied children, and victims of a severe form of human trafficking.\n\nThe following chart provides the dates that the Proclamation and Securing the Border Rule provisions applied.\n\nStart Date End Date June 5, 2024 at 12:01AM EDT To be announced\n\nRelated Links\n\nFor additional information on the Federal Government response to Secure the Border, please visit the official newsroom on CBP.gov or ICE.gov.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions",

        "text": "Adam Boulton: JD Vance v Tim Walz - why the vice presidential debate could sway US election\nTV debates have mattered more than ever before in this year's US presidential election.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's pitiful performance on 27 June effectively knocked the incumbent out of the race for the White House.\n\nThen on 10 September Biden's replacement, vice president Kamala Harris, proved she is a real contender, baiting her opponent Donald Trump into wild statements such as \"they're eating the pets!\".\n\nThe Democrats have recovered in the polls since Harris took over the nomination, including in so-called swing states, to the point that she is now narrow favourite to beat Trump, according to some respected analysts.\n\nOthers still reckon the Republican Trump will be re-elected. Either way, all agree the contest is on a knife edge with voting already under way in a handful of less populated states, and opening next week in Illinois.\n\nWith things so close, the televised debate next Tuesday could even tip the balance.\n\n\"All the needle needs to be moved is 0.1% in either direction, and that could be the difference in four or five states,\" according to Steven Maviglio, a Democratic strategist.\n\nSpreaker Spreaker , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

This latest debate in CBS studios in New York City on 1 October is between their running mates, JD Vance and Tim Walz.\n\nIn most years vice presidential debates are sideshows which have little impact on the voters. Not this year.\n\nThe rise of Harris to presidential candidate has shown Americans that VPs are important. Just as Trump had to scramble to find a new running mate following stinging condemnation from Mike Pence, the man who served as his vice president for four years.\n\nAdding to the excitement, the two men who will be facing off this week are also the best phrase-makers in this campaign.\n\nImage: Donald Trump and JD Vance. Pic: AP\n\nVance wrote bestselling book Hillbilly Elegy, based on his rough upbringing in the Appalachians. He likes to launch sweeping attacks on his foes, including dismissing Democratic women as \"childless cat ladies\". Taylor Swift embraced this jibe for herself in her recent post endorsing Harris.\n\nWalz probably owes his place on the ticket to the single word \"weird\", which he spent the summer sticking on Trump and Vance to devastating effect in multiple media interviews on behalf of the Democratic campaign.\n\nThe confrontation between the two men promises to be spicy.\n\nThere is a generation gap between them. Walz is 60. Vance is 20 years younger. Walz likes to present himself as a folksy centrist dad. In The Manual, a signature campaign commercial, Walz sets about fixing his old car, \"a '79 International Harvester Scout\", while likening it to creating an opportunity economy for all.\n\nHe is also a veteran democratic politician having served 12 years in Washington in the US House of Representatives before being elected Governor of Minnesota in 2018, the post he still holds.\n\nVance's career has been meteoric. Four years in US Marine Corps provided his ladder to university. Then he became a corporate lawyer for investment firms.\n\nFollowing the success of his book, his backers included the controversial tech titans Peter Thiel, Eric Schmidt and Marc Andreessen. After a lightning campaign in 2022, he is currently a first-term Republican US Senator for Ohio.\n\nImage: JD Vance wrote the bestseller Hillbilly Elegy based on his upbringing.

Vance was a journalist in uniform during his four years which included deployment to Iraq. Walz belonged to the Minnesota National Guard for 24 years.\n\nThe Harris campaign admitted he \"misspoke\" when he described assault rifles as \"weapons of war that I carried in war\".\n\nThe two \"VP picks\" share archetypal middle-American backgrounds, Nebraska and Minnesota for Walz and Kentucky and Ohio for Vance, which were major factors in why they were chosen as running mates. Harris is from California, Trump from New York City and Florida, all of which are regarded as coastal fleshpots by citizens in \"flyover states\".\n\nMichigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona; the main candidates are all concentrating their campaigning on the battleground states - those most likely to \"flip\" decisively for one party or another, delivering a majority in the electoral college.\n\nImage: Tim Walz during a campaign event in Minnesota in 2016. Pic: AP\n\nThis weekend Walz has set up his debate camp in Michigan. In between mock debates in which the Transport Secretary Pete Buttigieg is standing in for Vance, Walz will meet and greet the locals in the bayside resort of Harbor Springs. Conveniently there is a \"Festival of the Book\" taking place which will allow Walz to strut his stuff as a school teacher.\n\nVance has called up US representative Tom Emmer from Walz's home state for his prep. The House majority whip should know where his old foe's vulnerabilities lie.\n\nThis debate will not be relaxed. Unusually for a vice presidential encounter, the protagonists will not be sitting down, they will be standing at lecterns. The last time that happened was 2008 with Sarah Palin and Joe Biden.\n\nAs with the other debates this year, the Presidential Debates Commission has not been called upon to organise this one. The two sides agreed their own rules with the broadcaster. This time there will be no studio audience, once again, and two moderators: CBS presenters news anchor Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan of Meet The Press.\n\nAs Harris continues to challenge Trump to another debate without success, Vance has countered in advance demanding a second debate with Walz on 18 October. The Democrat is acting modest, protesting of Vance \"he's a Yale Law guy. I'm public school teacher\".\n\nImage: Pics: AP/Reuters\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free\n\nWalz hopes to play the part of a schoolmaster chiding a tearaway pupil. He will do well if he can emulate Lloyd Bentsen's crushing put down of the younger Dan Quayle in their 1988 vice presidential debate: \"I knew Jack Kennedy. You're no Jack Kennedy.\"\n\nWalz has fertile territory to exploit. JD Vance has already had to eat many of his wilder statements. He once likened his boss Trump to \"Hitler\". For electoral reasons he has U-turned on his book's thesis that his fellow poor whites were to blame for their own fecklessness.\n\nRepublican strategists hope that Vance will counter Walz's rebukes over sexism and abortion by sticking to mainstream issues such as inflation and immigration.\n\nVance can boast a nuanced personal record on some social issues including healthcare. But he is also pugnacious and may be unable to resist going after Walz aggressively for what Republicans regard as his left-wing voting record.\n\nTrump's groundless claims that Harris is \"a communist\" seem to be impressing Hispanic voters.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:29 Crowd chants 'we're not eating cats'\n\nWalz has more to lose and Vance has more to prove in the debate. Harris has embraced her choice of Walz, notably by appearing with him for her first major TV interview. Trump barely mentions Vance at his rallies. In opinion polls Walz has net approval ratings of 10%, Vance is at around minus 35%.\n\nDebates are proving their value in this election year. Americans are paying increasing attention to them. 51.3 million tuned in to Biden/Trump earlier in the summer, 67.1 million watched Harris/Trump earlier this month.\n\nFollow Sky News on WhatsApp Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky News Tap here\n\nAn outcome on Tuesday night as vivid as in the two previous debates this year could well be a defining moment for the next presidency.\n\nOn the other hand, both veteran Democrats and Republicans will also remember that while Lloyd Bentsen smashed the debate, George H W Bush and Dan Quayle won the election.",

        "text": "For vice presidential nominees and their debates, interest will likely exceed impact\nWith J.D. Vance and Tim Walz facing off Tuesday in a debate hosted by CBS News, many Americans may be wondering how much influence a vice presidential candidate has in a campaign that focuses on the presidential nominees.\n\nAhead of the televised matchup, Virginia Commonwealth University political analysts Amanda L. Wintersieck, Ph.D., associate professor in the Department of Political Science and director of the Institute for Democracy, Pluralism and Community Empowerment, and fellow associate professor John Aughenbaugh, Ph.D., offered insight into how or if the vice presidential debate could impact this election cycle.\n\nHow can a VP candidate help \u2013 or hurt \u2013 a presidential campaign?\n\nWintersieck said vice presidential candidates can help win strategic states and constituencies. She said for a VP to strategically matter in terms of the Electoral College, a presidential nominee would choose a running mate from a battleground state \u2013 though in this election, neither VP candidate fits this bill, with Vance serving as a senator from GOP-friendly Ohio and Walz serving as governor of Democrat-friendly Minnesota.\n\nVP candidates can also help by filling perceived gaps in expertise, as Joe Biden did for Barack Obama in 2008 on foreign policy, but that has more to do with altering perceptions of the presidential nominee.\n\nOn the other hand, Wintersieck said, a bad VP candidate can hurt a campaign, as Sarah Palin was perceived as doing in 2008 as GOP nominee John McCain\u2019s running mate.\n\nAughenbaugh noted that while media coverage may focus on how a VP pick may help or hurt a campaign in terms of optics, such as pairing a female vice presidential candidate with a male presidential nominee to attract female voters, research does not support this theory.\n\nBut research does suggest that an inexperienced presidential candidate might benefit from a VP choice who reassures voters that the potential president will have a seasoned politician to help them when faced with difficult situations.\n\n\u201cSome examples are George W. Bush picking Dick Cheney in 2000 when Bush had little experience beyond being Texas governor,\u201d Aughenbaugh said. \u201cOr John Kennedy picking Lyndon Johnson in 1960 when Kennedy was a U.S. senator with little governing experience.\u201d\n\nOverall, though, and citing research from the book \u201cDo Running Mates Matter? The Influence of Vice Presidential Candidates in Presidential Elections\u201d by Christopher J. Devine and Kyle C. Kopko, Aughenbaugh said VP candidates typically have little impact on the outcome of elections.\n\nDo VP debates influence voters?\n\nWintersieck said debates, even presidential ones, rarely matter. An exception is if a performance is viewed as particularly bad, such as Biden\u2019s debate with Donald Trump this year or Richard Nixon\u2019s performance when facing Kennedy in 1960. Another consideration could be a debate\u2019s timing, such as in the last three weeks of a campaign when voters might recall the matchup more clearly.\n\nAughenbaugh added that there is little to no research suggesting that VP debates, or even presidential ones, will greatly impact voters\u2019 choices or perceptions.\n\nWintersieck said media coverage of a debate, more than the candidates themselves, may leave an impression on voters \u2013 and \u201cdebates matter even less today because of the calcification of the electorate.\u201d",

        "text": "Donald Trump: A quick guide to the US president-elect\nClick to expand\n\nDonald Trump Republican Donald Trump, 78, is set to return to the White House after winning the 2024 presidential election against Kamala Harris. Here\u2019s all you need to know.\n\nDonald Trump won the 2024 US presidential election The Republican candidate received more than 270 electoral college votes, beating his rival Kamala Harris. He will be sworn in as president in January 2025 and serve four years in the Oval Office in his second term.\n\nHe stunned the world when he first won the presidency in 2016 Many didn\u2019t take Trump\u2019s first bid for president seriously - he was, after all, best known as a businessman and reality TV star. But, against all odds, he defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton, former US secretary of state and wife of former president Bill Clinton.\n\nHe introduced major change while in the White House Tightening immigration was a key campaign promise. He cracked down on travel from several Muslim-majority countries and strengthened part of the southern border. He made the top court in the US more conservative, withdrew the US from the Paris climate agreement and started a trade war with China.\n\nHe was an unconventional - and sometimes controversial - president Part of his appeal to voters was that he didn\u2019t speak or act like other politicians. And winning the White House the first time did not change that - he fired off tweets at all hours. His final months in office were dominated by one story - the Covid-19 pandemic. His critics say he heightened divisions over masks, lockdowns and vaccines.\n\nTrump lost in 2020 against Joe Biden but refused to accept defeat His first term in office ended with bitterness and violence when he made unfounded claims that he had lost the election unfairly. His supporters stormed the US Capitol after he gave a speech in the centre of Washington DC. The riot placed lawmakers and his own vice-president in danger.\n\nHis family were migrants from Germany and Scotland The fourth of five children, Trump was born in Queens, New York, in 1946 to Scottish mother Mary Anne MacLeod and Fred Trump, the son of German immigrants. His father was a real estate tycoon in New York and his son\u2019s inspiration. Donald joined the family business and became its president in 1971.\n\nHis name is on eye-catching buildings around the US In the 1980s, his business invested in several big real estate projects in New York, including Manhattan glass skyscraper, Trump Tower. As his real-estate empire grew, so did his celebrity status, helped by his 1987 book The Art of The Deal. In 1988, Forbes magazine estimated his net worth to be $1bn. But tax returns obtained by the New York Times showed Trump lost more than $1bn between 1985 and 1994, as businesses collapsed or were sold.\n\nHe's been down the aisle three times and has five children He had three children - Donald Jr, Ivanka and Eric - with his first wife Ivana. His second marriage to actress Marla Maples came two months after the birth of their daughter, Tiffany. Trump married Slovenian model Melania Knauss in 2005, his current wife and the former first lady. The couple have an 18-year-old son, Barron.\n\nThe Apprentice US made Trump a reality TV star Trump has made several on-screen cameo appearances, including in The Fresh Prince of Bel Air and Home Alone 2. However, The Apprentice - which he hosted from 2004 to 2015 - made Donald Trump a household name.\n\nTrump faces four separate criminal investigations In a New York trial, Trump was convicted of falsifying business records in a case about hush-money payments to silence a porn star before the 2016 election. Three other criminal trials - including two for his alleged attempt to overturn the 2020 election result - have been delayed until after this election.\n\nTrump survived two assassination attempts this year A gunman fired shots at him in Pennsylvania in July, one of the bullets grazing his right ear. One spectator was killed. Another apparent attempt on his life two months later was thwarted by Secret Service agents at Trump\u2019s Florida golf course. \u201cGod has now spared my life\u2026 not once, but twice,\u201d he told a rally in New York.",

        "text": "Leading US imams and scholars urge Muslim voters to snub Kamala Harris over Gaza\nA group of leading Muslim American scholars and imams have signed a letter calling on Muslim voters to spurn Democratic presidential candidate and Vice President Kamala Harris in the upcoming election over US support for Israel's war on Gaza.\n\nThe letter comes as polling within the Muslim American community shows a major departure from the Democratic Party over the Biden-Harris administration's unfettered support for Israel's war on Gaza, which they along with rights groups and legal experts view is a genocide against Palestinians.\n\n\"We may not know what the future holds, but we know this: we will not taint our hands by voting for or supporting an administration that has brought so much bloodshed upon our brothers and sisters,\" said the letter, released on Monday and seen by Middle East Eye.\n\nThe letter calls on Muslims to instead vote for any of the third-party candidates, including the Green Party's Jill Stein whose support has swelled among the Muslim American community in recent weeks.\n\n\"We want to be absolutely clear: don\u2019t stay home and skip voting. This year, make a statement by voting third party for the presidential ticket,\" the letter said.\n\nNew MEE newsletter: Jerusalem Dispatch Sign up to get the latest insights and analysis on Israel-Palestine, alongside Turkey Unpacked and other MEE newsletters\n\n\"Equally important, vote all the way down the ballot for candidates and policies that stand for truth and justice, ensuring your voice is heard at every level.\"\n\nThe letter, written and released in collaboration with the Abandon Harris campaign, was signed by more than three dozen religious leaders from all around the country, including Imam Dawud Walid, Dr Shadee Elmasry, Imam Omar Suleiman, Dr Yasir Qadhi, and Imam Tom Facchine.\n\nAn Appeal for Courage Letter by Umar Farooq\n\nIt comes after an umbrella group of major Muslim groups in the US released a similar call urging members to vote third-party, whether it be for Stein, Dr Cornel West, the Party for Socialism and Liberation's Claudia De la Cruz, or the Libertarian Party's Chase Oliver.\n\nWhile the last month has seen a surge in Muslim American support for third party candidates, there have also been groups urging Muslims to vote Democrat.\n\nThe Uncommitted Campaign, a movement that gained media attention for its call to withhold votes from President Biden during the primary elections over the war on Gaza, released a statement earlier this month saying that while it could not officially endorse Harris, voters should not cast their ballot for any other candidate but her.\n\nAnd Emgage, a Muslim American group that rose to prominence during the 2020 election, officially endorsed Harris last week.\n\nHudhayfah Ahmad, the communications director for Abandon Harris, said Monday's letter is a sign that groups supporting the Democratic Party are swimming against the tide of the majority of US Muslims.\n\n\u201cOver the past few weeks, we have seen several organisations claiming to represent the Muslim-American community either directly endorse the Harris-Walz ticket, as Emgage has done, or offer indirect support, like Uncommitted,\" Ahmad told Middle East Eye.\n\n\"This letter, signed by respected Muslim-American religious scholars, represents voices our community turns to for guidance in local mosques and at national Muslim conventions. It is a clear stance on where the overwhelming majority of the Muslim-American community stands: against genocide. And more signatures are on the way.\"\n\nState oppression operates 'beyond party lines'\n\nThe presidential election will take place on 5 November, and polls show the race between Harris and former President Donald Trump is tight.\n\nNational polls have Harris leading by several percentage points, while Trump is ahead in key battleground states such as Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\nWith the polls still not showing either candidate with a strong lead, and with the Democrats fearing a second Trump presidency, social media has been inundated with attacks against voters choosing not to vote for Harris, accusing them of paving the way for Trump\u2019s return to the Oval Office.\n\nThe imams who have signed the letter say the calls for Muslims to uncritically support Harris is fear-mongering.\n\n'It is about prioritising our faith and humanity, taking a stand for justice, and rejecting anyone who has supported, enacted, or promised to perpetuate such evil' - The letter from Muslim American scholars and imams\n\n\"None of this is an endorsement of Donald Trump's vile, racist agenda, which includes advancing the apartheid and genocidal interests of a foreign state while falsely claiming to put America first,\" the letter said.\n\n\"Rather, it is about prioritising our faith and humanity, taking a stand for justice, and rejecting anyone who has supported, enacted, or promised to perpetuate such evil.\"\n\nThe imams and scholars say they are \"fully aware\" of what would happen if Trump came into office. In his previous term, he enacted the \"Muslim ban\" and made major political and economic concessions to Israel, while also brokering agreements between Israel and the leaders of several Arab countries that sidelined Palestinians.\n\nIn the US, Trump drastically cut the number of refugees allowed in the country and endorsed the surveillance of the Muslim American community.\n\nIn their letter, the religious leaders say the Biden administration has done little to reverse many of these policies, going so far as to build on some of Trump's actions.\n\n\"However, we also recognise that the oppression of tens of millions within these borders is not limited to one political party - it is a systemic issue designed to repress those pushed to the margins,\" the letter said.\n\n\"From the violent suppression of anti-genocide encampments to the inhumane treatment of refugees and asylum seekers, and the state-sanctioned murder of Imam Marcellus Khalifah Williams, we understand that the oppressive hand of the state operates beyond party lines.\"\n\nA US-funded 'attack on the tenets of our faith'\n\nSince the beginning of the war on Gaza, after Hamas and other Palestinian groups launched a major attack on southern Israel that killed around 1,200 people, the administration of US President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris offered unequivocal support to Israel's bombing and later ground invasion of Gaza.\n\nThe US administration also shielded Israel from scrutiny at the United Nations, blocking several diplomatic attempts to put forth a call for a ceasefire.\n\nUS: Muslim groups urge voters to back Jill Stein, Cornel West or other pro-Palestine candidates Read More \u00bb\n\nThe administration has also publicly dismissed the case brought against Israel at the International Court of Justice and chastised the International Criminal Court\u2019s chief prosecutor\u2019s attempt to seek arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanayhu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant.\n\nMuslims in the United States looked at the footage of the war with horror, as Israeli forces bombed schools and UN shelters, and laid siege to hospitals. The current death toll is more than 41,000 Palestinians killed, though experts believe this is a severe underestimate.\n\nPalestine is an issue that tops the list of priorities for many Muslims, given the majority Muslim population in the occupied Palestinian territories and Gaza. Israeli forces have also attacked Christian Palestinians and bombed the oldest church still in use in Gaza.\n\nOccupied East Jerusalem is also home to Masjid al-Aqsa, the third-most revered site in Islam after the Kaaba in Mecca and Masjid an-Nabbawi in Medina.\n\nOn multiple occasions, Israeli soldiers also made a point of attacking the Islamic faith in their ground operations in Gaza and during their raids on the occupied West Bank.\n\n'Zionism is an existential threat to Muslims in America because it primarily relies on anti-Islamic tropes' - Imam Tom Facchine\n\nMore than 500 mosques in Gaza have been destroyed, and Israeli forces have killed around 300 Islamic scholars and sheikhs, including Quran instructors, Islamic preachers, and imams, the Palestinian Ministry of Religious Affairs said in May.\n\nIn December, footage showed Israeli soldiers sitting in a mosque in the West Bank city of Jenin, where they mocked the Muslim call to prayer. Another video in May showed an Israeli soldier burning copies of the Quran while standing inside the ruins of a mosque in Gaza.\n\n\"This isn't just another tragedy; it is a deliberate, calculated genocide and an attack on the very tenets of our faith, funded with our tax dollars and carried out with the full support and complicity of the Biden-Harris administration,\" the letter said.\n\nSignatories such as Imam Tom Facchine, resident scholar at the Utica Masjid in upstate New York, say they hope the high turnout against both Democrats and Republicans in the election will send a message that pro-Israel politics and Zionism, the ideology behind the creation of the state of Israel, are no longer issues that help politicians win elections.\n\n\"It's actually very simple. Zionism is an existential threat to Muslims in America because it primarily relies on anti-Islamic tropes and exploits the levers of power to criminalise and silence support for Palestine,\" Facchine told MEE.\n\n\"This election we will attach a political cost to supporting Zionism and the genocidal occupation or Palestine. From now on it will cost you your elected office to support the genocidal Zionist occupation. To politicians we say: be warned and plan accordingly.\"",

        "text": "What People in Prison Are Saying About the Presidential Election\nMost people would be surprised about how well-informed incarcerated people really are. For example, there are two topics that have been gaining a lot of momentum amongst the prison population: stocks and the presidential election. Just recently, a friend told me he has prepared two different stock portfolios, each tailored toward who is elected as the next president. It impressed me that he was aware of how a president\u2019s policy can affect the stock market. In the past 28 years, I\u2019ve heard a lot of things in prison, but his statement was a first for me. I asked him if he would vote when he returned home, and he said he would, just because he can.\n\nSince New York State recently passed legislation that allows formerly incarcerated people who were convicted of a felony to vote upon their release, half the people I speak to say they would take advantage of this. They finally feel like they are part of a bigger picture and are no longer silenced.\n\nKeeping up with the presidential election for most people here in prison began as a form of entertainment. After a while, they began to speak about what they agreed with and what they didn\u2019t. These types of conversations are new in prison. But, as with everything else, egos and opinions will always lead to arguments amongst the incarcerated\u2014and even with staff. The effect? Division . . . imagine that! The same effect that politics has had within our society has now found its way inside prisons. Regardless of that fact, some people continue to proudly express their opinions while others remain silent. Even watching certain news networks can label you, so most people watch television in silence with their headphones plugged in. Others play their TVs loudly, welcoming a debate and the opportunity to pass some time.\n\nAfter conducting a survey with the men in my cell block, the prison population is split roughly in half: those who care about the presidential election and those who do not. The group who doesn\u2019t care is made up of the younger men, who are mostly in their 20s. Why? They feel disconnected, and most men that age are usually influenced by what their peers are doing or not doing. They also feel that politicians cannot truly relate to their past and current struggles. These people state that they have no plans on voting once released. They may watch the debates, but only for entertainment purposes or to witness a momentous moment.\n\nI recall a man yelling out to everyone on the gallery, \u201cThe debate is on!\u201d And, in a split second, it became quiet. I couldn\u2019t believe it\u2014silence in a prison often consumed with chaos! However, this didn\u2019t last long. All it took was one person to voice his opinion and the gallery became a contest of who can scream the loudest. These moments always bring a laugh, especially when one man said, \u201cYelling doesn't make you right!\u201d\n\nAlthough we are physically isolated from society, these cells, bars, walls, and barbed wire do not shield us from information on the politics or social issues that plague our communities. Mental health issues thrive amongst us; as do addiction, poverty, inflation, and broken families . . . all of it finds its way into the system.\n\nPeople in prison are also looking for solutions and maybe\u2014just maybe\u2014they show an interest in the presidential election as a silent cry for help.\n\nDavid Sell is a husband, grandfather, writer, hospice volunteer, and advocate for prison reform.

        "text": "Young voters: Driven or disillusioned?\nFor young people preparing to vote in their first presidential election, the 2024 contest is undoubtedly shaping up to be a memorable one.\n\nOn one side: a candidate convicted of felonies who survived two apparent assassination attempts on the campaign trail. On the other: a candidate who stepped in to replace the incumbent midrace.\n\nOnce upon a time, this might have sounded like the stuff of political fiction, but the attention-grabbing headlines in this year's election cycle may, for better or worse, be feeling more like the norm to the American people, especially for the nation's youngest voters, who came of age at a time marked by several unprecedented events in politics, says University of Arizona political scientist Frank Gonzalez.\n\nImage Frank Gonzalez\n\nThings that seasoned voters considered outrageous in 2016 don't carry the same weight with new voters. \"Young voters have grown up in a world where that's just politics,\" said Gonzalez, an associate professor in the in the School of Government and Public Policy in the U of A College of Social and Behavioral Sciences. \"Voters who are voting for the first time this election were young teens in 2020, so their first exposure to American elections was in 2020 with the candidate who lost saying the election was rigged and stolen.\"\n\nIt remains to be seen if and how the twists and turns of this year's presidential race will affect turnout among young voters \u2013 a demographic that presidential candidates throughout history have fought to win over but who tend to turn out in low numbers on Election Day, Gonzalez said.\n\nAs former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris clash on several issues of critical importance to the American people \u2013 including reproductive rights, immigration and the economy \u2013 some young voters might be feeling especially motivated to cast their votes, while others may be feeling more disillusioned, he said.\n\n\"There's a lot of disillusionment with the political process. You see it on both sides, and it's especially high among young voters,\" Gonzalez said. \"The most active sides of each party are wanting to question the system as a whole. You have arguments on both sides that somehow the system itself is illegitimate.\"\n\nOn the right, for example, there were those who denied the legitimacy of the 2020 election, while on the left, at the height of the Black Lives Matter movement, there were those who questioned whether electoral politics are the best way to enact change, Gonzalez said.\n\nThe Gen Z gender gap\n\nDespite potential disillusionment, more than 50% of registered voters between the ages of 18 and 29 voted in the 2020 race between Donald Trump and Joe Biden \u2013 a higher number than in 2008, when Barack Obama was elected and became the first Black U.S. president, according to the U.S Elections Project. It was only the second presidential election in which some members of Generation Z \u2013 which includes those born between 1997 to 2012 \u2013 were old enough to vote.\n\nUsually, Gonzaelz said, high turnout by young voters \u2013 who are generally more likely to lean liberal \u2013 is a good thing for Democrats, as it was in 2020.\n\nBut young voters aren't a monolith, and there's no guarantee they will vote the Democratic ticket. Recent polls, including the Harvard Youth Poll and a recent report from the Gallup organization, suggest there are notable gender differences in young people's political leanings, with women ages 18-29 growing increasingly liberal in recent years while a growing number of young men have disassociated from the Democratic party or \"liberal\" label. The Harvard poll found that male and female voters under 30 are both more likely to support Harris overall, but female support outpaces male support 70% to 53%.\n\nThe reason for the gender gap hasn't been fully explained, but Gonzalez suspects it's connected to a growing preference among young males \u2013 in the years since Trump entered the political sphere \u2013 for more authoritarian qualities, such as \"strength\" and \"power,\" in a presidential candidate.\n\n\"Authoritarianism is about prioritizing strength and dominance and power and hierarchy and deference to authority,\" Gonzalez said. \"Those things also go hand in hand with hyper-masculinity, and a preference for strength and dominance is one of strongest predictors of whether you support Donald Trump.\"\n\nWill Swifties have sway?\n\nAnother surprise in this year's election cycle could be the new power of celebrity endorsements. Generally, political scientists have found that such endorsements have little measurable impact on a race, Gonzalez said.\n\nBut that could be changing, particularly among younger people. In the 24 hours after singer-songwriter Taylor Swift threw her support behind Harris and urged her fans to register to vote, 405,999 people visited the website vote.gov, a voting information site run by the U.S. General Services Administration in collaboration with the U.S. Election Assistance Commission. The site typically has about 30,000 visitors a day.\n\n\"In political science, the go-to explanation has been that endorsements don't matter that much,\" Gonzalez said. \"Regardless of whether they're celebrity or union or industry, we've looked time and time again and it seems like it doesn't really shift elections. But this year seems different. We have billionaires who have an incredible amount of influence \u2013 Taylor Swift on the left and Elon Musk on the right \u2013 so it's hard to think that this has not changed what we thought we knew about how endorsements matter.\"\n\nGetting out the college vote\n\nAdriana Grijalva, University of Arizona student body president and a junior majoring in political science, will be voting in her first presidential election this year.\n\nShe believes the unprecedented nature of this year's race has motivated her peers to vote.\n\n\"I've never seen an election like this, and I've never seen this much engagement, especially from young voters,\" she said. \"Students get that their vote matters, and that it matters more than ever to be inspired to vote.\"\n\nImage Adriana Grijalva\n\nAs president of the Associated Students of the University of Arizona, Grijalva has made it her mission to get her fellow students registered to vote and to the polls on Election Day.\n\nShe chairs the university's Nonpartisan Civic Engagement Committee, which launched the Wildcats Take Action: Your Voice, Your Impact campaign to encourage voter registration and participation among students.\n\nThe campaign is reaching out to students through social media, direct messaging, information tables on the U of A Mall and special events, including a series of workshops intended to educate young voters about how to register, where to vote and what's on the ballot. The deadline to register to vote in Arizona is Oct. 7.\n\n\"The inspiration for creating the Nonpartisan Civic Engagement Committee on campus came from a desire to support students through this election season, so they feel informed and have the resources and are empowered by participating in voting,\" said Grijalva, who is 20.\n\nGrijalva hopes to run for Congress when she turns 25, following in the footsteps of her uncle Raul Grijalva, a Democrat who since 2003 has represented Arizona in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nFor now, her goal is to increase the percentage of U of A students voting in the presidential election. In the 2020 election, 60.5% of U of A students voted, according to the National Study of Learning, Voting and Engagement, a study of college and university student voting conducted by Tufts University. Grijalva would like to see that number top 63% this year and 70% in the future.\n\nThe U of A will host early voting in the Student Union Memorial Center's Santa Cruz room on Oct. 28-31 from 8 a.m.-5 p.m. and Nov. 1 from 8 a.m.-7 p.m. Additional information is available on the ASUA Bear Down & Vote page.",

        "text": "J.D. Vance, Tim Walz clash on immigration, abortion, democracy in U.S. vice-presidential debate\nOhio Sen. J.D. Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz confronted one another for the first time Tuesday in a policy-heavy vice-presidential debate, wrangling key issues from abortion to immigration and gun violence while defending their running mates' records in office.\n\nThe debate between Vance, 40, and Walz, 60, struck a far more cordial tone than last month's meeting between Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.\n\nThe vice-presidential candidates, who shook hands before and after the event, focused almost exclusively on minute policy standpoints and avoided targeted personal attacks toward one another \u2014 and, as was largely the point of the evening, avoiding any viral missteps that could hurt the presidential hopefuls.\n\nThe sharpest moment of the debate came at its close, when Vance dodged a pointed question from Walz during a final exchange about American democracy.\n\n\"He is still saying [Trump] didn't lose the election,\" Walz said, before turning to Vance. \"Did he lose the 2020 election?\"\n\n\"I am focused on the future,\" Vance responded, before accusing Harris of censoring opposing online views.\n\n\"That is a damning non-answer,\" Walz said.\n\nWATCH | Walz questions Vance on 2020 election results: Walz calls out Vance\u2019s \u2018damning non-answer\u2019 on Trump\u2019s 2020 election loss Duration 0:24 During the CBS News Vice-Presidential Debate on Tuesday, , when Democratic vice-presidential nominee Tim Walz asked his Republican counterpart J.D. Vance if Donald Trump lost the 2020 presidential election, Vance said he is \u2018focused on the future\u2019 \u2014 which drew a rebuke from Walz.\n\nChris Cillizza, a political commentator and former CNN editor-at-large, said the moment was Walz's strongest after a shakier start onstage. He said Vance was confident from the outset and clearly tried to defend \"some things that Donald Trump has said and done that are, frankly, indefensible.\"\n\nAs with past vice-presidential debates, Cillizza said he didn't think the night was likely to affect the outcome of next month's election.\n\n\"Not significantly, no,\" he told CBC's The National, before adding: \"Do I think J.D. Vance did himself a major solid in terms of what he looks like going forward? Yes.\"\n\nWATCH | Breaking down the biggest moments of the debate: Breaking down the biggest moments in the vice-presidential debate Duration 12:03 The National asks U.S. political analysts Tia Mitchell, Chris Cillizza and CBC News correspondent Katie Simpson to break down key moments from the U.S. vice-presidential debate between Tim Walz and J.D. Vance and how it could impact the presidential race.\n\nWalz, an affable former high school teacher and football coach, and Vance, the conservative firebrand whose Hillbilly Elegy memoir became a Hollywood film, have both painted themselves as two family-first men with humble American Midwest roots.\n\nThey argued Tuesday over the Middle East crisis, immigration, abortion, climate change and the economy. CBS News hosted the 90-minute event from its New York City broadcast centre, with CBS Evening News anchor Norah O'Donnell and Face the Nation host Margaret Brennan serving as moderators.\n\nIn contrast to the debate between Trump and Harris, the potential vice presidents at times thanked each other on Tuesday and conceded they might even agree on finer policy theories. Despite having gone after one another's character on the campaign trail, they saved personal jabs for the presidential nominees.\n\nVance and Walz lingered on stage after the debate, shaking hands again meeting each other's wives before thanking the two debate moderators.\n\nPolitical scientists have noted the majority of U.S. voters typically don't cast their ballot based on the potential vice-president . In recent campaigns, vice-presidents are typically used to rally the party's voter base and shore up support for the presidential candidate.\n\nBut vice-presidential hopefuls are not insignificant: Vance or Walz would have the constitutional duty to step up and lead the United States in the event the president was unable to perform their duties.\n\nOn Tuesday, the longest exchanges came on the topics of immigration and abortion \u2014 the former being a strong campaign issue for Republicans and the latter for Democrats.\n\nWATCH | Walz and Vance discuss access to abortion in America: Letting states decide abortion rules puts American lives in danger, Walz says Duration 1:41 During the CBS News Vice-Presidential Debate on Tuesday, Democratic nominee Tim Walz countered Republican nominee J.D. Vance\u2019s comment that states should make their own decisions about abortion by referring to the case of a Georgia woman who died while trying to access a legal procedure out of state. 'There's a very real chance, had Amber Thurman lived in Minnesota, she would be alive,' Walz said.\n\nOn immigration, moderators asked Vance if a second Trump administration would separate children from their migrant parents, even if those children were U.S. citizens.\n\nVance did not answer the question directly and dodged it again when moderators came back to him.\n\nAt another point, Vance said 15,000 Haitians in the city of Springfield, Ohio, were contributing to problems with housing, the economy and other issues he said the Biden-Harris administration had ignored.\n\nWhen debate moderators noted Haitians in the city had legal status, Vance objected and said he understood CBS moderators would not be fact-checking during the debate.\n\nAfter Vance continued despite the moderators' attempts to move on, his microphone was cut off and neither man could be heard.\n\nWATCH | 'Gentlemen, the audience can't hear you because your mics are cut': \u2018Thank you for explaining the legal process\u2019: Debate moderators mute Vance\u2019s mic Duration 0:45 While discussing immigration during the CBS News Vice-Presidential Debate on Tuesday, Republican nominee J.D. Vance saw his audio cut off by moderators Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan.\n\nThroughout the debate, Vance sought to defend Trump's presidential record and questioned why Harris had not done more to address inflation, immigration and the economy since taking office with President Joe Biden in 2021.\n\n\"If Kamala Harris has such great plans for how to address middle-class problems, then she ought to do them now \u2014 not when asking for [a] promotion, but in the job the American people gave her three-and-a-half years ago,\" Vance said.\n\nComing to Harris's defence, Walz described Trump as an unstable leader who sank a congressional bill aimed at slowing illegal immigration because he saw it as \"a campaign issue.\"\n\n\"We all want to solve this,\" Walz said of the border issue, before adding, \"Well, most of us.\"\n\nThe Democrat found some of his strongest footing of the night on the issue of abortion. In his responses, he spoke about women who've faced grave health consequences trying to navigate strict abortion laws in states like Texas, Kentucky and Georgia since Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022.\n\nHe criticized Trump for having praised the repeal of the landmark decision, which had guaranteed Americans' right to an abortion for nearly half a century.\n\n\"Things worked best when Roe vs. Wade was in place,\" Walz said.\n\nWATCH | Walz and Vance discuss access to abortion in America: The Current 19:39 Walz and Vance trade barbs \u2014 politely U.S. vice-presidential candidates J.D. Vance and Tim Walz had a civilized and at times even cordial debate Tuesday, in stark contrast to when Donald Trump faced off against Kamala Harris last month. What does the debate tell us about the remaining month of this campaign?\n\nVance, who has previously held a much more conservative stance on reproductive rights, acknowledged his past anti-abortion statements have been problematic for voters. Striking a more moderate tone than usual, he added many Americans have lost faith in Republicans when it comes to the issue.\n\n\"We've got to do a much better a job at earning Americans' trust back,\" he said.\n\nBoth candidates were also questioned about past remarks they'd made.\n\nWalz was asked about having claimed he was in Hong Kong during the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, when he in fact did not arrive until afterward. He said he \"misspoke\" and \"got there that summer.\"\n\n\"I'm a knucklehead at times,\" Walz said. \"I will talk a lot. I will get caught up in the rhetoric.\"\n\nLISTEN | National Review reporter, Democratic consultant on the debate:\n\nSimilarly, Vance backtracked on his previous criticism of Trump \u2014 including a past comment that Trump could be \"America's Hitler.\"\n\n\"I was wrong about Donald Trump,\" Vance said Tuesday. \"I was wrong, first of all, because I believe some of the media stories that turned out to be dishonest fabrications of his record. But most importantly, Donald Trump delivered for the American people.\"\n\nThe night's tone was a marked change in a campaign characterized by inflammatory rhetoric, two assassination attempts and personal attacks between presidential candidates. Trump has repeatedly attacked Harris's race and gender, while escaping attempts on his life in July and September.\n\nVance, 40, and Walz, 60, shook hands before the debate began. (Julia Demaree Nikhinson/The Associated Press)\n\nWalz has described his Republican opponents as \"weird,\" while Vance faced criticism for referring to some Democrats as \"childless cat ladies.\"\n\nEarly voting is underway in nearly two dozen states with 35 days left until election day. While Harris has edged ahead in national polls, most surveys show voters remain fairly evenly divided in the seven states that will decide the outcome on Nov. 5.",

        "text": "Will the 2024 presidential election affect the stock market?\nDavid S. Gilreath, CFP\n\nEvery presidential election year, there\u2019s an unrelenting media focus on how the outcome will affect the stock market.\n\nIt never fails. In one article after another, financial journalists inflict on their audiences unrestrained speculation about how the stock market may fare as a result of one political party winning the White House versus the other.\n\nThese commentaries never suggest that the election outcome may not make much difference, as they follow a hallowed journalistic axiom: Never discount the thesis (or assumption) driving a story because, of course, that story must be done, regardless of how shaky its basis may be.\n\nAn old adage\n\nAn old newspaper adage comes to mind \u2014 one that\u2019s common in screenplays of newspaper movies from the 1930s and 1940s: \u201cNever let the facts get in the way of a good story.\u201d\n\nIn this case, the inconvenient fact that gets in the way is that it historically hasn\u2019t really mattered for the market which party wins the presidency. This has been true for the better part of a century.\n\nDuring presidential administrations since Eisenhower, the mean compound annual growth rate of the S&P 500 index of large company stocks has been 9.6% for Democratic presidents and 6.2% for Republicans. But the median growth rate has averaged 8.5% during Democratic administrations and 10.2% for Republicans.\n\nSo media speculation over how a presidential victory by either party would make a real difference in the market during their administrations is much ado about nothing, with a quadrennial din of political noise combined with market noise.\n\nInvestors are always better off ignoring noise (in favor of data) when managing long-term portfolios, and political noise is no exception.\n\nBuying opportunity\n\nHowever, investors interested in adding to stock positions at discounted prices may not want to ignore the fact that an election is about to be held, as this alone usually has a significant impact on short-term market performance. Recurring election-season market patterns often create buying opportunities.\n\nElection years are highly volatile for the market, and heightened volatility in the autumn of those years is almost as predictable as leaves changing color.\n\nOn average, in presidential election years from 1928 to 2024, the S&P 500 has risen several percentage points in the summer before declining in the fall \u2014 for losses in September and October: -0.3% and -0.5%, respectively. Over the last 10 years, the dip has averaged 2.31%.\n\nOnce elections are over, this index has usually headed upward again, gaining an average of 1.2% in November and 1.5% in December. And it usually continues heading upward in January.\n\nSo cashing out of the market in the fall is usually a losing strategy, while buying (low) post-election can often position investors for solid gains the following year \u2014 especially amid a bull market like the current one.\n\nIn many past election years, the early fall dip started in September, but that hasn\u2019t turned out to be the case this year, as the market was that month. Yet, if past pre-election autumn averages manifest again, a pre-election decline would likely occur in October \u2014 before bouncing upward in November.\n\nAfter the cloud lifts\n\nThe timing of this historically average post-election bounce may seem like a head-scratcher, as it\u2019s usually unclear before presidents take office precisely what policies may be forthcoming, campaign promises being what they are.\n\nYet, while this specific uncertainty may linger, general uncertainty over the election outcome is over after the votes are counted.\n\nSo normal trading resumes, pushing up markets already inclined to rise from longer-term factors.\n\nYet there\u2019s a caveat \u2014 one that concerns an atmospheric effect that can slow the clearing of the cloud of market-suppressing uncertainty.\n\nThe market historically hasn\u2019t liked sweeps \u2014 when one party takes the White House and both chambers of Congress. It prefers divided government because this creates a likelihood that little will get done and that things won\u2019t change much, meaning less uncertainty.\n\nWhen one party sweeps the election, uncertainty rises because it means a lot of bills can be passed and signed by the president, potentially affecting stocks.\n\nBut, as no polls currently suggest a likely sweep November 5, continued divided government seems probable.\n\nOnce the election uncertainty cloud clears, long-term factors driving the market can resume their influence unimpeded. This time around, these factors are the forces driving the remarkably strong bull market.\n\nFinancials and tech\n\nIn recent decades, some sectors have done much better the year after elections than others. The standouts are financials, with post-election-year returns averaging 23% (up from 12.4% in election years), and technology, averaging a gain of 23.6% (up from 7.2%).\n\nThis year, these two sectors already have momentum. As of mid-September, year-to-date gains for both technology and financials exceeded 20%.\n\nAnd after the 2024 election, historically likely post-election gains for the overall market will probably be enhanced by some new bullish factors.\n\nBullish Factors\n\nOne of these stems from the persistent bearish obsession with recession, which has recently been rearing its paranoid head once again. This talk tends to have a downward effect on prices, and this suppression can set up bigger gains from election-season lows after a recession fails to materialize.\n\nOverwhelmingly, data shows that these obsessive bears are, as presidential speechwriter William Safire famously wrote for Spiro Agnew, just nattering nabobs of negativism.\n\nLeading economists see no reason to suspect that a recession may be on the horizon. Nor does Fed Chair Jay Powell, who said as much Sept. 18 in announcing Federal Reserve\u2019s .50% cut in the Federal funds rate, which triggers declines in virtually all domestic interest rates.\n\nThe Fed cut, the first of a few expected this year with more to come in 2025, is aimed at winding down the Fed\u2019s restrictive rate policy. It marks the beginning of what will likely be a long rate-cutting cycle, following a sustained period of elevated rates, originally raised by the Fed to reduce inflation.\n\nStimulative for the economy, rate cuts usually benefit stocks in general for months to come, especially those in certain sectors \u2014 financials and technology among them.\n\nAnother bullish factor is the prospect of new investment adding power to the bull. The beginning of the Fed rate-cutting cycle means that interest rates paid on money market accounts will go down seemingly as fast as car windows.\n\nAs a result, the more than $6 trillion currently held in these accounts will naturally start flowing into higher-yielding investments \u2014 including stocks, as yields on new bond issues also decline. This infusion of cash into the market next year will probably push up stock prices.\n\nIf the election autumn decline occurs again and hits a trough around election day, as usual, this would be a likely take-off point for the market on the runway to substantial gains in 2025 \u2014 especially for investors who buy this dip judiciously.\n\nDave S.

        "text": "The politics of the port strike\nThe ramifications of the US dockworkers strike that began Tuesday could inject uncertainty into the 2024 presidential campaign, create a new sense of unease around the US economy, and be directly felt in key swing states from Georgia to Michigan.\n\nMuch of the unease hinges on how much \u2014 and how long \u2014 any effects will be felt now that port workers on the East and Gulf coasts have walked out.\n\n\"If it lasts for more than a few days or more than a week, you're going to get massive cascading effects,\" Flexport founder and CEO Ryan Petersen said in a recent Yahoo Finance appearance, noting that 15% of the world's container ships could be caught up in a stoppage.\n\n\"That's a huge reduction in capacity,\" he added.\n\nBut a prolonged shutdown in Georgia, North Carolina, and in other major ports in the East and Gulf coasts could increase Americans\u2019 sense of economic unease after negotiations stalled over a complex series of wages and automation issues.\n\nThere are also significant question marks about how Kamala Harris and Donald Trump will approach the strike \u2014 with much of the campaign trail focus in recent days on other topics such as the aftermath of Hurricane Helene. The back-and-forth plays into complex politics around unions in the 2024 race amid a concerted effort by Donald Trump to gain labor support.\n\nRead more: What the 2024 campaign means for your wallet: The Yahoo Finance guide to the presidential election\n\nEconomic problems could also quickly spread to other parts of the country that will also have a say in the November election, like Michigan, if shipments of autos and auto parts are held up.\n\nBut shipping experts said that President Joe Biden could be drawn directly into the standoff and be forced to step in to keep workers temporarily on the job.\n\n\"We strongly suspect that, this close to the election and despite denials ahead of time, President Biden would have little choice but to step in and invoke back-to-work legislation,\" Bradley Saunders of Capital Economics wrote in a recent note.\n\nSuch a move could trigger an 80-day \"cooling off period\" and largely \u2014 but not completely \u2014 shelve the issue until after Election Day.\n\nThe White House said such a move isn't on the table, but it is increasingly being drawn into the standoff.\n\nLast Friday, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Acting Labor Secretary Julie Su, and Director of the National Economic Council Lael Brainard met with the port operator, the United States Maritime Alliance, to convey a message \"that they need to be at the table and negotiating in good faith fairly and quickly.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nThat same message had been delivered to the union, a White House official added.

Perhaps the key question at the moment \u2014 outside of what happens next between the International Longshoremen's Association and the United States Maritime Alliance \u2014 is what role the Biden-Harris administration will ultimately play. The White House has taken a wait-and-see approach in recent weeks but has maintained that exercising executive power to delay the strike is not on the table; \"We\u2019ve never invoked Taft-Hartley to break a strike and are not considering doing so now,\" a White House official said on Friday, in a reference to a 1947 law that gave the US government more power to intervene in labor disputes. Changing course is an option that would risk angering union leaders, but multiple experts say the White House could quickly have little choice.

(ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images) \u00b7 ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS via Getty Images \"My base case would be we would get a couple of days in, and I find it difficult to believe that the Biden administration will not invoke the Taft-Hartley Act,\" added Michigan State University supply chain management professor Jason Miller in a recent Yahoo Finance interview. But even if the workers are forced back onto a job without a deal, there is no guarantee that things will operate smoothly in that 80-day interim. \"We would expect some slowdowns over that period,\" Miller added. Cascading economic effects Ports from Massachusetts to Texas could be impacted by the strike, but the most in focus politically are those in Savannah, Ga., and Wilmington, N.C., that move significant cargo and sit in key swing states. Smaller ports in Brunswick, Ga., as well as Morehead City, N.C., could also be impacted and are already drawing up contingency plans. Tobin Marcus of Wolfe Research listed the strike as a possible \"October surprise\" in a recent note to clients, adding that it \"could become a major problem for Harris if it drags out.\" But so far, it has largely yet to break through on the campaign trail, even with candidates regularly traveling close to these ports. Donald Trump traveled to Savannah last week; he commented on the city's port but didn't weigh in on the labor unrest. \"With a world-class port and a world-class workforce, this city will soon become one of the premier export hubs anywhere on earth,\" Trump said as part of his manufacturing pitch.

(Brandon Bell/Getty Images) \u00b7 Brandon Bell via Getty Images Likewise, the Harris campaign and national Democrats have said little about the strike so far. But that could change quickly if disruptions are seen and as Democrats try to convince voters they will be good stewards of the economy. The Oct. 1 start of the strike also has auspicious timing, coming the same day as a vice presidential debate. Another wild card is an ongoing battle for union votes between Harris and Trump, with the former president making a concerted pitch to union workers and leaders to cut into the traditional Democratic strength. Harold Daggett, the head of the dockworkers union in the middle of the current talks, has also gotten notice for his aggressive tactics as well as his willingness to invoke politics directly. \"Where's the president of the United States? He not fighting for us,\" Daggett said in a recent video. He added of his negotiations with the port operators: \"I'll shut them down to prove that we can beat them.\" This post has been updated.

        "text": "David Leonhardt on the U.S. presidential election\nWith just weeks remaining until the U.S. presidential election, Americans can expect around-the-clock coverage of campaign rallies, endless TV advertisements, and see-sawing poll numbers.\n\nNew York Times senior writer David Leonhardt has some advice: \u201cembrace the horserace.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s essentially 50-50 right now,\u201d he said at a recent event previewing the election hosted by the Jackson School of Global Affairs. \u201cMy mind changes by the week as to who I think will win.\u201d Leonhardt, a Senior Fellow at the Jackson School, was joined in conversation by Jim Levinsohn, dean.\n\nLeonhardt\u2014the lead writer of The New York Times\u2019 daily newsletter, The Morning\u2014talked about how the Times has ramped up its election coverage in recent months, introducing a new series called \u201cThe Stakes,\u201d which dives deep into key issues that are likely to decide the election and where the candidates stand on them.\n\nThe Stakes, Leonhardt explained, has been a key part of the Times\u2019 effort to differentiate the two candidates for undecided voters. But with such disparate candidates, Levinsohn wondered how there could be any undecided voters at this point in the race.\n\n\u201cI think people who are undecided don\u2019t like Donald Trump [as a person] \u2014 but they also don\u2019t like what has happened over the last four years,\u201d Leonhardt answered.\n\nReflecting on results of a recent informal survey of Times readers, Leonhardt said there are concerns that Trump is \u201cerratic,\u201d \u201cunhinged,\u201d and \u201cselfish\u201d but that the economy \u201cwent well enough\u201d during his presidency. Kamala Harris, on the other hand, worries readers when it comes to inflation and immigration \u2014 and many still don\u2019t have a good understanding of her policy positions due to her truncated campaign.\n\nWhen asked how the Times balances its critical coverage of the two candidates, Leonhardt was candid about the challenges that journalists face.\n\n\u201cTrump is hard to cover, he\u2019s like nobody else in politics,\u201d said Leonhardt. \u201cI know that at The Times, we are not covering them equally because what Trump is doing is unprecedented. But we also can\u2019t just say bad things about Trump and good things about Harris \u2014 that\u2019s not the role of a free press.\u201d",

        "text": "Who won the Vance-Walz vice-presidential debate?\nVance and Walz stick to policy in polite VP debate - but who won?\n\nWatch key moments from the US vice-presidential debate\n\nTuesday night\u2019s vice-presidential debate between Republican JD Vance and Democrat Tim Walz felt like a civil and relatively restrained conversation about the issues at the top of American voters' minds going into the 5 November election. In that, it was unlike the two presidential debates earlier this year. The two men spent much more time attacking the other's running mate than each other during 90-plus minutes on the CBS News stage in New York. Walz had a shaky start but hit his stride when talking about abortion and the Capitol riot. But the even-tempered, policy-focused debate, with few political body blows, probably served Vance - a polished public speaker - best in the end. If Vance was picked because he puts ideological meat on the bones of Trump\u2019s conservative populism, on Tuesday night he put a polite, humble face on them, as well. \u201cSomething these guys do is they make a lot of claims about if Donald Trump becomes president, all of these terrible consequences are going to ensue,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in reality, Donald Trump was president. Inflation was low. Take-home pay was higher.\"\n\nThere were moments when the Republican candidate bristled at what he thought was unfair fact-checking from the two CBS moderators, and at one point microphones of both candidates were temporarily muted. But for the most part, the exchanges on stage were even-tempered. And there were several moments when the two men agreed on issues \u2013 and said so. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of commonality here,\u201d Walz said toward the end of the evening. When Walz spoke of his 17-year-old son witnessing a shooting at a community center, Vance seemed genuinely concerned. \u201cI'm sorry about that and I hope he's doing OK,\u201d he said. \u201cChrist have mercy, it is awful.\"\n\nWatch: Mics muted after host fact-checks Vance on Springfield migrants\n\nCordial - but with a few clashes\n\nThe most vigorous disagreements came toward the end of the debate, on the topic of Trump\u2019s repeated and false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him. Vance, when asked if Trump lost the last presidential election, dodged the question and criticised what he said was Kamala Harris\u2019s censorship. Walz quickly noted that it was a \u201cdamning non-answer\u201d. \u201cTo deny what happened on January 6, the first time an American president or anyone tried to overturn an election, this has got to stop,\" he said. \u201cIt\u2019s tearing our country apart.\u201d Walz went on to say that the only reason Mike Pence, Trump\u2019s previous vice-president, was not on stage was because he certified President Joe Biden\u2019s victory. Vance had no answer to that, highlighting that beyond his friendly demeanour and agreeability, he would not break from Trump\u2019s position.\n\nThe BBC's Anthony Zurcher on the VP debate's biggest takeaways\n\nTwo different styles\n\nVance and Walz entered this debate with different skill sets. Vance has sparred with journalists on television in heated exchanges. Walz is at home on the campaign stump, using his folksy style in contrast to more polished politicians. In the early part of this debate, with both candidates standing behind podiums in a New York City television studio, Vance seemed much more comfortable. His answers were smooth, and relentlessly on-message, constantly reminding the audience that for all of Vice-President Harris\u2019s promises, Democrats have held the White House for the past three and a half years. \u201cIf Kamala Harris has such great plans for how to address middle class problems, then she ought to do them now,\u201d he said. Walz, for his part, seemed halting and unsure on the opening topic, dealing with Tuesday\u2019s Iranian missile attack on Israel and if the candidates would support an Israeli pre-emptive strike on Iran. The Minnesota governor rarely talks about foreign policy, and his discomfort on the subject was apparent. A quick guide to JD Vance\n\nA quick guide to Tim Walz The Democrat settled in as the debate moved along, and during his exchanges with Vance on the topic of immigration - an area of strength for the Republicans - both delivered well-honed messages. Vance deflected accusations that he amplified false claims about Haitian immigrants stealing and eating pets in Ohio. \u201cThe people I'm most worried about in Springfield, Ohio, are the American citizens who have had their lives ruined by Kamala Harris's border policies,\u201d he said. Vance said undocumented migration burdens city resources, drives up prices and pushes down wages. Walz pointed to Trump\u2019s opposition to proposed bipartisan immigration legislation earlier this year. \u201cI believe Senator Vance wants to solve this, but by standing with Donald Trump and not working together to find a solution, it becomes a talking point, and when it becomes a talking point like this, we dehumanise and villainise other human beings.\u201d\n\nWhen the topic turned to abortion rights \u2013 an area of strength for Democrats, according to polls \u2013 it was Vance who played defence, acknowledging that Republicans had to do more to earn the trust of American voters. \"I want us as a Republican Party to be pro-family in the fullest sense of the word,\u201d he said. \u201cI want us to make it easier for moms to afford to have babies. There\u2019s so much we can do on the public policy front just to give women more options.\u201d Walz countered by saying that the Democratic view on abortion was simple: \u201cWe are pro-women. We are pro-freedom to make your own choice.\u201d If Walz was more pointed on abortion, he declined to push his attacks when the subject turned to gun control. After Vance said that it was important to increase security in schools, making doors and windows \u201cstronger\u201d, Walz talked up background checks rather than endorsing Democratic calls for bans on assault weapons and other limitations on firearms. As a congressman, Walz regularly voted in favour of gun rights and against many gun control measures, winning the praise of the pro-gun National Rifle Association. During the debate, he said his views on gun control changed after the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting, but some Democrats may be disappointed he did not press Vance more on Tuesday night.\n\nWe ask college students: who do you think won the debate?\n\nWill this impact the race?\n\nAmerican political history suggests that vice-presidential debates don\u2019t really matter. In 1988, Democrat Lloyd Bentsen dismantled Republican Dan Quayle. A few months later, Quayle was sworn in as vice-president after his ticket won in a landslide. It may turn out that this debate is similarly irrelevant to November\u2019s results. Unless there is a last-minute debate announced, however, it will be the last word both parties have on a debate stage before election day. Walz did no harm to the Democratic ticket and showed some of the Midwestern charm that made him Harris\u2019s choice. But Vance\u2019s strong performance is likely to buoy Republicans in the days ahead. And the debate\u2019s lasting impact may be to convince members of his party that the Ohio senator \u2013 who is only 40 - has a future in national conservative politics, given his ability to clearly advance their ideological priorities on the brightest of stages.\n\nMore on US election",

        "text": "Shaping the Discourse on Presidential Debates\nAs the 2024 presidential election approaches, Dr. Mitchell S. McKinney, dean of the Buchtel College of Arts and Sciences and political communication scholar, continues to be a prominent voice in the national and international media around debate time. Recognized for his expertise in political communication and presidential debates, McKinney's insights are highly sought after.\n\nThe Vice Presidential debate between Senator J.D. Vance (OH) and Governor Tim Walz (MN) took place October 1, 2024.\n\nWFMJ-TV: Vice Presidential debate recap\n\nWatch the interview\n\nOctober 2, 2024 - McKinney said that both candidates delivered strong performances, focusing on policy and avoiding major missteps. McKinney noted that Vance adopted a \"kinder, gentler\" Republican tone, contrasting with Trump\u2019s typical rhetoric. Vance also acknowledged the need for the GOP to regain women\u2019s trust, particularly on the topic of abortion. Walz, meanwhile, presented himself in a \"folksy\" manner, which complemented his image as a common man.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump prepare for their first debate on September 10, 2024.\n\nC-SPAN Interview: Previewing the Second 2024 Presidential Debate\n\nWatch the interview\n\nSeptember 10, 2024 - McKinney reflected on the impact of the previous presidential debate between former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden and highlighted how that debate significantly shifted the trajectory of the race, culminating in Biden's decision to withdraw from re-election. Looking ahead to the upcoming debate between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, McKinney forecasted a pivotal moment in the campaign, noting that the contrasting styles and messages of the two candidates would offer voters a clear comparative assessment. He also emphasized the tightness of the race and the potential for this debate to sway undecided voters, citing historical precedents where debates played decisive roles in close elections.\n\nWFMJ-TV: Could the presidential debate make or break the race?\n\nWatch the interview\n\nSeptember 10, 2024 - McKinney discussed the high stakes of the upcoming presidential debate between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. He emphasized that, with the race being incredibly close, this debate could significantly influence the outcome of the 2024 election. He also explained how debates have historically played a pivotal role in close contests, shaping voter perceptions and decisions in the final stretch. He pointed out that undecided and not firmly committed voters will be closely watching, making the debate a critical moment for both campaigns.\n\nABC News Article: Memorable Moments from Political Debates Past\n\nRead the article\n\nSeptember 10, 2024 - ABC News highlights key moments in political debate history that have shaped U.S. elections, with experts including McKinney noting that debates offer candidates the chance to either boost or damage their campaigns. From the groundbreaking Kennedy-Nixon debates in 1960 to more recent confrontations, debates have provided memorable and sometimes game-changing exchanges.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump prepare for their first debate on June 27, 2024.\n\nABC News Interview: Presidential Debates' Impact on Voters\n\nWatch the interview\n\nJune 26, 2024 -- McKinney discussed how presidential debates shape voter perceptions. Interviewed by ABC News\u2019 Linsey Davis, one of the journalists who would later moderate the Harris-Trump debate, McKinney highlighted the importance of debates in giving voters a direct comparison of the candidates' leadership, policies, and communication styles. He emphasized that debates are particularly influential in tight races, where strong performances can sway undecided voters, while missteps can severely damage a campaign\u2019s momentum leading up to Election Day.\n\nC-SPAN Interview: Analyzing Debate History and Expectations\n\nWatch the interview\n\nJune 26, 2024 - McKinney appeared on C-SPAN to discuss the historical significance of presidential debates and what to anticipate from the upcoming Biden-Trump face-off. Drawing on his extensive research and practical experience, McKinney provided viewers with a comprehensive overview of how debates have shaped past elections and how this one might influence the current political landscape.\n\nWFMJ-TV: The Stakes of the Upcoming Debate\n\nWatch the interview\n\nJune 24, 2024 - In an interview with WFMJ-TV, McKinney emphasized the critical nature of the upcoming debate, predicting a tightly contested election. He highlighted the importance of the debate in helping undecided voters make their decision, noting that every performance could sway the outcome in such a close race.\n\nTime Magazine: Historical Perspectives on Debate Impact\n\nRead the article.\n\nJune 24, 2024 - McKinney's commentary was featured in Time magazine's article on pivotal presidential debates. He examined key moments from past debates, such as Kennedy-Nixon in 1960 and Carter-Reagan in 1980, offering a nuanced view of how these events influenced election results. McKinney explained that while debates often play a crucial role in close elections, their impact can vary based on the candidates' performances and public perceptions.\n\nThe New Yorker: Decisive Moments in Debate History\n\nRead the article.\n\nJune 23, 2024 - McKinney's analysis appeared in The New Yorker, where he discussed the potential implications of the Biden-Trump debate. He noted that even a small shift in voter attitudes, influenced by a decisive debate performance, could determine the outcome of the election. McKinney's research underscores the importance of these events in razor-thin elections, drawing parallels to the Bush-Gore race in 2000.\n\nGlobal and Local Influence\n\nBeyond the 2024 election, McKinney's research has had a significant impact on the structure and practice of televised debates both in the U.S. and internationally. As an advisor to the U.S. Commission on Presidential Debates, he was instrumental in developing the presidential town hall debate format. His expertise has also been sought by national election commissions in South Korea, Germany, Great Britain, and New Zealand.\n\nMcKinney's work remains at the forefront of political communication scholarship. His frequent commentary for major media outlets like The New York Times, The Washington Post, USA Today, CNN, C-SPAN, NPR, and BBC News further solidifies his reputation as a leading authority on presidential debates.\n\nAs we look forward to the upcoming presidential debate, McKinney's insights will undoubtedly help shape the public's understanding and expectations of this crucial event.\n\nRelated:\n\nStory by: Lisa Craig, 330-972-7429 or lmc91@uakron.edu.",

        "text": "The Arab American Vote 2024\nFor Arab Americans, Israel\u2019s war on Palestinians in Gaza looms large and will play a significant role in this November\u2019s election. This is one of the key observations emerging from a mid-September nationwide poll of 500 Arab American registered voters conducted by John Zogby Strategies for the Arab American Institute.\n\nSince we first began polling Arab Americans 30 years ago, the community has consistently favored the Democratic Party, with the margin of that support holding steady at nearly two to one for the past decade and a half. The Biden Administration\u2019s handling of the crisis in Gaza, however, has eroded that support resulting in Arab Americans now evenly divided between the two parties - 38% for each. Both Democrats and Republicans saw an increase in identification at the expense of Independents. Democrats saw the largest increase in identification after hitting an all-time low (23%) in the immediate aftermath of October 7th. Equally revealing is the fact that by a slight majority of 46% to 43%, voters in the community say they would prefer to see Republicans controlling the next Congress.\n\nTurning to the presidential race, former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are virtually tied, 42% to 41%, with Arab American voters. Looking more closely, with those that report they are very likely to vote, Trump leads Harris 46% to 42%. Only 79% of Democrats support Harris, while 89% of Republicans support Trump. Kamala Harris regained much of the support Biden lost after October 7th, but Harris remains 18 points below Biden\u2019s 2020 level of support with Arab American voters.\n\nWhile some headlines based on a few organizational member surveys have suggested a third-party candidate could garner a plurality of the Arab American vote, this nationwide poll of voters suggests otherwise. All the third-party candidates combined receive just 12% of the Arab American vote. Instead, it\u2019s Trump who is the beneficiary of the community\u2019s anger and despair over the Biden Administration\u2019s failure to prevent the unfolding genocide in Gaza.\n\nTraditionally, Arab American voter turnout has consistently been in the 80% range. But this year, only 63% of the community say they are enthusiastic about voting in the presidential election, likely impacting voter turnout in November. Still, Arab Americans remain an active constituency. Political engagement in the community includes 35% of Republicans, 24% of Democrats, and 37% of 18-29-year-olds who have contributed or plan to contribute to a campaign this election cycle. Looking at more direct action, 32% of Democrats and 28% of Republicans have contacted an elected official, and 37% of 18-29-year-olds have attended a rally or protest this election cycle.\n\nFor these voters, Gaza remains a top issue. Just over 8 out of every 10 (81%) Arab Americans view Gaza as important in determining their vote. Twenty-six percent of Arab Americans overall rated the crisis in Gaza as one of their most important issues. The crisis came second overall behind jobs and the economy, with gun violence following just behind. For Arab American Democrats, Gaza is the top issue overall.\n\nHowever, responses show that there is still time for candidates to capture voter support from those that rank the crisis in Gaza as an immediate concern. When asked if Harris were either to demand an immediate ceasefire and unimpeded humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza or to withhold diplomatic support for and arms shipments to Israel until they implement a ceasefire and withdraw their forces from Gaza, Harris\u2019 vote among Arab Americans increases to around 60%. This new Harris tally captures one-third of Trump voters while virtually wiping out the votes that would go to the third-party candidates. If Trump were to make the same demands on Israel, he too would benefit, increasing his vote tally to 55%. This increased vote count for Trump comes from one-quarter of Harris voters and one-half of the votes going to third-party candidates.\n\nWhile these measures are needed and important to end the war, even less dramatic steps in the midst of a campaign could have been taken to win more Arab American support. For example, more than half (55%) of Arab Americans would have been more likely to support Harris if the DNC allowed a Palestinian American speaker at the convention. This includes 78% of Democrats, 47% of Independents, and 36% of Republicans who stated they would have been more likely to support Harris if there had been a Palestinian speaker.\n\nThe crisis in Gaza has also deeply affected the safety of Arab Americans. The percent of Arab Americans who are concerned about their personal safety has risen from 45% in October of last year to 60%. Since October of 2023, there has been a 14-point rise of Arab Americans who are concerned about facing discrimination due to the violence in Palestine/Israel. Overall, 63% of Arab Americans say they have personally experienced discrimination because of their ethnicity or country of origin. This includes 77% of Arab American 18\u201329-year-olds, an age group in which only 6% said they were not worried about their personal safety due to the violence in Palestine/Israel.\n\nConcern over the effect of the crisis on the community extends beyond personal safety. Nearly three-quarters (73%) of Arab Americans are concerned about the proliferation of anti free speech, anti-BDS Laws. This is true across the political spectrum with 80% of Democrats, 71% of Republicans, and 65% of Independents noting their concern with anti-BDS laws. Worry over discriminatory laws and initiatives continue across communities with 62% of Arab Americans overall, including 69% of Democrats, 62% of Independents, and 55% of Republicans, stating their concern with the efforts to ban Black history and LGBTQ books in schools. At the same time 67%, including 78% of Democrats, 64% of Independents, and 59% of Republicans, are concerned with the scaling back of DEI programs.\n\nFinally, in our thirty years of polling Arab American voters, we have not witnessed anything like the role that the war on Gaza is having on voter behavior. The year-long unfolding genocide in Gaza has impacted every component sub-group within the community - with only slight variations among religious communities and countries of origin, immigrant or native born, gender and age groups. With the catastrophe now facing Lebanon and a little over one month remaining before the election, Arab Americans and, as our polls of US voters have shown, those who share their concerns (young and non-white voters) will be watching to see if their deeply felt concerns with Palestine and Lebanon will be recognized and respected with a promise for change.",

        "text": "New Poll Finds Arab American Voters Evenly Divided in the 2024 Presidential Election\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n\nWednesday, October 2, 2024\n\nMEDIA CONTACT\n\nJennifer Salan, 202-916-8945, jsalan@aaiusa.org\n\nNew Poll Finds Arab American Voters Evenly\n\nDivided in the 2024 Presidential Election\n\nSurvey finds Trump and Harris in a dead heat with\n\nGaza concerns looming large for Arab Americans\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON, DC \u2014 According to a new poll of Arab American voters released today, the Biden Administration\u2019s handling of the crisis in Gaza has eroded Arab American support, resulting in a now evenly divided community with each party receiving 38% support. In the presidential race, former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are virtually tied at 42% to 41%, respectively.\n\nThe poll, the Arab American Vote 2024, found that while Harris regained much of the support President Joe Biden lost after October 7th (see Special Poll: Domestic Implications of the Most Recent Breakout of Violence in Palestine/Israel), at 41%, she remains 18 points below Biden\u2019s 2020 level of support with Arab American voters (59%).\n\nThe Arab American Institute (AAI) has conducted polls of Arab Americans for 30 years. As part of AAI\u2019s voter education and mobilization work, Yalla Vote was launched as an integrated voter engagement project in 1998 and Yalla Vote tracking poll questions have helped inform policy priorities. The poll\u2019s findings will have major implications for the 2024 elections, especially in key states with the highest concentration of Arab American voters.\n\nThe poll\u2019s major findings are:\n\nTrump and Harris in a virtual tie with Arab American voters (42-41%), with 12% supporting third-party candidates. Many undecideds shifted towards Harris after Biden dropped out.\n\nArab Americans identify as Republicans and Democrats at the same rate (38%). The number of Arab Americans who identified as Democrats has rebounded from the all-time low of 23% in October 2023. However, todays 38% remains below the traditional party identification that had the community consistently favoring the Democratic Party (40% Democrat/33% Republicans in 2020 and 52% Democrat/26% Republican in 2016).\n\nOnly 63% of Arab Americans are enthusiastic about voting overall , while 55% of 18-29-year-olds are unenthusiastic about voting . Traditionally, Arab American voter turnout has consistently been in the 80% range. But this year, with only 63% of the community saying they are enthusiastic about voting, Arab American\u2019s lack of excitement for voting in this presidential election is likely to impact voter turnout in November.\n\nYet, Arab Americans remain a politically active constituency . o 35% of Republicans, 24% of Democrats, and 37% of 18-29-year-olds have contributed or plan to contribute to a campaign this election cycle. o 32% of Democrats and 28% of Republicans have contacted an elected official. o 37% of 18-29-year-olds have attended a rally or protest this election cycle.\n\n81% of Arab Americans view Gaza as important in determining their vote .\n\nWhen asked to rank their top issues, the following were the top three for Arab American voters: jobs and the economy (39%), Gaza (26%) and gun violence (21%) . For Arab American Democrats, Gaza ranked as the top issue overall.\n\nThere is room for both candidates to grow if they shifted on Gaza. o When asked if Harris were either to demand an immediate ceasefire and unimpeded humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza or to withhold diplomatic support for and arms shipments to Israel until they implement a ceasefire and withdraw their forces from Gaza, Harris\u2019 vote among Arab Americans increases to around 60% , capturing one-third of Trump voters while virtually wiping out the votes that would go to the third-party candidates. o If Trump were to make the same demands on, he too would benefit, with Trump\u2019s vote increasing to 55% . This increased vote count for Trump comes from one-quarter of Harris voters and one-half of the votes going to third-party candidates.\n\nThe crisis in Gaza has also deeply affected the safety of Arab Americans. o 60% of Arab Americans are concerned about their personal safety, an increase from the 45% reported in October 2023. o 64% of Arab Americans are concerned about facing discrimination, an increase from the 50% reported in October 2023. o Overall, 63% of Arab Americans say they have personally experienced discrimination because of their ethnicity or country of origin, a 10-point increase since April of 2023. 77% of Arab American 18\u201329-year-olds report facing discrimination.\n\n\u201cIn our thirty years of polling Arab American voters, we have not witnessed anything like the role that the war on Gaza is having on voter behavior,\u201d said James Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute. \u201cThe year-long unfolding genocide in Gaza has impacted every component sub-group within the community - with only slight variations among religious communities and countries of origin, immigrant or native born, gender and age groups. With the catastrophe now facing Lebanon and a little over one month remaining before the election, Arab Americans and, as our polls of US voters have shown, those who share their concerns (young and non-white voters) will be watching to see if their deeply felt concerns with Palestine and Lebanon will be recognized and respected with a promise for change.\u201d\n\nAAI commissioned John Zogby Strategies to conduct a survey of 500 Arab American voters. The poll was conducted between 9/9/2024 to 9/20/2024. Based on a confidence interval of 95%, the margin of error for 500 is +/- 4.5 percentage points. This means that all other things being equal, the identical survey repeated will have results within the margin of error 95 times out of 100.\n\n###\n\nThe Arab American Institute is a national civil rights advocacy organization that provides strategic analysis to policymakers and community members to strengthen democracy, protect civil rights and liberties, and defend human rights. AAI organizes the 3.7 million Arab Americans across the country to ensure an informed, organized, and effective constituency is represented in all aspects of civic life.",

        "text": "Hughes Center Poll Finds Election Distrust Persists in N.J.\nGalloway, N.J. \u2013 One-third of all New Jersey voters still doubt the legitimacy of the 2020 election for United States president, according to a poll released Thursday, Oct. 3 by the Hughes Center for Public Policy at Stockton University.\n\nAs many as 24% of New Jersey voters disagreed strongly and 9% disagreed somewhat that the 2020 election for president was fair and secure. The rate remains steady from a March 2021 Stockton poll which found that 34% of New Jerseyans disagreed, at least to some extent, that the 2020 election was fair.\n\nElection distrust persists in 2024. Nearly one-third (31%) said they have little (18%) to no confidence (13%) that votes will be accurately cast and counted in November\u2019s election.\n\nMajorities agree, at least somewhat, that the 2020 election was fair (63%) and are at least somewhat confident that the result will be accurate this year (68%). There is a clear split in election doubt and distrust along party lines.\n\n\u201cThe poll goes to show that years after Jan. 6 and the election turmoil of 2020, election distrust is pretty much baked in among a certain group of voters,\u201d said Alyssa Maurice, the center\u2019s director of Research. \u201cDespite the lack of evidence of widespread fraud, this skepticism is not budging.\u201d\n\nThe poll goes to show that years after Jan. 6 and the election turmoil of 2020, election distrust is pretty much baked in among a certain group of voters. Despite the lack of evidence of widespread fraud, this skepticism is not budging.\u201d Hughes Center Director of Research Alyssa Maurice\n\nThe poll of 630 registered voters was released by the William J. Hughes Center for Public Policy and has a margin of error of +/- 3.9 percentage points.\n\nWith distrust looming over the electoral process, more than one-third (36%) of voters say they have little (26%) to no confidence (10%) that there will be a smooth and peaceful transition of leadership after the election when a new president is sworn into office. About 1 in 5 (22%) are very confident in a smooth transition of power, while 36% are at least somewhat confident and 6% are not sure.\n\nVoters\u2019 trust in other democratic institutions, like a free press, is also low with less than half (45%) saying they are very (12%) or somewhat (34%) confident that journalists will report news related to the election fairly and accurately. One in five are not too confident and one-third are not at all confident. The Hughes Center recently hosted an event with Peter Baker, chief White House correspondent for The New York Times, on journalistic ethics and challenges in the current media landscape, including declining trust.\n\nA majority (62%) of voters are very concerned about the spread of misinformation this election season and 28% are at least somewhat concerned. Less than 10% are not too worried about it.\n\nA little more than half (53%) are very concerned about political violence in the U.S. and nearly one-third (32%) are somewhat concerned. A total of 14% were not too concerned or not at all worried. Consensus was found in denouncing political violence. The overwhelming majority (90%) said political violence is never justified, while small minorities felt it was sometimes warranted to achieve political goals or were not sure (9%).\n\nRepublicans and Democrats were equally concerned about misinformation and political violence at rates ranging from 87% to 95% but differed drastically on trust in the media and the electoral process.\n\nDemocrats Republicans Agree that the 2020 election for U.S. president was fair and secure 96% 25% Confident that votes will be accurately cast and counted in this year\u2019s election 96% 38% Confident that journalists will report news related to the election accurately and fairly 79% 15%\n\nOther findings\n\nThe top issues cited by voters in this year\u2019s election are the economy or inflation (33%), followed by border security (13%), abortion rights (12%), foreign policy and preserving democracy (tied at 5%).\n\nWhen it comes to the presidential ticket, Kamala Harris had the highest favorability rating of all the candidates at 50% (31% very favorable, 19% somewhat favorable). Nearly the same rate (48%) had a somewhat (7%) or very (42%) unfavorable impression of her.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s favorability rating is 43% (31% favorable, 12% somewhat favorable), while a majority (54%) of voters have a very (46%) or somewhat (8%) unfavorable impression of him. Trump\u2019s favorability among New Jersey voters has improved since an October 2020 Stockton poll. According to that poll before the last presidential election, his rating was 37% favorable and 60% unfavorable.\n\nVice presidential candidate Tim Walz prevailed over J.D. Vance in favorability ratings with 44% viewing him positively and 36% saying they have an unfavorable impression. One in five voters were not sure or unfamiliar with Walz. Vance was viewed favorably by 34% of voters and unfavorably by 50%, while 16% were not sure or unfamiliar. Data was collected for this survey before the vice-presidential debate took place Tuesday.\n\nA majority of 78% said the vice-presidential candidate impacts their vote choice for president greatly (22%) or somewhat (56%), while 21% said the nominees for vice president do not influence their vote at all. However, at the time of this poll, the overwhelming majority of voters were already certain (82%) or somewhat certain (8%) of their choice for president, while only 9% said they are still deciding. Vice-presidential selection is one of many factors driving vote selection.\n\nMost voters were unfamiliar with both candidates for the U.S. Senate race in New Jersey. The vast majority (81%) were unfamiliar or unsure about Curtis Bashaw, while a slimmer majority (55%) were unfamiliar with Andy Kim.\n\nFavorable Unfavorable Not sure/Unfamiliar Kamala Harris 50% 48% 1% Donald Trump 43% 54% 2% J.D. Vance 34% 50% 16% Tim Walz 44% 36% 20% Curtis Bashaw 9% 7% 81% Andy Kim 27% 17% 55%\n\nRead the full results of the poll here.\n\nMethodology\n\nThe poll of New Jersey registered voters was conducted by the Stockton Polling Institute of the William J. Hughes Center for Public Policy from Sep. 27-Oct. 1, 2024. Stockton University students texted cell phones with invitations to take the survey online and Opinion Services supplemented the dialing portion of the fieldwork, which consisted of cell and landline telephone calls. Overall, 93% of interviews were conducted on cell phones and 7% on landline phones. In terms of mode, 63% were reached via dialing and 37% were reached via text-to-web. A random sample of 630 New Jersey registered voters were interviewed. Both cell and landline samples consisted of random digit dialing (RDD) and voter list sample from MSG. Data are weighted based on U.S. Census Bureau ACS 2023 data for the citizen voting age population in New Jersey on variables of age, race, education level and sex. The poll's margin of error is +/- 3.9 percentage points at a 95% confidence level. MOE is higher for subsets. Sampling error does not account for other potential sources of bias in polls such as measurement error or nonresponse.\n\nAbout the Hughes Center\n\nThe William J. Hughes Center for Public Policy at Stockton University serves as a catalyst for research, analysis and innovative policy solutions on the economic, social and cultural issues facing New Jersey, and promotes the civic life of New Jersey through engagement, education and research. The center is named for the late William J.

Registration links are available below.\n\nTUCSON, Ariz. \u2014 The University of Arizona School of Government and Public Policy will hold three roundtable discussions before the presidential election.\n\nPart of the Arizona Policy Lab Roundtable Series, the discussions will feature American politics and global democracy experts focusing on key issues surrounding the 2024 U.S. election, including local and international challenges to democracy. The final event will address critical topics related to misinformation, and will include perspectives from industry and academic experts.\n\nThe three roundtables are among various School of Government and Public Policy Election Events \u2013 supported by the Melody S. Robidoux Fund \u2013 for students, faculty and the public.\n\n\"Our three events covering local and global contexts for the election, as well as the key topic of misinformation, were selected as a means of providing our communities with some important materials to help them navigate what promises to be a confusing and contentious election season,\" said Alex Braithwaite, director of the School of Government and Public Policy in the College of Social and Behavioral Sciences. \"These topics also provide us with a great opportunity to showcase the breadth of election-related faculty expertise in the SGPP.\"\n\nMore information about each event is available below.\n\nU.S. Democracy Under Threat? Examining the 2024 Election in an Era of Global Democratic Backsliding\n\nOct. 10, 6-7:30 p.m., Manuel Pacheco Integrated Learning Center, Room 150, and online\n\nRegister for the event\n\nThis is a significant year for elections globally, with over 50 countries holding national elections. Despite the increase in multiparty elections since the 1990s, democracy advocates are concerned about growing illiberal conditions. In countries like France and the Netherlands, questions have arisen about right-wing parties' commitment to democratic norms. This roundtable addresses two key topics: the stability of democracy globally in the post-pandemic era and the United States' standing amid challenges to its election processes.\n\nSuzanne Dovi, Paulette Kurzer, Paul Schuler and Chad Westerland \u2013 all faculty members in the School of Government and Public Policy \u2013 will speak.\n\nForecasting the Issues and Candidates that Will Define the 2024 Election\n\nOct. 24, 6-7:30 p.m., Manuel Pacheco Integrated Learning Center, Room 150, and online\n\nRegister for the event\n\nArizona is expected to be a key swing state in the upcoming U.S. election, with a competitive Senate seat and several tight congressional races. While Democrats made gains in the 2020 and 2022 elections, it's unclear if 2024 will follow the same pattern. Key questions include how Arizona voters differ from the national electorate in their concerns and partisanship, and how the abortion referendum might influence the outcome.\n\nWith data from the Arizona Voter Project and the Arizona Policy Lab, three experts from the School of Government and Public Policy \u2013 Samara Klar, Lisa Sanchez and Chris Weber \u2013 will lend their insights.\n\nThe Politics of Misinformation \u2013 Perspectives from Industry and Academia\n\nOct. 29, 6-7:30 p.m., Student Union Memorial Center, Kiva Room\n\nRegister for the event\n\nAs the 2024 U.S. presidential election nears, misinformation is a major concern for voters and platforms. This panel will examine how false information spreads through social media and messaging platforms, distorting political discourse. Attendees will hear about the challenges of balancing privacy, free speech, transparency and content moderation. The panelists will discuss efforts to combat misinformation, including fact checking, regulatory frameworks and media literacy. Attendees will learn how misinformation is shaping the political landscape and what strategies can mitigate its impact.\n\nCourtney Cooper, an instructor in the School of Government and Public Policy and global policy director at WhatsApp, and Sahana Udupa, professor of media anthropology and Berkman Klein fellow at Harvard University, will share their expertise on digital media and misinformation.

        "text": "Ask an expert: How could labor strikes affect the economy and the election?\nUNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. \u2014 Dockworkers along the U.S. East and Gulf coasts went on strike on Oct. 1, shutting down ports from Maine to Texas. Penn State News spoke with three faculty experts to discuss what the shutdowns mean for consumers and for the Democratic and Republican presidential tickets:\n\nBrent Moritz, associate professor of supply chain management, studies supply chain and operations management.\n\nSteve Tracey, professor of practice in the Department of Supply Chain and Information Systems, researches supply chain strategic planning and implementation.\n\nPaul Clark, professor of labor and employment relations, studies labor unions, strikes and union-management partnerships.\n\nQ: How long could the dockworkers\u2019 strike last, and what are the possible economic implications?\n\nMoritz: I do not think anyone knows how long it will last. However, if it lasts more than a few days, it will begin to be widely disruptive across a range of industries and products. Each day of the disruption will take about five days to clear throughout the U.S. supply chain, so if the strike lasts a week or two, we could see disruptions lasting into early 2025.\n\nThe first places it will be seen is in the imports of fresh produce \u2013 about 75% of bananas come through the East Coast ports, and one cannot simply tell the bananas to stop growing, nor is it easy to re-route fresh fruits from specialized ports such as Wilmington that are equipped to deal with them. Similar issues will happen with other fresh products from the Caribbean and Latin America. The import and export of automobiles and auto parts will cause additional economic dislocation. Like bananas, there are few ways to re-route those auto, and component, imports and exports. The Port of Baltimore handles about 650,000 vehicle imports per year, and about 175,000 exports per year. The Port of Brunswick (Georgia Ports) handles between 500,000 and 600,000 auto imports per year and about 200,000 exports per year. It is just not possible to re-route that many vehicles.\n\nIn economic terms, the Port of New York and New Jersey handled about $271 billion of goods, and the Georgia Ports handled about $174 billion of goods per year in 2022. So, that means disruptions in New York and New Jersey of about $750 million per day, and for the Georgia Ports about $500 million per day in imports and exports.\n\nQ: Why are the dockworkers striking? How might the federal government intervene?\n\nTracey: At issue are two things. The important one, which is the main issue to resolve, is the future of automation on U.S. ports. U.S. port infrastructure is well behind its global peers, and automation is one of those key components. The International Longshoremen\u2019s Association (ILA) sees this as a job-killer and, while that is debatable, it is the main concern on both sides. The second concern is wages, which in the context of the first concern is a non-issue. The U.S. Maritime Alliance (USMX) can give the workers any amount they want if they agree on port infrastructure and automation upgrades. That is the important thing to pay attention to. And, it has to be resolved.\n\nThat said, how long the strike will last depends on the implementation of the Taft-Hartley Act \u2014 my bet is the Biden Administration will change their mind if it looks like it has any material effect on the economy, which could take a while, or if it looks like it is affecting the polls for Harris\u2019 campaign negatively. Or, it could depend on if the ILA and USMX can make meaningful progress in negotiations.\n\nClark: Members of the ILA perform critical work in the United States\u2019 supply chain. Their strike threatens to halt shipments of a wide range of consumer and commercial goods through major eastern and southern ports. If the strike continues for more than a few days, it could result in shortages of goods just as the holiday shopping season begins.\n\nThe president has a legal mechanism he could use to order the workers back to work to protect the economy, but that would be seen as an unfriendly act by the American labor movement that Joe Biden has long supported. The strike also has ramifications for the 2024 presidential election as it could adversely impact the nation\u2019s economy. That would likely hurt Kamala Harris\u2019 chance of capturing the White House.",

The disclosure report cover will be posted on the State Board website along with the data file.\n\nCommittees using the free Campaign Finance Remote Software for the first time this election cycle may manually add the ending balance from the 2024 Second Quarter Report in the software to ensure that election cycle totals are correctly captured. A copy of the software manual is available on the State Board\u2019s website: Campaign Finance Remote Filing Software Manual (PDF). Instructions on how to manually enter ending balances from the 2024 Second Quarter Report can be found on page 30 of the manual. Treasurers may also contact the State Board for assistance at campaign.reporting@ncsbe.gov, or by calling (919) 814-0700 and choosing option 2 for Campaign Finance Department staff.\n\nThe Campaign Finance Department recognizes that there are treasurers who may not be able to file the 2024 Third Quarter Report by Oct. 29, 2024, because of ongoing power and internet outages, loss of records, and personal hardship. These treasurers are encouraged to file disclosure reports as soon as they are able. Pursuant to N.C.G.S. \u00a7 163-278.34(a), the State Board may waive a late filing penalty if it determines there is good cause for the waiver. Treasurers that fail to file the report by the due date will receive instructions on how to request a waiver from the State Board.",

        "text": "Event Recap: American Democracy and the 2024 Election\nOn September 27, 2024, Notre Dame Law School Dean G. Marcus Cole moderated a dynamic panel discussion, \u201cAmerican Democracy and the 2024 Election\u201d on the upcoming U.S. election, featuring prominent voices in journalism and politics. The audience heard insights on key issues, candidates, and potential outcomes that could shape the future of the United States.\n\nFrancis Rooney, Dianne Pinderhughes, G. Marcus Cole,\n\nand Gerald Baker\n\nDean Cole facilitated an engaging dialogue, posing key questions to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the election's complexities. Over the course of the discussion, panelists touched on a variety of topics ranging from campaign spending regulations, mitigating the risk of voter fraud, and the influence of abortion laws, immigration, and foreign policy on voter behavior.\n\nThe panelists included Gerard Baker, editor-at-large of The Wall Street Journal, who shared his decades of experience in political journalism to analyze the electoral landscape.\n\nHe also explained recent phenomena of the Electoral College, noting that it has happened twice this century that candidates won the popular vote but failed to secure the necessary 270 Electoral votes for the presidency.\n\nCarlos Lozada, Pulitzer Prize-winning opinion writer for The New York Times, offered a critical examination of the candidates' platforms, the current political climate, and reforms to electoral procedures in the states.\n\n\u201cIn Georgia, what you\u2019re seeing is not just laws taken up by the legislature. You\u2019re seeing the state election board much more recently introducing rules to the conduct of the election,\u201d he said of Georgia\u2019s new requirement that county-level officials must conduct a manual count of all votes.\n\nDianne Pinderhughes, Notre Dame Presidential Faculty Fellow, and the Rev. Edmund P. Joyce, C.S.C. Professor of Africana Studies and Political Science, added her expertise in racial, ethnic, and gender politics, highlighting the importance of these factors in shaping public policy and voting rights.\n\nDuring the discussion, she focused on recent efforts to limit local governments\u2019 ability to administer elections. \u201cThere have been a whole variety of things that have been intended to constrain the ability of elected officials to operate in a nonpartisan fashion,\u201d she said, citing reforms to the authority of state election boards and secretaries of state.\n\nFormer U.S. Ambassador to the Holy See, Francis Rooney, provided a unique perspective on the international implications of the election and the intersection of faith and politics.\n\nAs a member of George W. Bush\u2019s campaign finance team in 2004, Rooney noted that their total budget was $164 million. \u201cIt\u2019s in the paper this week that Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Michigan are going to spend almost $300 million in their Senate campaigns,\u201d he said, highlighting the sharp uptick in campaign spending over the past two decades. \u201cSomething\u2019s dreadfully wrong and it\u2019s empowering lobbyists and special interest people who exert inordinate amounts of influence on many of our legislators.\u201d\n\nThe event, held in the Law School\u2019s McCartan Courtroom, was co-sponsored by the Rooney Center, Notre Dame Law School and the Notre Dame Democracy Initiative.\n\nWatch a recap of the event below.",

        "text": "NYU Law Forum reviews the Supreme Court\u2019s last term and looks ahead\nAhead of the US Supreme Court\u2019s new term, a panel of constitutional law experts gathered on September 18 to review the Court\u2019s most recent decisions in an NYU Law Forum, sponsored by Latham & Watkins. The 2023\u201324 term saw the Court deliberate over a slate of controversial issues, from presidential immunity to access to medical abortion, even as it faced heightened public scrutiny. Joining moderator Melissa Murray, Frederick I. and Grace Stokes Professor of Law, at the Forum were Kelsi Corkran, Supreme Court director at the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at Georgetown University Law Center; Ann Marimow, the Washington Post\u2019s Supreme Court correspondent; and Roman Martinez, a partner at Latham & Watkins.\n\nMelissa Murray\n\nThe panel also previewed the Court\u2019s forthcoming docket for the term that begins on October 7, which Murray noted promises to deliver plenty of action. \u201cThis term has everything!\u201d she said. Panelists agreed that Garland v. VanDerStock is a case to watch. It centers around \u201cghost guns\u201d and whether the Alcohol Firearms and Tobacco Agency has regulatory authority over these untraceable homemade weapons. Another upcoming case that garnered the panel\u2019s attention is United States v. Skrmetti, a challenge to bans on gender-affirming care for minors in Kentucky and Tennessee. At issue is whether state laws that restrict children and teenagers from using hormone therapy or puberty blockers violate the Equal Protection Clause of the US Constitution.\n\nPanelists also weighed the prospect of the Court having to grapple with sudden legal challenges arising from the 2024 presidential election. The likelihood that justices could see cases of that sort is high, the panel reasoned. But perhaps not surprisingly, they were split as to whether the Court should actually intervene if such a scenario were to occur.\n\n\n\nSelected remarks from the NYU Law Forum discussion:\n\n\n\nRoman Martinez: \u201c[In US v. Skrmetti], you have a very hard problem to deal with, a policy problem to deal with. And the question is, I think the conservative-leaning justices might view this as a situation where, in the face of a challenging policy problem, are we going to constitutionalize the problem by finding in the Constitution something in the Bill of Rights or in the 14th Amendment that prevents states from acting?\u201d (video 50:57)\n\nKelsi Corkran: \u201cI would say what to keep your eye on in this space\u2014or in everything the Supreme Court does\u2014is how power is being transferred among the branches. So [last term\u2019s Loper Bright v. Raimondo]\u2014and I think [SEC v. Jarkesy], and [Corner Post Inc. v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System] as well\u2014are cases that are [making] a huge transfer of power from the executive branch, which for a long time the assumption has been [that] as a matter of separation of powers, Congress makes the law and then the executive branch experts within the agencies decide things like whether amino acid polymers are proteins within the FDA organic statute or whatever it is. And so [Loper] is: \u2018No, we the courts are going to decide those things in the first instance, de novo.\u2019\u201d (video 43:20)\n\nAnn Marimow, Supreme Court correspondent for the Washington Post: \u201cI think that there will be perhaps fewer [election-related] cases. Rick Hasen, an election law expert, makes the point that during COVID, a lot of the states were changing their election rules at the last minute, having to do with absentee ballots and signatures. So that was a lot of what was coming to the Court then. But I also know that both political parties are already filing many challenges. The Court has already gotten involved in a case from Arizona having to do with whether or not you have to show citizenship when you register to vote. So I think even if the Court wants to stay out of [the 2024 presidential race], they will definitely be drawn in.\u201d (video 56:31)\n\nPosted October 3, 2024",

        "text": "The US presidential election\u2019s implications for chemistry\nNext month\u2019s US presidential election is sure to affect scientists\u2014but exactly how a win for Donald J. Trump or Kamala Harris would ripple through the chemical enterprise remains unclear.\n\nScience has been a major plank in previous presidential platforms. This time, it\u2019s \u201cincredibly conspicuous by its absence,\u201d says Andrew Maynard, a policy expert at Arizona State University.\n\nWe very much ascribe to the idea that the government is the lead investor in innovation. Fred Ledley, founding director, the Center for Integration of Science and Industry at Bentley University\n\nEach candidate\u2019s stated priorities and in-office record leave certain science policy questions unanswered. It is unclear how far Harris, who became the Democratic Party\u2019s candidate in late July, intends to depart from Biden-Harris administration policies. Meanwhile, Republican Party nominee Trump has a track record in the Oval Office, but his intentions toward the policies described in Project 2025, a detailed agenda developed by conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation and many former Trump administration officials, are murky. Trump has distanced himself from the project.\n\nAdding complication, what the next US president can accomplish will depend on the balance of power in Congress\u2014which will also be decided in this election\u2014and a global political context that demands containing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, as well as reexamining the evolving relationship between the US and China.\n\nCredit: J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo\n\nStill, chemists can expect starkly different presidential visions to influence the federal budget, the actions of executive agencies, and the fate of various pieces of legislation, such as the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), which affects many industries. These differences will have implications for pharmaceutical and clean technology companies, immigration, academia, and chemical regulations. Here are the details.\n\nThe US federal government spends roughly $180 billion annually on research and development overseen by federal agencies, universities, and businesses, and the executive branch has considerable influence over how that money is allocated.\n\nHarris, whose first job was cleaning pipettes in her mother\u2019s laboratory, cosponsored a scientific workforce diversity bill as a senator, and as vice president cast the tiebreaking vote to pass the IRA, investing billions of dollars in research. Given her stated priorities, experts predict that a Harris administration would continue to invest in technology, clean energy, and responsible AI development.\n\nA long way from budget to spending\n\n\n\nThe policies of a second Trump presidency could be less predictable. Project 2025 proposes a complete overhaul of federal research infrastructure, consolidating some agencies and eliminating others altogether. Such a move could disrupt the basic science ecosystem\u2014but experts disagree on whether it is likely to occur. Tepring Piquado, executive director of the advocacy group National Science Policy Network, says \u201cthere\u2019s a very serious possibility\u201d that a substantial reorganization might proceed. But Arizona State\u2019s Maynard considers it less likely in the short term because it\u2019s difficult for presidents to make radical changes. For example, although the first Trump administration had proposed \u201cmassive cuts\u201d to National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation budgets, by the end of the appropriations process, research funding had in fact increased. The uncertainty has ramifications for life science and other research: Trump has attempted to intervene in US Food and Drug Administration business before, and he worked to pare down the budgets of federal research agencies during his presidency, which\u2014if repeated\u2014would have a trickle-down effect on the pace of innovation, says Fred Ledley, founding director of the Center for Integration of Science and Industry at Bentley University.\n\nMeanwhile, Maynard says, \u201cthere are fears that under a Republican-led administration, there\u2019ll be more restrictions on what funded researchers are allowed to do.\u201d For example, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump\u2019s rival turned political ally, has proposed an agenda that would devote half of the NIH budget to \u201cpreventive, holistic and alternative\u201d medicine.\n\nSuch limits concern advocates of scientific integrity in government, like Andrew Rosenberg, a senior fellow in public policy at the University of New Hampshire. Scientific integrity, Rosenberg says, encompasses any use of data to make decisions\u2014which can have major impacts on constituents. When the Trump White House altered a hurricane forecast map, apparently for political benefit, Rosenberg says, \u201cFEMA [the US Federal Emergency Management Agency] had to move resources away from areas that were actually at risk.\u201d\n\nThe Union of Concerned Scientists counted over 200 cases of political interference in science-based decision-making during the Trump administration. (The same report noted 19 cases during two Obama terms, and two in the first 3\u00bd years of the Biden administration). Advocates have pressed for legal protection for scientific integrity in government agencies, but such a law failed to pass. In its place, the Biden administration used an executive memorandum to require federal agencies to develop scientific integrity policies. But Jacob Carter, an advocate for scientific integrity policies, says reversing past executive actions is easy for a new president. \u201cWith the stroke of a pen, all of that can be undone.\u201d\n\nCredit: Shutterstock\n\nOne of the few places where Harris and Trump are aligned is in a desire to reduce health-care costs. But their approaches are very different.\n\nHarris has thrown her weight behind the IRA, which she advanced as vice president under Biden. The IRA includes measures that give federal health insurance program Medicare greater power to negotiate the prices of certain drugs. Only 10 drugs have been identified for negotiations since the IRA\u2019s implementation in 2022. Harris says that as president, she\u2019d \u201caccelerate\u201d those negotiations to cover more drugs\u2014a change that the biopharmaceutical industry, already upset over the IRA\u2019s drug-pricing provisions, has decried. Private insurers typically follow Medicare pricing.\n\n\u201cDoubling down on failed government price setting schemes\u2014whether in the form of expanding the flawed IRA or copying foreign health care systems\u2014would leave patients with fewer choices and less access to future innovative medicines,\u201d Catherine Hill, a spokesperson for the trade group PhRMA, says by email. PhRMA is behind a lawsuit arguing that the IRA\u2019s drug-pricing measures are unconstitutional under the Fifth and Eighth Amendments.\n\nTrump and running mate J. D. Vance have said they\u2019d undo much of the IRA if elected; Project 2025 calls for its repeal. But repealing legislation is easier said than done, and unless PhRMA prevails in its lawsuit, revising the IRA would require action from Congress, not just the executive branch. \u201cThe baseline assumption should be that IRA is here to stay,\u201d says Muna Tuna, a partner at EY who advises life science firms on market access, pricing, and reimbursement.\n\nInstead of supporting price negotiations led by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Trump has called for the reinstatement of a policy he put forward during his presidential term: a \u201cmost favored nation,\u201d or MFN, model, which would tie Medicare drug prices to prices paid for drugs in other countries. The rule enacted during his presidency sparked several lawsuits from the pharmaceutical industry that led to a nationwide injunction and was eventually rescinded.\n\nPeter Neumann, who studies cost effectiveness in health care at Tufts Medical Center, says that a new MFN rule might have a \u201cmuch bigger impact than the IRA.\u201d But he cautions that it would depend heavily on how it\u2019s implemented\u2014and like the IRA, it would likely require legislation.\n\nAs November approaches, the biopharmaceutical industry finds itself on uncertain ground.\n\n\u201cWe very much ascribe to the idea that the government is the lead investor in innovation,\u201d says Ledley of Bentley University. \u201cWhether it\u2019s computers or life sciences or anything else, that\u2019s the lifeblood that fuels the industry.\u201d\n\nBoth candidates have vowed to tackle border security and illegal crossings into the US\u2014albeit using different approaches. But it\u2019s unclear how rules might change for employment-based immigration, which scientists, institutions, and businesses are monitoring closely.\n\nAccording to the National Science Foundation\u2019s latest report on the state of US science and engineering, individuals born outside the US accounted for 19% of the country\u2019s science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce and 43% of doctorate-level scientists and engineers in 2021. The federal agency has said that the US is facing a STEM talent crisis and must attract and retain high-skilled individuals from around the world while ramping up domestic STEM talent.\n\nScientists and engineers born outside the US\n\n\n\nTrump, for instance, has proposed granting permanent resident cards, also known as green cards, to vetted citizens of countries outside the US after they\u2019ve graduated from US colleges and universities. Typically, graduates are able to apply for temporary work visas that are often issued for up to 3 years, while a green card is valid for 10 years and can be renewed to maintain permanent resident status. But Trump\u2019s proposed plan would exclude applicants or revoke visas for those considered \u201cradical Islamists, Hamas supporters, America haters,\u201d as part of an aggressive vetting process, according to his campaign\u2019s national press secretary, Karoline Leavitt.\n\nTrump has also talked about restoring and expanding a travel ban that he imposed in 2017\u2014which Biden rescinded in 2021\u2014to stop the entry of citizens from certain Muslim-majority nations. In 2017, C&EN reported on how this ban upended the lives of many scientists.\n\nTrump has mentioned raising tariffs on Chinese imports and may attempt to reinstate the controversial 2018 China Initiative, which aimed to address theft of US intellectual property and technology secrets but reportedly led to racial profiling and increased targeting of scholars and scientists of Chinese descent. Bringing back such a program could jeopardize lives and careers, erode trust, and \u201cstifle scientific collaboration and compromise America\u2019s leadership in global innovation,\u201d says Cindy Tsai, interim president of Committee of 100, a nonprofit concerned with Chinese American interests headquartered in New York City.\n\nHarris, on the other hand, is the daughter of immigrant parents, but what her presidency might mean for high-skilled individuals who have already been granted or are seeking work visas and green cards remains to be determined. In the past, she has advocated lifting per-country caps for employment-based green cards, since the policy has caused huge backlogs that have particularly affected individuals from India and China.\n\nThe Biden-Harris administration has worked largely to increase environmental protections. In contrast, former president Trump\u2019s actions tended to be more deregulatory. One of Trump\u2019s first executive orders, issued in 2017, said that for every new regulation a federal department or agency put in place, two had to be eliminated.\n\nDuring the Biden administration, the US Environmental Protection Agency received funding from the IRA, which it used to create the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, designed to finance projects to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions in communities across the country. While running for the presidential nomination in 2020, Harris promised to ban fracking, which releases large amounts of the potent greenhouse gas methane, but she recently walked back those statements, saying she would not ban the practice.\n\nCleantech politics\n\n\n\nDuring his administration, former president Trump tended to weaken or eliminate policies to reduce greenhouse gases. He pulled the US out of the Paris Agreement, an international treaty to cut greenhouse gas emissions to limit global temperature rise to below 2 \u00b0C above preindustrial levels. (Biden rejoined the agreement in 2021.) The Trump administration also worked to erode the National Ambient Air Quality Standards, one of the main national policies to combat air pollution. Some changes included placing more industry-based and anti-regulatory members on scientific advisory committees and limiting the scientific research that these committees are permitted to consider.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRestrictions on toxic chemicals have been a priority for the Biden-Harris administration, but only a handful of regulations have made it onto the books. Environmental advocacy groups worry that a second Trump administration could weaken or completely nix some of those rules, particularly ones that were challenged by chemical companies.\n\nOne of the new rules, which the EPA finalized in April, sets limits for six per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in drinking water. In an analysis released Sept. 19, the advocacy organization Environmental Working Group (EWG) finds that more than 700 water utilities serving at least 40 million people in the US need to remove PFAS from their water to meet the new limits. \u201cBut the next administration could weaken or roll back the standards, which would imperil the safety of drinking water in almost every state,\u201d the EWG report says.\n\nThe fates of rules that the EPA has proposed but not finalized and rules not yet officially proposed are up in the air. One example is a rule to limit wastewater discharges from PFAS manufacturers that the EPA has yet to propose because of pushback from the chemical industry. A Harris administration would likely help this rule across the finish line. The rule\u2019s future would be uncertain under Trump because of his administration\u2019s record of favoring the chemical industry.\n\nThe future of these rules and other environmental protections would be uncertain under either potential administration, in part because of pending lawsuits. According to the EWG report, if those lawsuits are successful, \u201cor if the next administration chooses not to fight\u201d them, the court could scrap the rules or send them back to the EPA to revise.\n\nThe Biden administration poured an enormous amount of government funding into clean technology projects through the bipartisan infrastructure law and 2022\u2019s Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) and Science Act. In addition to addressing drug prices, the IRA also provides expansive support for technologies like batteries, clean hydrogen, and carbon capture.\n\nSeveral cleantech analysts expect that the smooth implementation of the existing decarbonization laws would be the centerpiece of Harris\u2019s energy policy.\n\nCredit: Rick Bowmer/AP Photo\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has said he would \u201crescind all unspent funds\u201d from the IRA. Project 2025 criticizes the IRA for turning the Department of Energy into a massive cleantech R&D organization, and it calls on Trump to repeal the law and get the government out of the business of commercializing new energy technologies.\n\nBut Joseph Brazauskas, an attorney who works on policy at the law firm Bracewell in Washington, DC, says it will be hard to garner enough support in Congress to dramatically cut the IRA\u2019s tax credits for cleantech. He and other experts anticipate that Trump would instead use agency rule-making to shape regulations from the IRA and other legislation to be more favorable for oil and gas companies.\n\nBenefits from the IRA have flowed disproportionately toward parts of the country that typically vote for Republicans. In August, a group of 18 Republicans sent a letter to the Speaker of the US House of Representatives arguing that Congress should retain some IRA tax credits because they have \u201cspurred innovation, incentivized investment, and created good jobs.\u201d\n\nThe results of the upcoming election will nonetheless have a big impact on how tax credits for cleantech are doled out. Federal agencies are still writing final rules for many IRA programs. The current administration has proposed stringent rules to ensure that low-carbon hydrogen doesn\u2019t pull existing renewable energy out of the grid. And companies that capture carbon dioxide emissions have to show that they are permanently sequestering carbon, rather than using it for oil production, to secure the largest tax credits.\n\nAgencies in a second Trump administration could propose looser rules for IRA tax credits related to hydrogen production or carbon capture, according to Derrick Flakoll, a North American policy analyst at the research firm BloombergNEF.\n\nOutside the IRA, Trump has pledged to revoke limits the EPA recently placed on the greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, which would curtail demand for point-source carbon capture technology.\n\nFlakoll says another area to watch is the Department of Energy\u2019s Loan Programs Office (LPO), an agency that provides financing for new energy-related technologies.\n\nThe executive branch controls the organization, which went nearly dormant during Trump\u2019s presidency. Flakoll expects that activity could significantly slow down if Trump wins.\n\nSince Biden took office in 2021, the LPO has given out a flurry of loans for chemical industry projects, such as Solugen\u2019s biobased chemical plant in Minnesota and Lithium Americas\u2019 lithium mine and processing facility in Nevada. The agency is working its way through hundreds of applications across the spectrum of biobased and low-CO 2 chemical manufacturing.\n\nFlakoll says the projects funded by the LPO have earned support from conservative and liberal policymakers who want to strengthen US manufacturing capabilities. But that\u2019s no guarantee that Trump will leave the LPO or other federal cleantech programs intact.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say what he will ultimately decide to do, or what his advisors will tell him to do,\u201d Flakoll says.\n\nThe next president will have a significant impact on the resources available to cleantech companies, Brazauskas says. Industry would rather work within clear and consistent regulation\u2014and whittle away at the bits it doesn\u2019t like through lobbying and litigation\u2014than chase after a chaotic and unpredictable regulatory regime.",

        "text": "Election 2024: Where the Election Stands One Month Before Election Day\nElection Day is just over a month away. After two national party conventions, two presidential assassination attempts, a presumptive nominee dropping out of the race for the first time in U.S. history, two presidential debates with different participants, and a vice-presidential debate, the presidential race remains where it started\u2014neck and neck.\n\nJust how close is the race? As of today, the 538 average of national polls has Kamala Harris up by 2.6 points over Donald Trump. The Real Clear Politics average of national polls has her up by 2.2 points. That might sound like a notable lead. But if 2020 is any guide, a two to three point lead in national polls gives a Democratic candidate only a 46 percent chance of winning. A look at the polls of battleground states shows why: Those poll results are closer than the national margin and within their own margins of error.\n\nWith the race going down to the wire, five questions stand out:\n\nThe Water's Edge James M.

Trump overperformed compared to the polls in both 2016 and 2020 as pollsters had difficulty in both reaching his supporters and determining whether they would vote. However, he underperformed his polling numbers in many primary races earlier this year. That underperformance may reflect the challenges of polling in low turnout primary races, or it may reflect shifting sentiments among Republican voters. We won\u2019t find out which is the correct explanation until Election Day.\n\n2. How good is each campaign\u2019s \u201cground game\u201d? When swing voters look to be in short supply, as looks to be the case today, the focus shifts to turning out one\u2019s own voters. Democrats have invested heavily in their ground game, fueled by an influx of campaign contributions after Joe Biden gave way to Harris as the nominee. Meanwhile, there has been grumbling in Republican circles that the Trump campaign is relying too much on outside groups to turn out the vote. The Trump campaign, however, insists that its nontraditional approach is working.\n\n3. Will third-party candidates swing the outcome of the election? No third-party candidate caught on with the voters in the 2024 election cycle. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. came closest, but he left the race in August. While candidates like Chase Oliver of the Libertarian Party and Jill Stein of the Green Party are barely registering in national polls, they\u2014along with Kennedy in some cases\u2014are on the ballot in critical battleground states. The votes they win could draw votes away from Harris or Trump, possibly changing the results in a battleground state, and if things are close enough, nationally as well.\n\n4. Will America\u2019s election infrastructure hold up under the stress of a close election? As I wrote last week, Election 2024 will test America\u2019s election infrastructure. The director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said on Wednesday that the country\u2019s voting systems are so secure that \u201cmalicious actors, even if they tried, could not have an impact at scale such that there would be a material effect on the outcome of the election.\u201d (Fingers crossed that statement doesn\u2019t make the list of terrible predictions.) However, the Department of Homeland Security worries about the security of election workers and officials. It warned this week that domestic violent extremists \u201cwill pose the most significant physical threat to government officials, voters, and elections-related personnel and infrastructure.\u201d Efforts to disrupt voting and the vote count may not come just from people outside the process. One Christian nationalist group has been encouraging its followers to take positions as election workers as part of what the group\u2019s founder calls \u201cour Trojan horse\u201d effort. It\u2019s not an unthinkable threat. Just this week, an election-denying county clerk in Colorado was sentenced to nine years in prison for giving someone unauthorized access to the county\u2019s election system.\n\n5. Will Americans believe the results when they come in? Elections depend on trust. If voters don\u2019t believe that votes have been counted fairly and accurately, a democracy breaks down. But just two out of three Americans are confident that the votes be counted accurately in November. The partisan split on that question is large: 90 percent of Democrats think the vote count will be accurate, while just 46 percent of Republicans do. Trump\u2019s insistence that he won in 2020 and his refusal to say unequivocally that he will accept the results of the 2024 election explains that gap. A Trump loss next month could fuel another \u201cstop the steal\u201d movement. But if Trump wins in a close and contested fashion, it could be Democrats complaining about a stolen election. Neither outcome would be good for the health of American democracy.\n\nI began this series of posts by predicting that Election 2024 could produce considerable turbulence. Eleven months later, that remains the case. So stay buckled up.\n\nCampaign Update\n\nThe judge in the federal case against Trump for attempting to overturn the results of the 2020 election unsealed a 165-page brief submitted by special counsel Jack Smith. Smith\u2019s brief was necessitated by the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in July that presidents are immune from criminal prosecution for acts conducted as part of their official duties. Smith sought to show that much of the original indictment against Trump could survive the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling because he was acting in his personal capacity and, as a result, his \u201cscheme\u201d to remain in office qualified as \u201ca private criminal effort.\u201d Trump blasted the decision to unseal the government\u2019s brief:\n\nThe former president\u2019s strategy of seeking to delay, if not prevent, the trial\u2019s start is part of the reason that a detailed outline of the government\u2019s case against him was released just a month before Election Day.\n\nAn estimated 43 million people watched JD Vance and Tim Walz square off on Tuesday night in the first, and likely only, vice presidential debate. That\u2019s about a third fewer people than watched the Harris-Trump debate last month and about quarter less than the audience that watched Harris debate Mike Pence four years ago. Early polls suggested that the debate was a wash. Forty-eight percent of those who watched it deemed Vance the winner, while 46 percent gave the nod to Walz. Even if these numbers are off, the debate isn\u2019t likely to change the course of the election. Vice-presidential debates seldom do.\n\n\n\nHarris had a good week on the endorsement front. Most important\u2014at least if you are old enough to remember receiving the October 27, 1975, issue of Time magazine in your mailbox or know immediately what song hails the \u201cswamps of Jersey\u201d\u2014she got the endorsement of the one and only Bruce Springsteen. The Boss called Trump the most \u201cdangerous candidate for president in my lifetime.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times and the New Yorker also endorsed Harris. The Times called her the \u201conly patriotic choice for president,\u201d while the New Yorker said she \u201chas displayed the basic values and political skills that would enable her to build on the successes of the Biden Administration and to help end, once and for all, a poisonous era defined by Trump.\u201d Meanwhile, two dozen Wisconsin Republicans, including a sitting Republican district attorney, released an open letter declaring their support for Harris.\n\nHarris, however, did not pick up a hoped for endorsement from the International Association of Fire Fighters. The union, which represents more than 300,000 fire fighters and emergency responders and which was the first union to endorse Biden in 2020, said that its leaders decided \u201cby a margin of 1.2%\u201d against picking a candidate. The union\u2019s decision to sit on the sideline was a surprise given that its members booed JD Vance when he spoke at its annual conference this summer.\n\nTrump did not go empty-handed on the endorsement front this week. More than three hundred Republican luminaries, including former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, former Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin, former Attorney General William Barr, and former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, endorsed Trump. Their joint letter called Trump a \u201cpeacemaker\u201d and argued that the Biden administration had \u201cimperiled our national security.\u201d Barr had previously warned of \u201cchaos\u201d if Trump returned to the White House, while Haley has called Trump \u201cunhinged,\u201d \u201cdiminished,\u201d and \u201cnot qualified to be the president of the United States.\u201d\n\nRepublican Party efforts to encourage Republican voters to vote by mail may not be working, at least in Pennsylvania. Trump blamed his 2020 election loss on mail-in ballots, and earlier this year he told a rally in Michigan that \"mail-in voting is totally corrupt.\u201d Trump has since tempered his complaints, going so far as to urge his supporters to take advantage of it. The Republican Party has prioritized mail-in voting in Pennsylvania. However, despite spending millions on the effort, Republican voters don\u2019t appear to be answering the call. Data from the Pennsylvania secretary of state\u2019s office shows that 881,000 registered Democrats have requested mail-in ballots, while just 373,000 registered Republicans have done likewise.\n\nWhat the Candidates Are Saying\n\nHarris on Tuesday denounced Iran as a \u201cdangerous and destabilizing\u201d force in the Middle East after its ballistic missile attack on Israel. She added that \u201cI fully support President Biden's order for the U.S. military to shoot down Iranian missiles targeting Israel.\"\n\nAn escalation of fighting in the Middle East likely would complicate Harris\u2019s presidential run. She could expect to hear complaints that she should be back in Washington rather than campaigning. Perhaps more important, an expanded conflict would help make Trump\u2019s case that global disorder has grown on Biden\u2019s watch.\n\nSpeaking of growing global disorder, Trump said that Iran\u2019s missile attack on Israel was evidence that \u201cthe world right now is spiraling out of control\u201d and that we \u201care very close to global catastrophe\u201d because \u201cwe have a non-existent president and a non-existent vice president.\u201d\n\nTrump raised the topic of global disorder at a subsequent press conference. He said that \u201cthere\u2019s a big chance of a world war. We have two hotspots, and we\u2019ll have probably have a third.\u201d Ukraine, the Middle East, and Taiwan were the hotspots Trump had in mind.\n\nTrump went on to add that if he had continued in office as president that \u201ceveryone including Iran would have been in the Abraham Accords\u201d and that the fundamental cause of conflict in the Middle East was \u201ca lack of respect for the United States.\u201d The former seems highly unlikely. The latter exaggerates the sway that the United States has, and has had, in the Middle East.\n\nWhat the Pundits Are Saying\n\nMichael B.G. Froman, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, argued in Foreign Affairs that the next president needs to think long and hard about whether and how to continue the current trend toward valuing resilience, diversification, and national security over competitiveness, efficiency, and growth in U.S. trade policy. Thinking systematically about policies such as export controls, investment restrictions, and tariffs \u201cmeans understanding their limitations, developing principles to guide their use, and grappling fully with the tradeoffs they involve. Otherwise, these tools of economic statecraft are likely to be applied on an ad hoc basis and in response to special pleading. That, in turn, would run the risk of endless expansion with limited effectiveness\u2014and too little consideration of their costs.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times explored the heavy investment that the Trump campaign and related groups are making in challenging voting laws around the country. So far, roughly three times as many lawsuits have been filed as at this time four years ago. \u201cThe volume and last minute timing of the cases,\u201d write the Times, \u201calong with statements from party officials and Trump allies, suggest a broader aim behind the effort: Laying the groundwork to challenge results after the vote. The claims in the lawsuits may well be revived\u2014either in court or in the media\u2014if Mr. Trump contests the outcome.\u201d Democrats, meanwhile, aren\u2019t sitting idly by. They are contesting the Republican lawsuits and filing some of their own.\n\nWhat the Polls Show\n\nThe Institute for Global Affairs released a detailed report on how Harris and Trump voters see the world. The report\u2019s topline finding is that \u201cnationally, Kamala Harris is seen as the candidate more likely to pursue a foreign policy which \u2018benefits people like you,\u2019 improve America\u2019s international reputation, be a strong leader who advances America\u2019s interests internationally, and less likely to send US troops to an unnecessary war. In swing states, however, Donald Trump has the edge on each of these.\u201d\n\nThe Pearson Institute for the Study and Resolution of Global Conflicts and the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, which are both located at the University of Chicago, released a poll this week on how the U.S. public view the Israel-Hamas conflict a year after the October 7 attack. The overall finding was that \u201cmany public attitudes toward the conflict have remained relatively stable.\u201d Support for a two-state did rise slightly, from 22 percent to 29 percent. However, 49 percent of respondents said they neither favored nor opposed the idea.\n\nThe Campaign Schedule\n\nElection Day is thirty-two days away (November 5, 2024).\n\nElectors will meet in each state and the District of Columbia to cast their votes for president and vice president in seventy-four days (December 17, 2024).\n\nThe 119th U.S. Congress will be sworn into office in ninety-one days (January 3, 2025).\n\nThe U.S. Congress will certify the results of the 2024 presidential election in ninety-four (January 6, 2025).\n\nInauguration Day is 108 days away (January 20, 2025).\n\nOscar Berry assisted in the preparation of this post.",

He was asked the question during a surprise appearance at a White House press briefing on Friday, telling reporters: \"Whether he\u2019s trying to influence the election, I don\u2019t know - but I\u2019m not counting on that.\u201d Biden then directed some terse words at his longtime ally: \u201cNo administration has helped Israel more than I have. None, none, none,\" he said. \"And I think [Netanyahu] should remember that.\" Some Democrats have voiced concern that Netanyahu is ignoring the US president's calls to negotiate a ceasefire and hostage release deal in order to harm the party's chances in November.\n\nEarlier this week, Democratic Senator Chris Murphy told CNN: \u201cI don\u2019t think you have to be a hopeless cynic to read some of Israel\u2019s actions, some of Prime Minister Netanyahu\u2019s actions, as connected to the American election.\" Polls suggest the escalating violence in the Middle East and the failure to secure a diplomatic agreement is hurting Biden and his replacement as the Democratic candidate, Kamala Harris. The president's approval rating among Arab-Americans has plummeted over the past year, largely due to anger at US support for Israel\u2019s military campaign, and this could damage the party's prospects in November. Biden has been pushing for a diplomatic agreement between Israel and Hamas for months, and has indicated several times that one is close. A deal before the election would be a major boost for the president and the Democratic Party but appears increasingly unlikely.",

        "text": "Colloquy Podcast: How Reliable Are Election Forecasts?\nJust after Labor Day, American University Professor and Harvard Griffin GSAS alumnus, Allan Lichtman predicted a victory for Democratic candidate Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. It was a source of some encouragement for Harris's supporters, given that Lichtman had correctly predicted the winner of 9 of the last 10 elections based on his historical analysis of campaign trends since 1860.\n\nDespite his track record, Lichtman has been scorned by election forecasters like Nate Silver , who build probabilistic models based on weighted averages from scores of national and state-level polls. But are these quantitative models really any more reliable than ones that leverage historical fundamentals, like Lichtman's, or, for that matter, a random guess?\n\nThe Stanford University political scientist Justin Grimmer, PhD \u201910, and his colleagues, Dean Knox of the University of Pennsylvania and Sean Westwood of Dartmouth, published research last August evaluating US presidential election forecasts like Silver's. Their verdict? Scientists and voters are decades to millennia away from assessing whether probabilistic forecasting provides reliable insights into election outcomes. In the meantime, they see growing evidence of harm in the centrality of these forecasts and the horse race campaign coverage they facilitate.\n\nThis month on Colloquy: Justin Grimmer on the reliability of probabilistic election forecasts.\n\nThis transcript has been edited for clarity.\n\nTalk a little about probabilistic election forecasting. How does it work? How is it different from traditional polling? And how did it come to dominate public debate, drive obsessive media discussion, and influence campaign strategy as you write in the abstract of your paper?\n\nSo, let's just think about what a traditional poll is. So, a polling firm will go out and, one way or another, will try to get a sample of respondents. And they'll ask them, \u201cHow likely are you to participate in this election?\u201d And then among the people who are likely to participate, they'll say, \u201cGoing to vote for Trump? Are you going to vote for Harris?\u201d You run that poll and the result of that is going to be some estimate of what the vote share is going to be. Maybe it's for a state. Maybe it's for the whole country. That's going to be one component that's inputted into these probabilistic election models.\n\nSo, what's going on in these models is that they're going to aggregate together lots of different polling information, usually trying to construct some average of those polls. And it's also going to bring in other information, maybe about the approval rate of the president. Maybe it'll be about unemployment. Or perhaps it's about US involvement in foreign conflict. Combining that information together into a big statistical model, it's going to come up with essentially a probability of a particular candidate winning.\n\nUsually what these models will do is they'll have some big model. And then they're going to do a lot of simulations based on these models and the statistical assumptions. And then after running those many simulations, they'll say that 600 out of 1,000 times Harris won in our simulation; 400 out of 1,000 times Trump won. And, therefore, we think there's a 60 percent chance that Harris is going to win this election. Along the way, they might also calculate things like the number of Electoral College votes they think a candidate is going to receive or the share of the popular vote. But the key thing is going to be that probability of a particular candidate winning.\n\nAround 2008, [data journalist] Nate Silver really in earnest started putting these forecasts together, gathering polling data, and constructing these probabilities. And, notably, in 2008 and 2012, what Silver forecasted came to pass. He thought Barack Obama would win both of those elections. And he forecasted a large number of those states. Well, because of this, it became clear to, I think, a lot of news outlets that this was a way in which they could drive a lot of coverage about the election.\n\nIt turns out it's a nice summary of what might be happening. And it naturally creates a lot of stories. If the probability of a candidate winning an election moves from 55 to 50 [percent], well, maybe that could be a whole cycle of stories about what happened, why that probability changed, and what could be the origin. And so, I think the initial forecasts of Nate Silver and the attention that they seemed to garner really led to a lot of news outlets thinking this would be a good way to center their campaign coverage.\n\nIn your paper, you and your colleagues distinguish poll-based probabilistic forecasts from fundamentals-based forecasts, like Allan Lichtman's. What's the difference between the two? And how has each of them done in recent years?\n\nSo, poll-based is, as I've described, making an attempt to find all the polling that's been done and aggregate those polls together. Usually, they'll try to weight polls they think are more accurate so that you're not giving too much credibility or too much credence to a poll that hasn't done well in previous elections. And then based on that information, we'll try to project a potential winner.\n\nFundamental-based forecasts are forecasts that look at things like the unemployment rate or the growth in the economy in an election year. And they ask, historically, what's the relationship been between, say, first-quarter growth in an election year? And, ultimately, who's going to win the election or third-quarter growth? And who's going to win the election? And, historically, there is a nice relationship between things like growth and unemployment and who wins the election. It's not an iron law. There's lots of variability around that election.\n\nSo, in recent years, it's been hit and miss. So, obviously, Nate Silver seemingly is this soothsayer in 2008 and 2012. It looks like he's the best predictor around. 2016, it's a different story for these probabilistic forecasters. Some forecasters who started in 2016 only were on record as saying there's a 99 percent chance that Clinton is going to win. Nate Silver had a more modest prediction: 60/40 but still ultimately had made that forecast that Clinton would win. And I think many of us were surprised the day after the election to find that Trump was the winner.\n\nIn 2020, Nate Silver and some competing forecasts got it correct. They forecasted that Biden would win with some differences in the probability of victory. These forecasters also try to forecast things like midterms. In 2022, Nate Silver made a forecast that had a pro-Republican bias and thought there would be more Republican seats won than were. I think that's not surprising given where the polling data was. And I think, again, a lot of us were surprised at those election results.\n\nWe in our paper make a comparison across the two different kinds of models, not necessarily the Lichtman model but other political science style models. And what we find is that it's certainly true, based on things like vote share, that Nate Silver did better in 2008 and 2012. In the last two presidential elections, again, just based on those two elections, it looks like fundamentals might be doing better. But a core point of our paper is that if we really want to know who's better at picking the winner, it's going to take a long time to sort that out.\n\nAs you said, Nate Silver came to prominence in 2008 after his model predicted the outcomes of 49 of the 50 states in the presidential election that year. But you and your colleagues write of \u201cpredictive failures\u201d and \u201cgrowing evidence of harm\u201d from forecasts. So, which failures? What harm?\n\nI think, the clearest failure of these predictions is 2016, where the predictions that came out of these models were very confident to medium confident that Clinton was going to win. Certainly, the consensus view across the models was a Clinton victory. And that didn't come to pass. And so, they fundamentally got that election wrong. When we think about harm, it's interesting to think about how these models are being consumed by the public.\n\nOne of the things that seems to have emerged is that some people will confuse the probability of a candidate winning with that candidate's vote share. And so, the best evidence that we have from this comes from a paper by Sean Westwood, Solomon Messing, and Yphtach Lelkes, who examine in a set of lab experiments, where they can control a lot of the different pieces of information available\u2014they show that participants in these lab experiments do regularly confuse the probability of a candidate winning with the share of votes that candidate is expected to win.\n\nThis is a problem they show in the context of these experiments because, as a result of this confusion, some people will disengage from these elections where they would have incentive to participate to help their side win. Translated to the real world, that means that there's a risk that people consuming these probabilistic election forecasts may conclude the election's already decided. It's a foregone conclusion. I don't need to participate. I can just go about my day. I don't need to take the time out to vote. And I think that's a real mistake. I think that would be a real harm if these forecasts were causing people to disengage from the political process.\n\nI'll add just one other note about a different version of harm. Another colleague of mine, Eitan Hersh, has a book called Politics Is for Power. One of the points he makes in that book is that people should participate in politics and actively pursue what they want to see by active engagement. The risk with these probabilistic forecasts is it continues this horse race coverage of politics so that people are relieving their anxiety by consulting these probabilities, rather than relieving their anxiety by knocking on doors or calling friends or advocating for the candidate that they really want to see win. And insomuch as it's channeling effort away from the actual practice of politics, I think that's a concern.\n\nThe concerns you've mentioned about the impact of probabilistic forecasts on political participation\u2014it seems to me that you could say them about polling in general. And if that's the case, should there just not be any polls?\n\nI very much like free speech. So, I would not advocate for any sort of ban on polling. I think a lot of this comes down to responsibility at media outlets, journalists, and other individuals who are producing these assessments. I think polls can be very valuable. In fact, there's an argument to be made. They're a core component of what helps us be a responsive representative of democracy is that we have polls. Politicians can know what people want. And they can be responsive to that. So, I certainly wouldn't want to advocate for getting rid of polls.\n\nWhat I do think journalists could do a much better job of and what forecasters could do a better job of is appropriately framing their analysis. They can offer a characteristic of what the current state of the race is. They could say, \u201cThis is where the current share of votes are. This is who's currently supporting the candidate or not.\u201d I think it's another thing entirely to say, \u201cThis is the probability of this candidate winning.\u201d That's a big difference from what's going on in previous polls.\n\nAnd those probabilities resonate with people in a different way. If you're telling me it's a 95 percent chance my candidate's going to win, that's different than you telling me that my candidate is up by a lot in a particular state. So, I think that probability is a real point of distinction. And I think as with many things in life, it's a question about responsibly using them rather than the wholesale elimination or regulation of them.\n\nThe core of the argument in your paper seems to be that we simply don't have enough data points to determine whether these forecasts of presidential elections are accurate or at least more accurate than random guesses. Some of that has to do with the infrequency of elections. Some of that has to do with the nature and the quantity of information from the state results. Can you unpack each of these criticisms?\n\nAs you mentioned, at the very heart of our argument is that there are simply not enough presidential elections to evaluate these forecasts.\n\nSo, here's the thought experiment that our paper is really based on. Let's suppose we have two rival forecasters. One forecaster is fitting a very sophisticated model. Another forecaster, unbeknownst to everyone, is really just flipping a coin. Now, they may put a lot of window dressing on what that forecast looks like. They may write some elaborate scheme that tells them how they're making their choice. But really, at the end of the day, they're just secretly flipping the coin. The question we ask in our paper is, how long would we need to observe these election forecasts in order to differentiate these two forecasters to reveal that one forecaster is the sophisticated forecaster with lots of information like we see from Silver? Or is it someone who's just flipping the coin?\n\nAnd so, our calculations are fundamentally focusing, at least at first, on the national winner, which is the big thing that forecasters want to pick. They want to be able to tell you who is going to win the presidential election. And when we focus on those, it turns out, depending on how much more skilled the real forecaster is, it can take anywhere between decades to centuries because we just need to observe enough election results in order to be able to differentiate the two.\n\nEvery once in a while, the coin-flipping forecaster\u2014or half the time probably\u2014the coin-flipping forecaster is going to agree with the real forecaster. And we can't tell them apart in those years. It's only in the years where there's some differentiation and the skilled forecaster comes out on top that we'd be able to tell the two apart.\n\nPerhaps people can use information from the states in order to do a better job of evaluating these forecasts. I think there are two important facts there. So, first, it is the case that we could require forecasters to make state-level results. And we could say we only want to consider forecasts that are picking an overall winner and then give us something like state-level vote share. But performing well at state-level vote share is different and does not imply that you're doing a good job of picking the winner.\n\nSuppose I have a forecasting model and it is superb at nailing the vote share in California and Wyoming and in North Dakota, these sorts of states, very lopsided states, Alabama. It is going to get this down. We know DC very precisely. And then we would say, wow, this is an excellent model. It's done very good at vote share. But, fundamentally, to pick the winner, we need a very precise estimate of vote share in the small set of swing states that are going to determine the winner.\n\nSo, even if you had done well at vote share in 2016 or 2020, at the end of the day, the question is, do you get Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, correct? And if you don't get those correct, it's not going to matter that you nail to the wall the California vote share or the Alabama vote share. You really have to get those states right.\n\nAnd so, that's how you can have this breakdown between the state-level results and picking the overall winner. And so, it would be, I think, a mistake to rely too much on those state-level results. Really focusing on this national level is how we could differentiate someone like Nate Silver from someone like Allan Lichtman to someone who's just by happenstance making these sorts of forecasts.\n\nYou've gotten some pushback from Silver on social media. He calls academics slow compared to the efficient market and says they can't model. So, what is he missing?\n\nI think the big point that we're making is that you evaluate a forecast, at least its historical track record, on the events that you are forecasting. If I say that there's going to be rain this evening, I think any reasonable person would evaluate that forecast based on whether there was, in fact, rain this evening. If I'm going to make a claim about someone who's going to win the presidential election, I will evaluate that based on who wins the US presidency. And academics and private sector and everyone else are getting that information at the exact same rate. It's going to be every four years on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Well, we'll get the votes in and then, hopefully, shortly thereafter know who's going to be the winner.\n\nSo, everyone's subject to that same rate of learning. We could add in different assumptions about how these other forecasts feed into our evaluation. But, fundamentally, if we're going to make the claim, \u201cI'm good at picking the US presidency,\u201d you would want to see results from picking the US presidency. So, that's what he seems to be missing.\n\nThe data journalist G. Elliott Morris, the head of ABC's 538 election forecasting team, had a thoughtful critique of your paper. He wrote, \"I think the problem is that they're evaluating each election outcome as binary. But some elections have more information than others. Predicting 1984 or 1996,\" which were very lopsided elections, obviously, \"as a coin flip would be ridiculous. The key here is that forecasters predict the popular and electoral vote margins, not just the winner.\" So, how do you and your colleagues respond to Morris's points?\n\nThere are a few points to be made here. We show in the paper that even if you want to distinguish between rival forecasters\u2014things like 538 or Morris's old model, which was at The Economist or other prediction models\u2014in that realm, even if we're looking at something like Electoral College vote, that's going to take a really long time because these models are all so similar, you would have to see some differences across these models. That's going to take many, many elections. But I think there is this same basic idea.\n\nEven if we wanted to use something like margin\u2014and we think if we get the margin correct, we're going to be better at picking the winner, or we think it's about vote share and if we get we do a better job at vote share, we'd be better at picking the winner\u2014the way we would evaluate that claim, at least historically, is we'd say, \u201cWell, is it the case that our models that are better at predicting vote share, better at predicting the electoral college, are also more accurate in selecting the winner of the presidential election?\u201d\n\nAnd what you confront immediately when you realize that is that you will learn that relationship at the same rate that we're all learning this relationship, which is once every four years, we'll get the winner of that election. And so, we might say, data free\u2014before I look at data, I just prefer models that have been more accurate historically on the electoral college or more accurate on vote share. And I think that's fine. I think we'd also want to be very clear that we don't know that those models that have been more accurate on electoral college or vote share historically are any better at picking the winner than a model that has more inaccuracy in those other targets.\n\nMorris also writes that political professionals, journalists, and gamblers are going to make probabilistic forecasts one way or another. Fundamentals-based models exist. Polls exist. Given that this information is going to be combined in some way, he says, \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any shame in trying to do it well.\u201d So, does he have a point? Are we stuck with probabilistic forecasts? And if we are, should we at least try and go about them as best we can?\n\nJust as a matter of logic and historical record, there's absolutely no reason forecasts, as they're currently instantiated, need to exist. They didn't exist for a long time in US political history. They could go away and my guess is we'd probably be OK. In fact, I think some of the evidence I've already discussed would suggest that we might be better off if they did go away. And so, their usefulness is a question that I think could still be debated, hardly settled science but certainly a debate worth having.\n\nI do agree with Morris that, given that it would happen, there's a way in which we could convey the information out of these models better. I think better transparency about what's going in, better transparency about what conclusions are based on the data that's being inputted, and what conclusions are based on assumptions would be really helpful for the public in informing how much they should trust these forecasts. And I think, certainly, it would be helpful for knowing how journalists should approach them.\n\nAnd then the last thing Morris said is, \u201cWell, we should do it well.\u201d And that's an appeal that resonates with me. It's like, \u201cWell, we're going to do something. Let's work hard at it. Let's try to do it as well as we can.\u201d But I think it's useful for us to think about what doing well means.\n\nAnd so, certainly, we can think about applying reasonable statistical standards when crafting our models and being sufficiently transparent about the assumptions that we give and, even as some forecasters will suggest, looking at the results and making sure that they pass some face validity check. Those things are all reasonable. And I agree with Morris. You want to engage in that effort.\n\nBut there's a different way to think about what it means to do well. And that would be, \u201cAre these models with all these reasonable assumptions and best statistical practices in face validity\u2014are they any good at picking the winner?\u201d\n\nAnd I don't mean to sound repetitive here. But to do that, that's going to take a long time to assess. And so, whether or not the best practice statistical procedures manifest in being a very accurate election forecaster picking the winner will take a long time to figure out. And maybe we'll never know.\n\nAll right, so, finally, come on now, who do you think is going to win in November?\n\nThat's a hilarious question. In March, if you would have asked me, I would have said, this is going to be a very close contest that will come down to who will win a collection of swing states. We've had one candidate survive a near-assassination attempt. We have another candidate totally drop out of the race. We had two historic debates really unlike any other we've seen in American political history, with wild accusations from both candidates. And as we sit here today, I think the best summary of what's going to happen is this is going to be a very closely contested election. And the winner is going to be whoever is going to be able to secure this small collection of swing states.",

Restorative Justice International (RJI) takes that stand today.\n\nThe rise of the far right has darkened the path of democracies globally. Among the world\u2019s 193 nations, some 22 nations* have either currently elected a far right, populist leader, or have done so in recent years, or are increasingly open to the views of the far right. The U.S. election for the presidency with former President Trump running as the Republican nominee is certainly of grave concern to RJI, particularly since his world views have emboldened politicians globally. By electing such politicians, communities suffer by dividing people and causing discord. It is important that far right, populist politicians never become \u201cnormalized\u201d in any civilized society.\n\nIncreasingly global populist leaders are targeting and demonizing immigrants while often blaming them for crime and violence that they did not commit. RJI condemns those who use hateful rhetoric which blame others for violence and crime they did not cause. We stand by those victims of this hateful rhetoric. The truth is the first victim of the far right\u2019s political vision.\n\nBecause democratic nations are critical to the administration of justice, RJI calls for nations to embrace leaders who are committed to democratic values including truth and restorative justice. Restorative justice that is victims-centered brings healing to communities while holding offenders accountable after violence or crime. The foundation of restorative justice is truth, and truth telling. Truthful dialogue between people is required when working to bring peace and stability to all nations, first starting in communities.\n\nRestorative Justice International (RJI) is an association and network of over 7200 members and Affiliates with a robust 19-member Global Advisory Council. RJI is committed to victims-driven restorative justice, systemic justice reform, and human rights.

        "text": "Exhibit explores American traditions of protest and discourse\nA new campus exhibit and speaker series at the University of Arizona explores America's history of protests and civil discourse.\n\nThe free exhibit, \"You Say You Want a Revolution: Politics and Art in the 1960s,\" is on display now through March on the lower level of the Campus Store at the Student Union Memorial Center. The display provides a timeline of political protests in America during the 1960s and '70s, covering the Civil Rights Movement, the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr., and the election of President Richard M. Nixon. It also includes campaign memorabilia and other political artifacts from the period.\n\nThe exhibit comes from the Museum of Democracy, based at Long Island University in New York. The university's Center for the Philosophy of Freedom, also known as the Freedom Center, brought the exhibit to the Campus Store in partnership with the museum and the Arizona Board of Regents' Presidential Project, a civic education program designed to foster knowledge of the American presidencies and presidential elections among undergraduate students, high school students and the broader community.\n\n\"We are grateful to be part of a university and a state that values fostering opportunities for civil discourse, especially during times when such conversations can be more challenging,\" said Saura Masconale, associate director of the Freedom Center. \"This is the mission of the Freedom Center \u2013 to serve as a university-wide forum for healthy disagreement, a space where people can come together to discuss differing views without ending up hating each other.\"\n\nThe exhibit coincides with a conversation series that begins on Oct. 8 with a discussion between Cornel West, a philosopher who is running for U.S. president as an independent, and Robert George, director of the James Madison Program in American Ideals and Institutions at Princeton University. The two will discuss American values, protests and civil disagreement. Jay Nordlinger, editor of the National Review, will moderate.\n\nThe free, public event will begin at 5:30 p.m. in the lower level of the Campus Store. Registration is required.\n\nThe second event in the series, on Oct. 24, will feature Johanna Maska, former press aide to President Barack Obama, and Sean Spicer, former press secretary for President Donald Trump. The two will discuss bridging the country's political divide ahead of the U.S. election. The talk begins at 7 p.m. in Environment and Natural Resources 2, Room S107.",

        "text": "Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are deadlocked\nTrump and Harris are deadlocked - could an October surprise change the game?\n\nReuters\n\nWith one month to election day, the contest between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris is the electoral equivalent of a bare-knuckle brawl. The race for the White House still appears deadlocked, both nationally and in battleground states, so victory will be decided by the slimmest of margins - every new voter engaged, every undecided voter swayed, could help land a knock-out punch. \u201cIn any super close race, where the electorate is divided down the middle, a difference of a percentage point or two could be decisive,\u201d says David Greenberg, a presidential historian at Rutgers University. While party strategists are focused on how to earn that decisive edge, it could just as easily be an event out of their control, an unexpected twist, that upends the campaign in the final weeks. It\u2019s already been a year of political shockwaves - from one candidate surviving two assassination attempts and being convicted of a crime, to another, President Joe Biden, dropping out of the race in favour of his much younger vice-president. However, when the surprises drop in October - think Trump\u2019s Access Hollywood tape or Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails in 2016 - there is scarcely time left to recover or regain momentum after a misstep or bad news cycle. This week alone, there were several new rumbles that could turn into political storms by 5 November.\n\nHelene\u2019s political fallout\n\nGetty Images North Carolina, which has been devastated by Hurricane Helene, is a must-win state for Trump\n\nThe first potential political storm was a literal one. Hurricane Helene tore through two key electoral battlegrounds last week, Georgia and North Carolina. Because of the intense focus on both states during this presidential race, a humanitarian disaster, with a death toll already over 200, has also become a political issue. Harris pledged long-term aid to the region at a stop in Georgia earlier this week, and visited those affected by the storm in North Carolina on Saturday. \"We're here for the long haul,\" she said in Georgia. Meanwhile, both states are essentially must-wins for Trump, and polls show a dead heat. While visiting Georgia, the former president claimed that Americans were losing out on emergency relief money because it had been spent on migrants. In fact, the two distinct programmes have separate budgets, and the Biden administration accused Republicans of spreading \"bold-faced lies\" about funding for the disaster response. When disaster strikes, it's not easy for the government to keep everyone happy. If Trump\u2019s attacks land, any voter dissatisfaction with recovery efforts could potentially impact the result in two of the most closely-watched states in the country.\n\nEscalation in the Middle East\n\nThousands of miles from the disaster-ravaged American southeast, a manmade crisis continues to inject itself into American politics. The Gaza war is in danger of expanding into a regional conflagration, as Israeli forces fought Hezbollah forces in southern Lebanon and Iran launched hundreds of missiles at Israel earlier this week. While Harris has presented herself as a candidate of change, she put no distance between herself and the current administration when it comes to US-Israeli policies. That comes with risks. Hopes for any kind of pre-election ceasefire in Gaza appear firmly dashed, and the White House at this point is trying to ensure that the inevitable Israeli response to Tuesday\u2019s Iranian strike doesn\u2019t lead to all-out war. On Thursday night, Biden was not exactly reassuring. \u201cI don\u2019t believe there\u2019s going to be an all-out war,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we can avoid it. But there\u2019s a lot to do yet.\u201d The war is also having consequences at home for Democrats, even if American voters usually don\u2019t think directly about foreign policy when they cast their ballots. Harris\u2019s commitment to continue supplying arms to Israel is a problem for two key segments of the Democratic base: Arab-Americans in the must-win state of Michigan, and young voters on campuses, where anti-war protests could start up again. The conflict in the Middle East has also fuelled pocketbook concerns. Biden\u2019s mention of the possibility that Israel would target Iranian refineries caused the price of oil to jump more than 5% on Thursday. If there\u2019s one thing that American consumers are particularly sensitive to, it's higher prices at the petrol pump.\n\nPleasant surprises for Democrats\n\nAcross the board, public opinion surveys continue to show that the economy is the top issue for American voters. And Harris and the Democrats received some good news on that front on Friday, with the latest employment figures showing robust job growth over the past few months and an unemployment level that dropped to 4.1%. According to Mr Greenberg, however, voter concerns on the economy are about more than the latest job figures. \u201cWhen people complain about the economy, what they\u2019re really complaining about is the longer-term failure in certain parts of the country - rural America\u2019s de-industrialised communities,\u201d he says. \u201cThose are parts of the country that are hurting even in a good economy.\u201d For most of the election season, Trump has fared better than Harris when voters are asked who they think would do a better job with the economy, including in a recent CNN poll. But there are signs his lead may not be set in stone, such as a Cook Political Report survey of swing states that showed the two candidates tied on who would be best at dealing with inflation. One looming economic pitfall for Democrats also evaporated this week - the dockworkers strike, which had briefly shut down critical ports on the East Coast and the Gulf of Mexico for the first time in 50 years. Both parties agreed to return to the bargaining table in January, reopening the ports. If a work stoppage had continued, it could have disrupted supply chains and driven up consumer prices in the weeks before the election. Meanwhile, undocumented crossings at the US-Mexico border have returned to pre-Covid pandemic levels, after hitting a record high of 249,741 last December. While the impact of that border surge is still being felt in many American cities, the urgency of the crisis may be diminishing.\n\nCapitol riot resurfaces\n\nWhile much of this week\u2019s news could spell trouble for Harris and the Democrats, it wasn\u2019t all smooth sailing for Trump. His conduct during the 6 January attack on the US Capitol once again came into focus on Wednesday, when a federal judge released a document from special counsel Jack Smith outlining his case and evidence against Donald Trump for trying to overturn the 2020 election result. The document, which argued that the former president should not be given presidential immunity from prosecution, contained new details about Trump\u2019s words and actions leading up to the Capitol riot by his supporters. A recent CNN poll shows that voters favour Harris over Trump on issues of \u201cprotecting democracy\u201d by 47% to 40% - so anything that renews attention on the chaotic final weeks of Trump\u2019s presidency could be to the Democrat\u2019s advantage.\n\nUnknown unknowns\n\nThe term \u201cOctober surprise\u201d has been a fixture in American political lexicon for nearly 50 years. Campaigns dread the unexpected headline or crisis that pushes their candidates off message and changes the trajectory of a race. Even the smallest ripple in public opinion might deliver the White House in a year when the electoral margins in the swing states could be measured in only tens of thousands of votes. November\u2019s balloting, says Mr Greenberg, is shaping up to be a nail-biter. \u201cI don\u2019t have any fingernails left,\u201d he says. \u201cI could totally imagine this election going either way with extremely significant consequences riding on that vote no matter where your loyalty is.\u201d",

        "text": "2024 U.S. Presidential Election: Environmental policy\nVice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, the two main U.S. 2024 presidential candidates, have expressed vastly different ideologies regarding climate change, environmental policy and renewable energy. America is second only to China as the world\u2019s largest sources of greenhouse gasses, so November\u2019s election results will greatly influence the trajectory of energy production and climate change mitigation in the coming years.\n\nKamala Harris (D)\n\nHarris has long championed environmental initiatives. As California Attorney General, she took on Big Oil numerous times and blocked an Obama administration plan to expand fracking to the Pacific Ocean. Currently, Harris and the Democratic Party refer to climate change as a \u201cglobal emergency\u201d and have committed to helping America reach net zero emissions no later than 2050 through policy programs like the Green New Deal and international treaties such as the Paris Clean Energy Agreement.\n\nAs vice president in 2022, Harris cast the tie breaking vote for the largest environmental investment in U.S. history: The Biden administration\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). By allocating billions of dollars to take on the climate crisis, the IRA reduced renewable energy costs nationwide. Scientists predict the policy will reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 40% by 2030, which is a vast stride towards the Democratic party\u2019s goal of net zero emissions.\n\nHarris also helped the Biden administration create the Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights, which will provide aid to disadvantaged communities impacted by climate change. Although the new office is outfitted with staff members and resources, President Joe Biden has not yet assigned a Senate-confirmed leader to the program. If elected, Harris is expected to complete this task early on in her term.\n\nMore recently in her presidential campaign, Harris has taken a slightly more conservative environmental policy position, the most notable of which being her shifting opinion on hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.\n\nFracking is a method of natural gas extraction that emits greenhouse gases and contributes to air and water pollution. Consequently, fracking exacerbates climate change and threatens surrounding plant and animal populations.\n\nAlthough Harris supported a national fracking ban during her 2019 presidential campaign, in a recent interview with CNN she remarked, \u201cWe can increase a clean energy economy without banning fracking.\u201d She also made this intention clear during her last debate with Trump.\n\nDespite this recent fracking opinion development, many national environmental organizations, including the League of Conservation Voters, Clean Energy for American Action and the Sierra Club, have endorsed Harris\u2019 presidential campaign. \u201cThe Biden-Harris administration has done far more to address the climate crisis and environmental injustice than any administration in our nation\u2019s history,\u201d the Sierra Club report stated, suggesting that Harris\u2019 past political involvements have earned her the trust and support of climate-focused voters.\n\nThis may include 68.5% of Advanced Placement U.S. Government (AP Gov) students at Foothill Technology High School (Foothill Tech) who rated the importance of domestic green energy investment as an 8, 9 or 10 out of 10.\n\nDonald Trump (R)\n\nTrump\u2019s opinions and policies concerning climate change starkly contrast those of Harris. He has repeatedly referred to the Green New Deal as the \u201cGreen New Scam\u201d and overturned an estimated 100 environmental regulations during his time as president. However, the Trump campaign emphasizes that during the former president\u2019s last term, jobs were created, energy was reliable and U.S. carbon emissions declined.\n\nAlso as president, Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement due to \u201cthe unfair economic burden imposed on American workers, businesses, and taxpayers by U.S. pledges made under the Agreement,\u201d according to the U.S. Department of State. Although Biden signed the papers to re-join the treaty on his first day of office in 2020, if Trump is elected in November, it is predicted that he will withdraw the U.S. yet again.\n\nTrump\u2019s presidential campaign is largely centered around restoring America\u2019s energy independence, as detailed in his Agenda47 plan. To do this, Trump is planning to invest in fossil fuel based energy production, as expressed by his token phrase:\u201cDrill Baby Drill\u201d.\n\nNotably, only 17.8% of AP Gov students at Foothill Tech would be willing to pay more for green energy as opposed to non-renewable sources, and Trump\u2019s promises may appeal to voters who would prefer lower energy costs regardless of source.\n\nTrump also vows to \u201cstop the wave of frivolous litigation from environmental extremists,\u201d as stated in Agenda47. In essence, Trump does not acknowledge climate change as a prominent threat to the U.S., as he is primarily focused on \u201cAmerica first\u201d industrial policy through expansion of non-renewable domestic energy production.",

        "text": "Take a breath regarding the Presidential Election of 2024\nA lot of folks around here are having trouble breathing this year, probably because they\u2019re holding their noses.\n\nThe Presidential Election of 2024 forces America to choose the lesser of two evils. Do we want the childish egomaniac or the socialist flip-flopper? The apparent liar, or the one who can\u2019t seem to put a complete sentence together? The prolific mean-tweeter or the candidate who seems anything but tech-savvy? The candidate no one knows much about or the candidate we know all too well? Hold your nose and make your pick, but you may not be very happy with the choice.\n\nIt\u2019s discouraging, that in a nation of 330 million people, these are the 2 best candidates the political parties can offer. I agree with a commentator who, after watching a debate said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure who won, but I think the American people lost!\u201d\n\nNations have faced bad choices in the past. After King Solomon died, Rehoboam, his son, was the king-apparent. The people of Israel, however, were tired of supporting Solomon\u2019s domestic infrastructure agenda through high taxes so, before anointing Rehoboam as King, they asked him to lessen the tax burden. Rehoboam consulted with his older, more experienced advisors, and they advised him to cut taxes and win the favor of the people. But when Rehoboam asked his friends to weigh-in on the issue, they encouraged him to be tough and let people know who\u2019s in charge, to take control before things get out of hand. Rehoboam listened to the young men and told the nation, \u201cMy little finger is thicker than my father\u2019s waist. My father laid on you a heavy yoke; I will make it even heavier. My father scourged you with whips; I will scourge you with scorpions\u201d (1 Kings 12:10-11, NIV).\n\nJeroboam, who had served capably in Solomon\u2019s cabinet, had a mixed history with Solomon and his family. The prophet Ahijah had predicted that Jeroboam would eventually rule over the majority of Solomon\u2019s kingdom, prompting Solomon to see Jeroboam as a rival to be eliminated, forcing Jeroboam to flee to Egypt for safety. Then, angered by Rehoboam\u2019s response to their request for tax cuts, many of the people of Israel welcomed Jeroboam back from exile and rallied behind him as their new king. As a result, the kingdom split. Some followed Rehoboam, but most people followed Jeroboam.\n\nWhich King should Israel pick, the out-of-touch idiot or the know-it-all hothead? The stubborn, spoiled son of royalty, or the leader who would take them into civil war?\n\nThe positive side of this bad-politician conundrum is the fact that human leaders don\u2019t have the final say. Whether there\u2019s a Democrat or a Republican in the White House, there\u2019s still a King on Heaven\u2019s throne. Nothing surprises Him and nothing lies beyond His control. There\u2019s no wrong He can\u2019t right, no situation He can\u2019t handle and no sin He can\u2019t forgive. God determined the destiny of nations millennia before America separated itself from King George, and He\u2019s been in charge of death and disease since the Garden of Eden. God knows your needs before you ask and He\u2019s promised to be with us always. In a world of change and uncertainty, He\u2019s dependable and capable.\n\nProverbs 21:1 (ESV) says \u201cThe king\u2019s heart is a stream of water in the hand of the LORD; he turns it wherever he will.\u201d God is ultimately in charge of events, even when incompetent or evil people seem to take charge. Pharoah, you\u2019ll remember, was determined not to let the people of Israel leave Egyptian slavery; but the Lord changed his mind. And when Pharoah reneged and tried to force Israel back into captivity, the Lord defended Israel and Pharoah\u2019s army drowned. Pharoah might have been the most powerful man in the world, but he was still man and God was still God.\n\nThat\u2019s our consolation in a sorry election year. Politicians don\u2019t determine the quality of our lives as much as they often promise that they can, but even when they change the world, they don\u2019t decide our final destiny. So, as Paul instructs in 1 Timothy 2:1-2, let\u2019s pray for those in positions of leadership so that we can \u201clead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way.\u201d Let\u2019s \u201cbe subject to the governing authorities\u201d (Romans 13:1). But most of all, let\u2019s remember that God is Sovereign. Residents of the White House come and go, but God remains on His throne.\n\nBreathe.",

        "text": "How US election outcome could affect the Western Balkans \u2013 DW \u2013 10\nAs the US presidential election approaches, the countries in the Balkans \u2014 in particular Serbia and Kosovo \u2014 are watching closely. What impact will the election outcome have on this corner of southeastern Europe?\n\nOn September 23, Donald Trump's oldest son, Donald Jr., sat down to dinner with Serbian businesspeople in Belgrade to discuss investment opportunities.\n\nThis was not a first for the Trump family: The former president's contacts to Serbian entrepreneurs and government representatives go as far back as 2013.\n\nAt the time, Ivica Dacic, then prime minister of Serbia, spoke publicly of Trump's interest in a real estate project.\n\nThe object in question was the former headquarters of the Yugoslav People's Army, which was seriously damaged in the NATO bombardment of 1999. But the negotiations came to nothing.\n\nThen, in May of this year, Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, led by the former US ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, sealed the deal. The billion-dollar contract includes a 99-year lease on the complex.\n\nSerbian President Aleksandar Vucic (right) presented former US Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell (left) with the Order of the Serbian Flag in 2023 Image: Darko Vojinovic/dpa/picture alliance\n\nGrenell is seen as a likely candidate for the post of secretary of state, should Trump win the presidential election in November. He was considered the most unpopular postwar US ambassador in Berlin during his time at the embassy. The Swiss daily newspaper Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung went as far as to call him an \"undiplomat\" because of his \"loutish behavior.\"\n\nDonald Trump Jr. recently praised him as the \"top contender for secretary of state.\"\n\nTrump's failed Balkan course\n\nAs Trump's special envoy for the Balkans, it was Grenell who pulled the strings in 2020 when Kosovo Prime Minister Albin Kurti was ousted because he stood in the way of another deal.\n\nThe agreement in question was allegedly about a territorial exchange along ethnic lines between Serbia and Kosovo. In June 2020, the then-president of Kosovo, Hashim Thaci, and Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic wanted to meet Trump in the White House to sign the agreement.\n\nAccording to reports, the agreement would have seen the four predominantly ethnic Serb communities in northern Kosovo becoming part of Serbia. In return, the predominantly ethnic Albanian Presevo Valley in southern Serbia would have become part of Kosovo.\n\nA land swap such as this could have had a domino effect in the region because the states of the Western Balkans are all still largely multiethnic.\n\nBosnian-Serb leader Milorad Dodik had already threatened that were the land exchange to take place, the Republika Srpska \u2014 the predominantly Serb part of Bosnia and Herzegovina \u2014 would join Serbia.\n\nThis could have led to a new Balkan war, with the ethnically motivated redrawing of borders harboring huge potential for conflict.\n\nBut Trump's plans were frustrated by an indictment against President Thaci from the Kosovo Tribunal in The Hague. Thaci handed himself over to the court.\n\nMeanwhile, Grenell's enduring popularity in Serbia is illustrated by the fact that Marko Duric, Serbia's ambassador to the US, recently said Grenell was \"undoubtedly Serbia's friend.\"\n\nIn 2023, Vucic presented Grenell with the country's highest order in recognition of his advocacy for Serbia, justifying his decision by saying \"I think he is one of the few people from the US who has a balanced approach to Kosovo.\"\n\nWhat would a Harris victory mean for the region?\n\nTrump's pro-Serbia stance hints at what the Western Balkans could expect if the Republican were to be returned to the White House in November.\n\nThe line taken by Democratic Party candidate Kamala Harris, on the other hand, has not so far been as clear cut. Nevertheless, some conclusions can be drawn on the basis of both her personal background and foreign policy views.\n\nIt is considered unlikely that Harris would favor Serbian nationalists or any other ethnonationalists. In addition, Harris's pro-Ukraine stance is well-documented.\n\nIt is possible that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has warned her of Moscow's alleged plans to destabilize the Balkans or to open up new fronts there with the help of pro-Moscow irredentist Serbian nationalists.\n\nThe close ties between Belgrade and Moscow could push Harris to change America's course.\n\nUS 'needs to be tougher with Serbia'\n\nEdward Joseph, a conflict researcher at the renowned Johns Hopkins University, recently criticized that the Biden administration had \"cozied up\" to Serbia.\n\nIt's unlikely that Harris would favor Serbian or any other ethnonationalists if elected US president Image: J. Scott Applewhite/dpa/AP/picture alliance\n\nHe went on to say that Vucic has shifted Belgrade's orientation ever eastwards and that there was no reason why Harris, if elected, should continue Biden's unsuccessful policy.\n\nFormer US diplomat Shaun Byrnes took the same line, recommending that the US needs to be \"tougher with Serbia because it continues to have a hostile approach toward Kosovo.\"\n\nBiden's 'fantasy diplomacy' in the Balkans\n\nDaniel Serwer, a veteran diplomat who has worked with Richard Holbrooke, the architect of the 1995 Dayton Peace Agreement for Bosnia and Herzegovina, has described Biden's Balkans policy as \"fantasy diplomacy.\"\n\nIn Serwer's eyes, to build up Vucic, the man who was Slobodan Milosevic's propaganda minister in the 1990s, as an anchor of stability was far removed from reality.\n\nThe frequent visits to Moscow by Vucic ally and Serbian deputy premier Aleksandar Vulin, who recently assured Russian President Vladimir Putin in person that Serbia is \"Russia's strategic partner and ally,\" have cast doubt on the US Balkans policy.\n\nThe activities of members of Trump's circle in Belgrade have shown that if the former president is reelected in November, economic objectives will be at the forefront of America's Western Balkans policy in the future.\n\nThe fact that Vucic has excellent relations with Putin suits Trump down to the ground.\n\nConcern about a possible second Trump administration\n\nFor Ukraine, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo and Montenegro, however, all of this is alarming. Because although Bosnia and Kosovo are two clearly pro-American, pro-Western states with Muslim majority populations, they cannot automatically rely on US protection against Serbia's expansionist cravings if Trump is reelected.\n\nSerbia's President Aleksandar Vucic (right) enjoys excellent relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin (left) Image: picture-alliance/TASS/M. Metzel\n\nTrump has shown in the past that he has no qualms about dropping allies if it suits his agenda.\n\nIn December 2018, for example, he announced he would be withdrawing most US troops from Syria. In so doing, he betrayed the Kurds, who had done most of the fighting on the ground in the battle against the so-called \"Islamic State.\" This betrayal of allies led the then-US Defense Secretary James Mattis to resign.\n\nBefore Grenell's Serbia-Kosovo swap land deal collapsed, Trump had threatened Kosovo Prime Minister Kurti on a number of occasions that he would withdraw US troops from Kosovo. The presence of these troops is seen as a life insurance policy for Kosovo, whose independence Serbia does not recognize.\n\nWhether NATO's KFOR troops could guarantee Kosovo's security without the Americans is at the very least questionable.\n\nBut the Biden administration would appear to have taken at least one precaution in this respect: The US has supplied Kosovo with 250 Javelin anti-tank missiles, which it also sent to Ukraine. Turkey has also supplied its Bayraktar drones, which are no less effective.\n\nWithout these two weapons systems, Ukraine would no longer exist as an independent state.\n\nKosovo, incidentally, does not have any combat tanks \u2014 unlike Serbia, which has about 250. In short, the number of Javelins supplied by the US was certainly no coincidence.\n\nAlexander Rhotert is a political scientist and author.

Red = new code to be enacted\n\nHOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 203\n\n(By Delegates Ridenour, Mazzocchi, Dillon, Longanacre, Coop-Gonzalez, Foster, Foggin, Steele, and Butler)\n\n[Introduced October 6, 2024; referred\n\nto the Committee on the Judiciary.]\n\nRequesting that the West Virginia Legislature shall not recognize an illegitimate presidential election.\n\nWhereas, a Constitutionally valid government only exists and endures when elections are conducted in accordance with all applicable legal requirements and are free of violence or threats of violence, government manipulation, censorship, coercion, fraudulent voting, or manipulation of votes, election tabulation, and/or election results by any means whatsoever; and that\n\nWhereas, in the 2024 election cycle there have been, to date, two assassination attempts on the Republican nominee for President of the United States while threats of assassination of the Republican nominees for president and vice president abound. The federal government, under the current Democrat-led regime, has utterly failed, and continues to fail, in a suspicious manner, in its absolute duty to adequately protect the Republican nominee for president; and that\n\nWhereas, the Constitutions of the United States and the State of West Virginia require that only legal citizens may vote in U.S. and West Virginia elections, and that there is abundant evidence that non-citizens have been and are being registered to vote in the national election of 2024; therefore, be it\n\nResolved by the Legislature of West Virginia:\n\nThat, the sovereign State of West Virginia declares it will not recognize an election for President if such election is enabled by illegal or fraudulent acts; and be it\n\nFurther Resolved, That, the State of West Virginia will not recognize any election of the Democrat candidate for President during the 2024 election cycle if the Republican presidential or vice-presidential candidate is assassinated, seriously injured during an assassination attempt, incarcerated, de facto eliminated or barred from the ballot in any states, or is the subject of legal actions that preclude their effective campaigning; and be it\n\nFurther Resolved, That, the State of West Virginia will not recognize an election of a candidate for President during the 2024 election cycle if the Attorney General of West Virginia or the Secretary of State of West Virginia, in consultation with the West Virginia Legislature, determine that election fraud in any state was a major reason that resulted in a candidate for President obtaining a majority in the Electoral College. Election fraud includes non-citizen voting, vote buying, ballot forgery, illegal or illicit ballot harvesting, illegal or illicit discarding of legal votes or voter registrations, ballot miscounts, algorithmic manipulation of votes or vote tabulations, cyber-attack or manipulation, or intimidation. Election fraud also includes interference by any government entities, including arrests or prosecutions for apparent political motives, or other forms of persecution using legal or official processes, to negatively affect an electoral process, or a political entity participating in an electoral process, using unconstitutional, extraconstitutional, illegal, or otherwise illegitimate means, including those under the color of law or office; and be it\n\nFurther Resolved, That, the State of West Virginia will not recognize an election of a candidate for President, if the Attorney General of West Virginia or the Secretary of State of West Virginia, in consultation with the West Virginia Legislature, determine that election interference by the federal government, foreign governments, or other state governments was a key factor that resulted in a candidate for President obtaining a majority in the Electoral College. Election interference includes censorship, information suppression or manipulation, or other unconstitutional, extraconstitutional, illegal, or otherwise illegitimate actions by the federal government, foreign governments, or other state governments, either directly or in collusion with elements of the media, social media entities, information entities, or political entities; and be it\n\nFurther Resolved, Thereupon a determination by the Legislature of West Virginia, in consultation with the Attorney General and Secretary of State, of either the illegal or illicit elimination of the Republican presidential or vice presidential candidate during the 2024 election cycle; or election fraud or election interference resulting in the Constitutionally illegitimate selection of a President during the 2024 election cycle, the Legislature will be called into special session by the Governor to consider actions to preserve the Freedom of our People.\n\nFurther Resolved, That the Clerk of the House forward a copy of this resolution to the Attorney General of the State of West Virginia, the Secretary of State of West Virginia, and the Governor of West Virginia; and, be it\n\nFurther Resolved, That the Clerk of the House forward a copy of this resolution to the United States Congress.",

        "text": "Can we trust the polls for the US election?\nAsk most party strategists, US pollsters or pundits and they'll tell you the 2024 presidential election could be the closest in decades, if not a century.\n\nGiven Joe Biden's 2020 win was decided by fewer than 45,000 votes in just three battleground states, that's quite the claim.\n\nHowever, it is what the polls suggest. The contest between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump is super tight, both nationally and in the key states.\n\nSo, how much can we trust the polls?\n\nIt's a question many are raising after they famously got it so wrong four years ago.\n\nThe American Association for Public Opinion Research called it the biggest polling miss in 40 years, showing Mr Biden's lead over Mr Trump in the final two weeks of the campaign twice as large as it was when the votes were counted.\n\nIn 2012, pollsters significantly under-estimated Barack Obama's lead over Mitt Romney. But, while Mr Trump's 2016 victory over Hillary Clinton shocked many people, the error on the national polls was relatively small by comparison.\n\nOf course, all polls come with uncertainty, some inbuilt error, and they are only a snapshot of the current situation, not a prediction of the outcome on polling day.\n\nCrucially, though, there is evidence they also become a more reliable predictor of the outcome the closer we get to the election. It may seem obvious, but a year out from voting the polls are on average seven points different from the final tally for each candidate. By the last week of the campaign, this falls to less than three points.\n\nEvery day the polls tell us a little bit more about the result.\n\nSo, how should we read them?\n\nOne key thing to remember is the uncertainty around the estimated support for the candidates.\n\nUncertainty: 'Margin of error'\n\nWhile pollsters publish a percentage figure for each, they also report a 'margin of error' to indicate the amount that support might vary.\n\nFor example, if a poll puts Mr Trump on 46% with a three-percentage point margin of error, it means that his support among the voting public should lie between 43% and 49%. If the same poll has Ms Harris on 49%, then her support should lie between 46% and 52%.\n\nAll this tells us is that the contest is close and either candidate could be leading.\n\nSimilar caution is required when looking at trackers using polling averages.\n\nYou might think that averaging the polls would reduce uncertainty, since random errors should cancel out. But some pollsters are consistently more accurate than others, while some may be systematically wrong in one direction. Adding them all together can reinforce those biases.\n\nRead more on the election:\n\nWhat exactly happens on the night of the US election?\n\nHow does Donald Trump keep his support so strong?\n\nImage: Trump in Wisconsin at the start of the month. Pic: AP\n\nPredicting the turnout: Context matters\n\nWho votes in an election is also critical to the outcome but predicting that is a tough ask for pollsters. Roughly a third of eligible Americans do not cast a ballot in presidential elections, and it isn't all the same people each time.\n\nContext matters. It can make people more or less likely to vote. For example, potential changes to abortion laws seems to have mobilised many Democrats in the 2022 midterm elections.\n\nThe policies and performance of a candidate can also change the likelihood of more partisan voters to turnout.\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free\n\nThe Electoral College: Why state contests can be crucial\n\nThe same considerations are needed when looking at state polls and arguably they are more crucial to determining which candidate is most likely to win the election.\n\nThe outcome of a presidential race is decided state by state, by the Electoral College, and the difference between that and the national vote has been growing.\n\nRead more: What is the Electoral College?\n\nImage: Harris discusses abortion rights in Arizona in June. Pic: Reuters/Rebecca Noble\n\nIn 2000 and in 2016, the candidate with the most votes nationally lost the election because they didn't win a combination of states that delivered the highest tally in the Electoral College.\n\nThis is why battleground state polls get so much attention and they are factored into the models of statisticians trying to forecast the outcome.\n\nOf course, they have the same uncertainty and potential flaws as national polls. And the bad news is their recent performance hasn't been great.\n\nIn 2016 they suggested Ms Clinton would sweep the key states needed for a comfortable win in the Electoral College. In 2020, they fared even worse.\n\nSome states have proven particularly difficult to poll accurately. In 2016 and 2020, the biggest misses were in Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.\n\nThese, especially Pennsylvania, which of the group carries the most Electoral College votes, are all potentially decisive in 2024.\n\nFollow Sky News on WhatsApp Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky News Tap here\n\nSo, what can the polls tell us?\n\nThe answer is plenty if you are looking for a steer on how people feel about a certain candidate or policy.\n\nBut, if you're trying to work out who's ahead in the race to be president, then all you can confidently say is the contest is really close and could come down to a small number of votes in a few states.",

        "text": "Kamala Harris, Tim Walz will be featured on \"60 Minutes.\" Here's what to know for the interview.\nVoters will get the chance to hear from Vice President Kamala Harris on Monday as she presents her case for why she should be president in a \"60 Minutes\" election special.\n\nFor decades, \"60 Minutes\" has featured both Republican and Democratic nominees for presidents, but this year, former President Donald Trump backed out after previously indicating he would be on the show. Correspondent Scott Pelley, who'd been set to interview Trump, will instead travel to Arizona's Maricopa County, home to more than 60% of Arizona's voters and a critical battleground in a key swing state.\n\nOne thing is certain about the election; with the U.S. deeply involved in both the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, whoever wins on Nov. 5 will become a wartime president.\n\nWhat Harris will discuss\n\nIsrael's war started one year ago after Hamas launched a surprise terror attack and correspondent Bill Whitaker will discuss the ongoing war with Harris.\n\nHarris will also discuss the economy, immigration, her record as vice president and the differences between herself and Trump.\n\nDemocratic vice presidential candidate Gov. Tim Walz will also appear.\n\nWhitaker joined the Democratic ticket on the campaign trail this week to gain insight into their platform's priorities and values, and what the candidates believe voters should know.\n\nWhy Trump pulled out of the \"60 Minutes\" interview\n\nLeading up to the candidate hour, Trump, through campaign spokespeople, was the first candidate to accept the \"60 Minutes\" request to be interviewed for the special, according to CBS News. It had been agreed that both candidates would receive equal time during the broadcast.\n\nTrump last sat down with 60 Minutes in 2020. He walked out during the interview with Lesley Stahl. Trump referenced the incident on Tuesday night at a Milwaukee press conference when asked about his decision not to participate in the Oct. 7 \"60 Minutes\" election special.\n\n\"Well, right now, I went to - they came to me and would like me to do an interview, but first I want to get an apology, because the last time I did an interview with them, if you remember, they challenged me on the computer,\" Trump said. \"They said the 'laptop from hell' was from Russia, and I said it wasn't from Russia. It was from Hunter, and I never got an apology, so I'm sort of waiting. I'd love to do '60 Minutes.' I do everything.\"\n\nThe Republican nominee for president emphasized that he felt he was owed an apology from \"60 Minutes.\"\n\n\"Let's see if they do it. I wouldn't mind doing 60,\" Trump continued. \"I've done '60 Minutes' a lot.\"\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Trump campaign communications director Steven Cheung said that Trump's team had not agreed to an interview.\n\n\"Fake News,\" Cheung said in a post on X. \"60 Minutes begged for an interview, even after they were caught lying about Hunter Biden's laptop back in 2020. There were initial discussions, but nothing was ever scheduled or locked in. They also insisted on doing live fact checking, which is unprecedented.\"\n\nPrevious Trump, Harris appearances on 60 Minutes\n\nTrump previously sat down with \"60 Minutes'\" Mike Wallace in 1985, Pelley in 2015 and Lesley Stahl twice in 2016, first in July of that year and then again in November of 2016. He also spoke with Stahl again in 2018 and 2020.\n\nHarris previously sat down with Whitaker last year. She also was interviewed by Norah O'Donnell, \"CBS Evening News\" anchor and \"60 Minutes\" contributing correspondent, in 2020. Whitaker also interviewed Harris in 2018 when she was senator.\n\nHow to watch the \"60 Minutes\" election special",

Current SNAP eligibility requirements for students are complex and confusing, making them harder to get and complicating outreach efforts by colleges and universities and state and local governments.\n\n\n\nThe organizations noted that by streamlining SNAP requirements and making these benefits more accessible, Congress can increase the number of individuals who successfully complete a postsecondary credential, allowing them to better provide for themselves and their families while contributing to our workforce and economy.\n\n\u201cResearch consistently shows that obtaining a postsecondary credential is one of the most reliable ways to improve upward socioeconomic mobility and to increase employability in jobs providing family-sustaining wages,\u201d the letter states. \u201cBy giving individuals a stronger economic foundation, higher education in turn decreases the need for individuals to rely on SNAP or other federal benefit programs in the future.\u201d",

A study by the Cato Institute found \u201cnoncitizens did not illegally vote in detectable numbers\u201d in the 2020 election.\n\n\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a lot of it as a percentage, but there shouldn\u2019t be any of it,\u201d Ashcroft said.\n\nThe Secretary of State\u2019s Office will be watching, Ashcroft said, adding that some non-citizens have stepped forward on this matter.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been automatically registered even when they didn\u2019t want to be and I applaud those individuals for coming forward and saying, \u2018Whoa, whoa, whoa; I love America, but I want to follow the law,\u201d he said.\n\nThough the union did not respond to our report, the Missouri Democratic Party wrote FOX 2: \u201cLiUNA is the international organization of construction craft laborers, with more than 500,000 members across the country. All unions routinely send information and mail to their members on various issues, and some of those issues may not apply to them.\u201d\n\nUpdate: Although LiUNA did not respond directly to FOX 2, they released the following statement on social media Monday evening regarding this report:\n\n\u201cLiUNA is proud to represent over 500,000 workers across North America, providing vital information on a range of issues, including politics, to keep our members informed about what\u2019s happening within or concerning their union. This includes providing information to them about policies and policymakers who can impact their economic situation. LiUNA sends out information using its database, which does not indicate whether a worker is a U.S. citizen or legally working here through programs like guest worker visas. Laborers Local 110 did not send out this information.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cNeither Laborers Local 110 nor LiUNA encourages individuals to commit voting crimes. It is absurd to suggest that we advocate for non-citizens to vote. Such claims are insulting, as it is illegal for non-citizens to vote, and Missouri requires proof of identity before anyone can receive a ballot. Our priority continues to be supporting our members and their rights, their families, and their benefits.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

But it\u2019s economic woes \u2013 from inflation to housing \u2013 that could drive them to the polls. It\u2019s Isabella Morris\u2019s first presidential election, and the 21-year-old mum from Rosenberg, Texas, said she\u2019s listening closely to what both candidates have to say. Recently married with a two-year-old, Isabella works part-time to supplement her husband\u2019s full-time income. She stays at home with her child while her family rents a small one-bedroom apartment. The plan seemed solid\u2014two incomes, no mortgage, or daycare costs\u2014but it\u2019s not enough. \u201cOur debts are paid off, but we can\u2019t afford any mistakes. We have no savings, nothing. One job used to be enough to live on, even at a minimum wage. Now it feels like we\u2019re barely scraping by,\" she said.\n\nEconomic fears about her future will drive her to vote in November, but when she spoke to the BBC, she was still undecided on which candidate she would support. \u201cAs these elections draw closer, we cannot possibly fathom a candidate not addressing the economic crisis right now,\u201d she said. Isabella is one of 8 million young people who will be voting in a presidential election for the first time. Comprising about a third of the US electorate, voters under 35 are being fought over by both parties, and polls show the economy is their top priority this election season. Though reproductive rights, the war in Gaza and gun violence have dominated headlines when it comes to young voters\u2019 policy priorities, 18 to 26-year-olds rank economic growth, income inequality and poverty as the most important problems facing the country, according to a Gen Forward Survey conducted by the University of Chicago and released in September. That\u2019s in contrast to the 2020 election, when Covid-19, racism, and healthcare outranked the economy as the main issue driving young voters to the polls, according to the same survey.\n\n'The situation has degraded'\n\nIsabella\u2019s concerns reflect the broader challenges facing young voters, who are entering a world of high rents, unaffordable homes and slowing job creation - not to mention a once-in-a-generation surge in prices, according to economics TikToker Kyla Scanlon. Last month, the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates for the first time in more than four years, a decision which could lead to lower borrowing costs on mortgages, credit cards and saving rates for millions of people. But it remains to be seen whether the change in rates will change people\u2019s outlook on the economy. \"The overall situation has degraded,\" Ms Scanlon, 27, told the BBC, noting that young people today have it worse than previous generations - even millennials who entered the workforce after the 2008 financial crisis. A Gen Z-er herself, Ms Scanlon often turns to TikTok, where she has more than 180,000 followers, to educate young people about the economy.\n\nAllow TikTok content?

And their debt is rising faster than their income. \u201cThere's no beginner mode anymore - the bottom rung of the ladder just feels completely gone, I think, for most of the generation,\u201d Ms Scanlon said. And those fears of being left behind could drive voters to the ballot box, experts say. Abby Kiesa, deputy director of the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (Circle), told the BBC she expects about half of young voters to turn out in this election \u2013 a similar proportion to 2020, which had the highest turnout in decades and an 11% increase compared to the presidential election in 2016. Meanwhile, the 2018 midterms saw a record-breaking turnout among young voters, according to Circle. That\u2019s still far below the turnout of other age groups. In 2020, 69% of eligible Americans aged 35-64 voted, while 74% of voters over the age of 65 went to the polls, according to the US Census. But in an election that will be won by a razor\u2019s edge, being able to rally a significant percentage of new voters could help give a candidate the boost they need to win. Ms Kiesa said focusing on addressing economic hardship will be key if politicians hope to boost turnout among Gen Z-ers feeling disconnected from politics. \u201cFor the past three elections, turnout among young voters has been historic,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need candidates who understand, engage, and speak with them. That\u2019s what has to change.\u201d\n\nWill dollars and cents win votes?\n\nThe two presidential nominees - Trump and Harris - have both sharpened their economic message in recent weeks and stepped up efforts to appeal to young voters. Harris has expanded on the Biden administration\u2019s economic initiatives around student loan forgiveness, consumer pricing and housing affordability. She\u2019s proposed a $25,000 subsidy for first-time home buyers and a $6,000 tax credit for families with newborns. Her campaign has doubled her youth organising staff and invested heavily in digital ads. She has enjoyed endorsements from high-profile celebrities including Taylor Swift and Billie Eilish, and built momentum by embracing viral memes about the vice-president on social media. Harris has also spent the last year touring college campuses in key battleground states. Meanwhile, Trump has sought to capitalise on economic dissatisfaction among young people, attacking Harris and Biden\u2019s economic record and highlighing lower prices on goods under his administration. Both he and Harris have promised to eliminate tip taxation - a move aimed at the service industry, which employs millions of young people - and committed to ending regulatory barriers on cryptocurrency. The former president has also tried to reach younger voters through social media, podcasts, and partnerships with influencers. He\u2019s posted TikToks with influencers like Logan Paul and Adin Ross. Polls showed Trump made inroads among young voters while he was running against Biden, who is 81. When Biden was still in the race, he led Trump by only a few percentage points, and the GenForward survey showed young people thought Trump handled the economy better than the Biden administration. But momentum has shifted back to the much younger Harris. She now holds a 31-point lead over Trump among likely voters aged 18-29, according to the Harvard Institute of Politics poll released in late September.\n\n'We need representation'\n\nEconomic woes aren\u2019t just driving people to vote, they\u2019re lighting a fire in some young people to run for office themselves. Gabriel Sanchez, 27, a Democratic candidate for the Georgia state legislature, said he\u2019s running for office to try to help ease the financial strain on his generation. As a waiter at a sports bar, he said rent hikes have forced him to move repeatedly. He is concerned that essentials like stable housing are becoming a privilege for many young Americans. \u201cMost of us aren\u2019t able to own a home, afford healthcare or buy the basic things we need,\u201d Sanchez said in a TikTok posted on his campaign account. In May, Sanchez and three other young candidates cruised to victory in Georgia\u2019s Democratic primary election, an outcome dubbed as Gen Z\u2019s night in Atlanta.\n\nAllow TikTok content?

This economy isn\u2019t working for us,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cWe need representation - candidates who understand what young people are going through.\u201d But it\u2019s not only Democrats that are luring young candidates. Wyatt Gable, a 21-year-old in his last year at East Carolina University, won the Republican primary for North Carolina\u2019s House of Representatives. He defeated George Cleveland, a 10-term, 85-year-old, incumbent. If elected in November, Gable will become the youngest person ever to hold a seat in the state legislature. As he prepares for the November vote, he said he expects the economy to be top of mind for young people at the polls this year. \u201cMy generation feels it. Seeing how bad inflation is, and with interest rates skyrocketing, that's going to be the biggest thing on young people's minds when they go to the ballot box,\u201d he said.",

        "text": "\u2018Voter suppression has a long and troubling history in the US,\u2019 expert says\nEVANSTON, Ill. --- With the U.S. Presidential election just weeks away, efforts to purge voter rolls in key battleground states have prompted concern from the Department of Justice regarding possible violations of federal rules governing registered voter lists.\n\nWith the DOJ seeking to root out the ruler-breakers, voters are also absorbing details from the recent unsealing of the indictment against former President Donald Trump by U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan. The 165-page filing documents multiple incidents in which Trump continued to promote false claims that voter fraud caused him to lose the election, despite ample evidence to the contrary.\n\nProfessors of law and political science at Northwestern University are available to comment on voter suppression as a strategy to disenfranchise voters and influence election outcomes.\n\nTabitha Bonilla is an associate professor of political science, human development and social policy at Northwestern. Her research focuses on voting behavior, political messaging and political representation. She can be reached by contacting Stephanie Kulke at stephanie.kulke@northwestern.edu.\n\nQuote from Professor Bonilla\n\n\u201cRemoving voters from voter rolls is concerning when it disproportionately targets certain types of voters. Voters of color and older voters tend to be more likely to be removed from voter rolls than other types of voters, making it more difficult for their voices to be heard. Voter fraud is incredibly uncommon, and it\u2019s less clear to me that these moves are actually preserving the integrity of the ballot box more so than they are working to make it harder for certain people to vote.\u201d\n\nAlvin B. Tillery Jr. is a professor of political science and Black studies and the director of the Center for the Study of Diversity and Democracy at Northwestern. His research focuses on American politics, race relations and affirmative action and diversity policies. He can be reached at alvin.tillery@northwestern.edu or by contacting Stephanie Kulke at stephanie.kulke@northwestern.edu.\n\nQuote from Professor Tillery\n\n\u201cVoter suppression against Black voters has a long and troubling history in the United States. What we must understand is that gaining access to the franchise rights promised to Black Americans in the 15th Amendment was one of the primary forces that gave rise to the long civil rights movement. Between the passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965 and the SCOTUS decision that gutted it in 2013, there was a broad cultural consensus that the federal government should protect minority voters from voter suppression and that governments on all levels should be making it easier to vote. Unfortunately, as our population began to diversify and embrace more progressive stances on cultural issues, many in the Republican Party rightly began to realize that giving minority populations easy access to the ballot would make it harder for them to win elections.\n\n\u201cWe now stand at a point in history where the Republican Party as an entity has been given the greenlight by a Supreme Court packed with radical rightwing judges to suppress the voting rights of Black Americans, Latinos, college students and anyone else that they deem a threat to their electoral interests. We should see the Republican Party\u2019s voter suppression movement as just a larger piece of the puzzle that indicates their full embrace of an authoritarian turn.\u201d\n\nMichael Kang is a nationally recognized expert on election law. As the Class of 1940 Professor of Law at Northwestern Pritzker School of Law, his expertise includes campaign finance, voting rights, redistricting, judicial elections and corporate governance.

        "text": "Kamala Harris makes the case in 60 Minutes interview for why she should be president\nKamala Harris has been a candidate for president for just two-and-a-half months and the post convention \"honeymoon\" is over. With the election just 29 days away, Harris and her running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz face unrelenting attacks from Donald Trump, and the race remains extremely close.\n\nWe met the 59-year-old vice president this past week on the campaign trail and later at the vice president's residence in Washington, DC. We spoke about the economy and immigration, Ukraine, and China, but we began with the escalating war in the Middle East, one year after the Hamas terror attack on Israel.\n\nBill Whitaker: The events of the past few weeks have pushed us to the brink, if\u2014if not into an all-out regional war in the Middle East. What can the U.S. do at this point to stop this from spinning out of control?\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: Well, let's start with October 7. 1,200 people were massacred, 250 hostages were taken, including Americans, women were brutally raped, and as I said then, I maintain Israel has a right to defend itself. We would. And how it does so matters. Far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed. This war has to end.\n\nBill Whitaker: We supply Israel with billions of dollars in military aid, and yet Prime Minister Netanyahu seems to be charting his own course. The Biden-Harris administration has pressed him to agree to a ceasefire. He's resisted. You urged him not to go into Lebanon. He went in anyway. Does the U.S. have no sway over Prime Minister Netanyahu?\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: The work that we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit around making clear our principles.\n\nBill Whitaker: But it seems that Prime Minister Netanyahu is not listening.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: We are not gonna stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end.\n\nBill Whitaker: Do we have a--a real close ally in Prime Minister Netanyahu?\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: I think, with all due respect, the better question is do we have an important alliance between the American people and the Israeli people. And the answer to that question is yes.\n\nWhile the war in the Middle East has dominated recent headlines, it's the economy that most concerns American voters this election year, as always.\n\nBill Whitaker: There are lots of signs that the American economy is doing very well, better than most countries, I think. But the American people don't seem to be feeling it. Groceries are 25% higher and people are blaming you and Joe Biden for that. Are they wrong?\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: We now have historic low unemployment in America among all groups of people. We now have an economy that is thriving by all macroeconomic measures. And, to your point, prices are still too high. And I know that, and we need to deal with it, which is why part of my plan\u2014you mentioned groceries. Part of my plan is what we must do to bring down the price of groceries.\n\nBill Whitaker and Vice President Kamala Harris 60 Minutes\n\nHarris says she'll press Congress to pass a federal ban on price gouging for food and groceries, but details are yet to be defined.\n\nBill Whitaker: You want to expand\u2013 the child tax credit.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: Yes, I do.\n\nBill Whitaker: You want to give tax breaks to first-time home buyers.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: Yes.\n\nBill Whitaker: And people starting small businesses.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: Correct.\n\nBill Whitaker: But it is estimated by the Nonpartisan Committee for Responsible Federal Budget that your economic plan would add $3 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade. How are you gonna pay for that?\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: OK, so the other econ- economists that have reviewed my plan versus my opponent and determined that my economic plan would strengthen America's economy. His would weaken it.\n\nBill Whitaker: But--\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: My plan, Bill, if you don't mind, my plan is about saying that when you invest in small businesses, you invest in the middle class, and you strengthen America's economy. Small businesses are part of the backbone of America's economy.\n\nBill Whitaker: But\u2014but pardon me, Madame Vice President, I-- the-- the question was, how are you going to pay for it?\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: Well, one of the things is I'm gonna make sure that the richest among us, who can afford it, pay their fair share in taxes. It is not right that teachers and nurses and firefighters are paying a har-- a higher tax rate than billionaires and the biggest corporations.\n\nBill Whitaker: But\u2014but\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: And I plan on making that fair.\n\nBill Whitaker: But we're dealing with the real world here.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: But the real world includes\u2014\n\nBill Whitaker: How are you gonna get this through Congress?\n\nVice President Kamala Harris 60 Minutes\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: You know, when you talk quietly with a lot of folks in Congress, they know exactly what I'm talking about, 'cause their constituents know exactly what I'm talking about. Their constituents are those firefighters and teachers and nurses. Their constituents are middle-class, hard-working folk.\n\nBill Whitaker: And Congress has shown no inclination to move in your direction.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: I-- I disagree with you. There are plenty of leaders in Congress who understand and know that the Trump tax cuts blew up our federal deficit. None of us, and certainly I cannot afford to be myopic in terms of how I think about strengthening America's economy. Lemme tell you something. I am a devout public servant. You know that. I am also a capitalist. And I know the limitations of government.\n\nKamala Harris has been in government for decades; she was first elected San Francisco district attorney in 2003, then California attorney general, she went on to the U.S. Senate, and now vice president.\n\nBill Whitaker: A quarter of registered voters still say they don't know you. They don't know what makes you tick. And-- and why do you think that is? What\u2013what's the disconnect?\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: It's an election, Bill. And I take-- it seriously that I have to earn everyone's vote. This is an election for president of the United States. No one should be able to take for granted that they can just declare themselves a candidate and automatically receive support. You have to earn it. And that's what I intend to do.\n\nBill Whitaker: Lemme tell you what your critics and the columnists say.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: OK.\n\nBill Whitaker: They say that the reason so many voters don't know you is that you have changed your position on so many things. You were against fracking, now you're for it. You supported looser immigration policies, now you're tightening them up. You were for Medicare for all, now you're not. So many that people don't truly know what you believe or what you stand for. And I know you've heard that.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: In the last four years I have been vice president of the United States. And I have been traveling our country. And I have been listening to folks and seeking what is possible in terms of common ground. I believe in building consensus. We are a diverse people. Geographically, regionally, in terms of where we are in our backgrounds. And what the American people do want is that we have leaders who can build consensus. Where we can figure out compromise and understand it's not a bad thing, as long as you don't compromise your values, to find common-sense solutions. And that has been my approach.\n\nBut one issue that has proven impervious to compromise is immigration. Over the past four years, the Biden/Harris approach has been inconsistent, and Republicans are convinced immigration is the vice president's achilles heel.\n\nBill Whitaker: You recently visited the southern border and-- embraced President Biden's recent crackdown on asylum seekers. And that crackdown produced an almost immediate and dramatic decrease in the number of border crossings. If that's the right answer now, why didn't your administration take those steps in 2021?\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: The first bill we proposed to Congress was to fix our broken immigration system, knowing that if you want to actually fix it, we need Congress to act. It was not taken up. Fast forward to a moment when a bipartisan group of members of the United States Senate, including one of the most conservative members of the United States Senate, got together, came up with the border security bill. Well, guess what happened? Donald Trump got word that this bill was afoot and could be passed and he wants to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem, so he told his buddies in Congress, \"Kill the bill. Don't let it move forward.\"\n\nBill Whitaker: But I've been covering the border for-- for years. And so I know this is not a problem that started with your administration.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: Correct. Correct.\n\nBill Whitaker: But there was an historic flood of undocumented immigrants coming across the border the first three years of your administration. As a matter of fact, arrivals quadrupled from the last year of President Trump. Was it a mistake to loosen the immigration policies as much as you did?\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: It's a longstanding problem. And solutions are at hand. And from day one, literally, we have been offering solutions.\n\nBill Whitaker and Vice President Kamala Harris 60 Minutes\n\nBill Whitaker: What I was asking was, was it a mistake to kind of allow that flood to happen in the first place?\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: I think-- the policies that we have been proposing are about fixing a problem, not promoting a problem, okay? But the--\n\nBill Whitaker: But the numbers did quadruple under your--\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: And the numbers today--\n\nBill Whitaker: --under your watch--\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: --because of what we have done-- we have cut the flow of illegal immigration by half. We have cut the--\n\nBill Whitaker: But should you have done that--\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: --flow of fentanyl--\n\nBill Whitaker: --should you have done that--\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: --by half. But we need Congress to be able to act to actually fix the problem.\n\nBill Whitaker: You have accused Donald Trump of using racist tropes when it comes to Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, when it comes to birtherism, when it comes to Charlottesville. In fact, you have called him a racist and divisive. Yet Donald Trump has the support of millions and millions of Americans. How do you explain that?\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: I am glad you're pointing these comments out that he has made, that have resulted in a response by most reasonable people to say, \"It's just wrong. It's just wrong.\"\n\nBill Whitaker: With so many people supporting Donald Trump, a man you have called a racist. How do you bridge that seemingly unbridgeable gap?\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: I believe that the people of America want a leader who's not tryin' to divide us and demean. I believe that the American people recognize that the true measure of the strength of a leader is not based on who you beat down, it's based on who you lift up.\n\nThe Harris campaign has been hopscotching the country and with less than a month to go, the pace is picking up. The vice president told us, she's lost track of how many states she's visited.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: How are you doing?\n\nBill Whitaker: I'm doing well.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: You well?\n\nWe joined her on the trail late last week, in the crucial swing state of Wisconsin, in the town of Ripon, the birthplace in 1854 of the Republican Party.\n\nAnd at a rally plastered with \"country over party\" banners, Harris appeared with staunch conservative Liz Cheney. As vice chair of the House January 6th Committee, Cheney became one of Donald Trump's fiercest critics.\n\nLiz Cheney: I have never voted for a Democrat, but this year, I am proudly casting my vote for Vice President Kamala Harris (applause)\n\nThat proclamation spurred a chant of approval from the crowd\u2026\n\nBill Whitaker: Four years ago if someone had told you that you would be campaigning with Liz Cheney, what would you have said to them?\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: That'd be great. (laughter)\n\nLiz Cheney: She's really diplomatic. (laughter)\n\nBill Whitaker: Would you ever have thought that you'd be campaigning with Kamala Harris?\n\nLiz Cheney: I hope that if you had said to me four years ago, \"Our constitution is going to be under threat and it's gonna be crucial for the parties to come together-- and to support Vice President Harris because she'll defend the rule of law\"-- I know I would've said, \"That's exactly what I'll do.\"\n\nWhoever wins the presidency will take on a host of daunting challenges, especially beyond our borders. Back in Washington, Vice President Harris told us she's determined the U.S must win the economic competition with China for the 21st century. And as for the war between Russia and Ukraine?\n\nBill Whitaker: What does success look like in ending the war in Ukraine?\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: There will be no success in ending that war without Ukraine and the UN charter participating in what that success looks like.\n\nBill Whitaker: Would you meet with President Vladimir Putin to negotiate a solution to the war in Ukraine?\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: Not bilaterally without Ukraine, no. Ukraine must have a say in the future of Ukraine.\n\nBill Whitaker: As president, would you support the effort to expand NATO to include Ukraine?\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: Those are all issues that we will deal with if and when it arrives at that point. Right now, we are supporting Ukraine's ability to defend itself against Russia's unprovoked aggression. Donald Trump, if he were president, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now. He talks about, \"Oh, he can end it on day one.\" You know what that is? It's about surrender.\n\nBill Whitaker: A hard left turn here. But-- you recently surprised people when you said that you are a gun owner and that if someone came into your house--\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: That was not the first time I've-- I've--\n\nBill Whitaker: --they would get shot.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: --talked about it. That's not the first time I've talked about it.\n\nBill Whitaker: So what kind of gun do you own, and when and why did you get it?\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: I have a Glock, and-- I've had it for quite some time. And-- I mean, look, Bill, my background is in law enforcement. And-- so there you go.\n\nBill Whitaker: Have you-- ever fired it?\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: Yes. (laugh) Of course I have. At a shooting range. Yes, of course I have.\n\nDemocratic vice-presidential candidate Tim Walz was little-known outside Minnesota just two months ago. He didn't exactly come from nowhere. He was a six-term congressman and now is governor of Minnesota, where he has championed abortion rights, gun control, and other progressive ideas. But it was calling former President Trump and Sen. JD Vance \"weird\" that may have landed him on the ticket.\n\n60 Minutes\n\nBill Whitaker: Two months ago, you and Kamala Harris barely knew each other. Now, you're running together, vying for the top offices in the land. It's not possible that you agree on everything.\n\nGov. Tim Walz: Yeah.\n\nBill Whitaker: What have been some disagreements you've had since you became a team?\n\nGov. Tim Walz: Well\u2014I\u2014she'd probably disagreed with\u2014she said, \"Tim, you know, you need to be a little more careful on how you say (laugh) things,\" whatever it might be.\n\nWhatever it might be, Walz has been criticized for embellishing or telling outright falsehoods about his military record, and about his travels to Asia in the 1980s.\n\nBill Whitaker: In your debate with JD Vance, you said, \"I'm a knucklehead (laugh) at times.\" And I think you were referring to the time that you said that you were in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square unrest when you were not.\n\nGov. Tim Walz: Yeah.\n\nBill Whitaker: Is that kind of misrepresentation, isn't that more than just being a knucklehead?\n\nGov. Tim Walz: I think folks know who I am. And I think they know the difference between someone expressing emotion, telling a story, getting a date wrong by--you--rather than a pathological liar like Donald Trump.\n\nBill Whitaker: But I think it comes down to the question of whether\u2014whether you can be trusted to tell the truth.\n\nGov. Tim Walz: Yeah. Well-- I can-- I think I can. I will own up to being a knucklehead at times, but the folks closest to me know that I keep my word.\n\nWalz proudly touts his record as governor of Minnesota, but it also has opened him up to criticism from his Republican opponents.\n\nBill Whitaker: Former President Trump says that you and your administration here in Minnesota has been dangerously liberal. Radical left, he calls it. So, what do you say to that criticism, that rather than leading the way, you and Minnesota are actually out of step with the rest of the country?\n\nGov. Tim Walz: President Trump may be referring to that \u2013 that our children get breakfast and lunch in school so that they can learn. He may be talkin' about we have a paid family medical leave policy that was promoted by the business community. Donald Trump spends his time tearing down states rather than lifting up the things we do, the best of it. Donald Trump's critiques of that, not only are they wrong, but I'm waiting for, \"What\u2014what is his solution? Here in Minnesota, we're so optimistic, we walk on water half the year (laugh).\n\nIt was that kind of humor and candor that helped land Tim Walz the job as Kamala Harris's running mate.\n\nBill Whitaker: Before you joined the\u2013 ticket, you called Republicans \"weird.\" And that's sort of become a rallying cry for Democrats. Why do you think that label stuck?\n\nGov. Tim Walz: I was really talking about the behaviors. Being obsessed with people's personal lives in their bedrooms and their reproductive rights, making up stories about legal \u2013folks legally here eating cats and dogs, they're dehumanizing. They go beyond weird because I said this: it becomes almost dangerous. Let's debate policy in a real way and let's try and find an objective truth again.\n\nKamala Harris and Tim Walz are in a full sprint to November 5th, hoping their arguments will give them a chance to cross the line ahead of Donald Trump and JD Vance.\n\nBill Whitaker: You are sitting here with us. The Trump campaign canceled an interview that they had agreed to, to participate in this broadcast. What do you make of that?\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: If he is not gonna give your viewers the ability to have a meaningful, thoughtful conversation, question and answer with you, then watch his rallies. You're gonna hear conversations that are about himself and all of his personal grievances. And what you will not hear is anything about you, the listener. You will not hear about how he is gonna try to bring the country together, find common ground. And, Bill, that is why I believe in my soul and heart, the American people are ready to turn the page.\n\nProduced by Marc Lieberman and Rome Hartman.

        "text": "The Crypto Election: Crypto, Disinformation, and Presidential Politics\nCryptocurrency has become a central issue in the 2024 US election, intersecting with campaign finance, election integrity, and security.\n\nFormer President Trump openly supports crypto, having spoken at key Bitcoin conferences and even launching his own crypto project. Vice President Kamala Harris, seemingly more reticent, called for the US to maintain its dominance in blockchain technology in a recent speech on the economy. Both candidates, and the PACs that support them, are accepting some form of cryptocurrency. This development presents new opportunities for political engagement\u2014but also introduces challenges related to regulation and security.\n\nElection interference and disinformation risks\n\nWhile candidates in the US are developing policy positions and talking points for how they might support or regulate digital assets, threat actors like Russia are\u2014in part\u2014using cryptocurrencies to send funds in support of election interference and disinformation campaigns.\n\nAccording to TRM\u2019s Global Head of Policy, Ari Redbord, \u201cAll six high profile election interference cases since 2016 have involved the use of cryptocurrencies. This underscores a move by illicit actors\u2014particularly those with connections to Russia, who are looking to new technology\u2014to raise and move funds.\u201d\n\nThe six cases Redbord alludes to involve a diverse lineup of illicit actors, including Russian news outlets, paramilitary groups, hackers, and Russian intelligence services. \u201cRussia has fostered an illicit finance ecosystem of darknet markets, non-compliant crypto businesses, ransomware, and paramilitary groups,\u201d Redbord explained. \u201cAll these pieces of Russia\u2019s money laundering puzzle play a role in interference and disinformation.\u201d\n\nRussian-fueled disinformation and election interference campaigns have become part of the last two election cycles. The US Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) and the Department of Justice have targeted individuals and entities associated with Russian election interference and disinformation.\n\nMajor election interference cases all involve cryptocurrencies\n\nCryptocurrencies have long played a role in Russian election interference and disinformation. According to TRM\u2019s Redbord, these were the six most high-profile cases involving the use of cryptocurrencies since 2016:\n\nRussian Internet Research Agency (IRA) \u2013 2016 US.Election\n\nProject Lakhta \u2013 2018 US Midterm Elections\n\nSouthFront \u2013 Disinformation Campaign (2021)\n\nTask Force Rusich \u2013 Russia-Ukraine Conflict (2022)\n\nDoppelganger Campaign \u2013 2024 US Election\n\nRT (Russia Today) and RaHDit \u2013 Global Disinformation Networks (2024)\n\nDisinformation campaigns funded via cryptocurrency typically involve a network of facilitators\u2014including exchanges, domain registrars, hosting providers, payment processors, digital marketing agencies, deepfake producers, social media amplifiers, and \"articles for hire\" services.\n\n{{fyicard-thecryptoelection-1}}\n\nIn its March 2024 release announcing sanctions, Treasury wrote, \u201cThe Russian government employs an array of tools, including malign influence campaigns and illicit cyber activities, to undermine the interests of the United States and its allies and partners.\u201d Treasury continued, \u201cRussia routinely uses its intelligence services, proxies, and influence tools in these efforts. Russia\u2019s influence actors have increasingly adapted their methods to hide their involvement by developing a vast ecosystem of Russian proxy websites, personas, and organizations which give the false appearance of being independent news sources.\u201d\n\nRussia\u2019s deepfake playbook\n\nIn September 2024, OFAC sanctioned key figures from RT, Russia's state-funded news media outlet, for using a variety of methods\u2014including AI-generated deepfakes and disinformation\u2014to influence American audiences. These actors covertly recruited US influencers, using front companies to mask their ties to the Russian government and sow distrust in US election processes.\n\nThe Kremlin's malign influence operations are wide-reaching, employing covert cyber activities and proxy websites to spread disinformation. A key player in this effort was Doppelg\u00e4nger, a Russian-linked influence operation that used deepfake content to push disinformation. Doppelg\u00e4nger, identified in 2022, operated through a network of websites and fake personas designed to look like independent news sources, deceiving audiences into believing they were consuming legitimate media.\n\nThe OFAC designations also targeted executives at RT, including Editor-in-Chief Margarita Simonyan, who oversaw operations aimed at disguising Russia\u2019s involvement in the disinformation campaigns. Simonyan and other executives implemented a large-scale influence operation on US social media to further Moscow's agenda. Additionally, the pro-Kremlin hacktivist group RaHDit, led by Aleksey Garashchenko, played a critical role in using cyber tools to enhance Russia\u2019s ability to conduct these influence operations.\n\nAnother central entity in this effort was ANO Dialog, a Russian nonprofit organization linked to the Doppelg\u00e4nger network. ANO Dialog used AI technology and deepfakes to create fake posts on popular social media platforms, targeting US election-related discussions. The organization\u2019s Director General, Vladimir Tabak, coordinated with Russian government officials to amplify disinformation through fake news sites like \"Reliable Recent News\" (RRN) and \u201cWar on Fakes.\u201d This included the use of deepfake content designed to manipulate public perception and spread false narratives about the US election process.\n\nRussian interference in the 2016 US election\n\nOne of the most well-known cases linking cryptocurrency to election interference involved Russia\u2019s Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), which played a central role in spear-phishing attacks, spreading disinformation, and hacking during the 2016 US elections. The GRU used bitcoin to fund its operations, purchasing servers, domains, and other tools necessary for these activities.\n\nAccording to the indictment, the GRU bitcoin mining operation funded the purchase of servers and domains used in the GRU\u2019s spear phishing campaigns. Under the persona \"Guccifer 2.0,\" the GRU claimed responsibility for hacking the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and leaking documents to the media, WikiLeaks, and other outlets. The GRU also purchased bitcoin through the P2P platform LocalBitcoins, which it used to purchase a VPN to log into the @Guccifer_2 Twitter account. The remaining funds from the same Bitcoin address were then used to lease a Malaysian server that hosted the dcleaks.com website. In March 2018, the US The Department of the Treasury sanctioned Russian cyber actors for interference with the 2016 US elections and malicious cyber attacks.\n\nTRM\u2019s graph visualizer showing the payment for leasing the Malaysian server used to host the dcleaks.com website\n\nHow disinformation campaigns use cryptocurrencies\n\nIn March 2024, OFAC sanctioned two individuals and two entities for services they provided to the Russian government in connection with a disinformation campaign, including attempting to impersonate legitimate media outlets.\n\nSpecifically, OFAC designated Russian national Ilya Andreevich Gambashidze for his role in foreign malign influence campaigns that were conducted at the direction of the Kremlin. Treasury asserted that Gambashidze and his company, the Social Design Agency (SDA), along with Nikolai Aleksandrovich Tupikin, the CEO and current owner of Russia-based Company Group Structura LLC (Structura), were involved in implementing a campaign that impersonated news websites in Europe. Treasury also called out Gambashidze and Tupikin\u2019s roles in creating fake videos and social media accounts in order to spread pro-Russian messaging. The campaign, which was reportedly conducted in October 2022, involved over 60 websites impersonating legitimate media.\n\nIn its sanctions designation, OFAC included a number of cryptocurrency addresses belonging to Gambashidze, including two TRON (TRX) addresses: TMGLqRQ4twjW8wJhVH1mQR7nUThpGHUsN3 and TEFph7dZoUN5233cGEzF6XFwRpjPF8fQDS.\n\nTRM\u2019s graph visualizer showing the movement of funds in and out of an address (TMGLq) associated with Gambashidze\n\nThe first address (TMGLq) was active between April 2022 and March 2024. The vast majority of the funds received by the address came from the sanctioned Russian exchange Garantex.\n\nTRM traced several payments through the cross-chain swap service, including one made to a Bitcoin wallet that paid a US-based payment processor\u2014a potential method of paying for internet infrastructure.\n\nThe TMGLqaddress converts USDT into BTC via a cross-chain swap service\n\nThe second address (TEFph) was only active between February and March 2024. It appears the vast majority of funds were sent from a hot wallet likely associated with an exchange that has also made significant transfers to other Russian cryptocurrency traders, exchanges, and services.\n\nPayments to and from the second (TEFph)address associated with Gambashidze\n\nCurrent state: Regulatory frameworks for crypto donations\n\nCrypto, however, is not only used to fund election interference. It is also used, in part, to fund campaigns.\n\nThe Federal Election Commission (FEC) first allowed political campaigns to accept cryptocurrency donations in 2014, classifying them as \"in-kind contributions.\" Candidates like Senator Rand Paul in 2016 and Andrew Yang in 2020 were early adopters, accepting bitcoin and converting it into US dollars. Fast forward to 2024: Today, both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are embracing cryptocurrency donations, utilizing third-party processors to ensure compliance with FEC regulations.\n\nState regulations vary widely. Currently, 14 states permit cryptocurrency donations for state campaigns. Tennessee has statutory laws permitting these contributions, while Colorado has updated its regulations to accommodate them. However, states like California have banned crypto donations, citing transparency concerns. In contrast, Ohio has gone a step further by setting up its own Bitcoin payment system to facilitate tax payments. Despite these advances, 34 states and the District of Columbia have neither enacted nor considered legislation on crypto donations, creating a vast gray area.\n\nTransparency and anonymity: A double-edged sword\n\nCryptocurrency's pseudonymous nature presents challenges for transparency in campaign finance. A notable example occurred during the 2022 midterm elections, when FTX made significant donations to both Republican and Democratic campaigns. While these donations were legal and reported, the rapid bankruptcy of FTX later revealed the opaque nature of funding sources. Concerns arose about whether the origins of these funds could be fully verified, particularly when some assets were held in offshore entities.\n\nFurther concerns include the potential use of cryptocurrencies to conceal the identities of donors. While Super PACs (political action committees) are required to disclose their donors to the FEC, donors can maintain anonymity by funneling money through other organizations, such as nonprofits (e.g. 501(c)(4) organizations), which are not required to disclose their donors. This practice is sometimes referred to as \"dark money\" because it allows donors to remain hidden from the public.\n\nSince blockchain transactions can be made without revealing personal information, crypto donations can skirt traditional transparency requirements in campaign finance. This has led to fears that foreign entities could exploit these characteristics to influence election outcomes covertly. While those accepting cryptocurrency may use blockchain intelligence or employ \u201cknow your customer\u201d (KYC) protocols, without compliance controls in place, donors can potentially send funds anonymously.\n\nThe future of cryptocurrency use in political campaigns\n\nAccording to an August 2024 report by consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, the crypto industry accounts for almost half the money contributed by corporations to PACs so far in 2024. According to the report, crypto companies have supplied 48% of the USD 248 million of corporate money donated to influence federal elections this cycle. Fairshake, the crypto industry's dominant political action committee, says it has raised USD 169 million. Public Citizen goes with a larger figure (USD 202 million) based on Federal Election Commission data\u2014but that includes a double-counting of cryptocurrency-based contributions from individual donors, according to the OpenSecrets research group. This is a significant increase from the USD 15 million donated in 2020.\n\nThis level of involvement underscores the crypto community's efforts to shape policy by supporting pro-crypto candidates and opposing regulatory crackdowns. The surge in crypto donations reflects the growing influence of digital assets on the political landscape\u2014and the desire among industry participants to protect their interests in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment.\n\nCryptocurrencies offer both opportunities and risks in the context of elections. They provide new avenues for political engagement and fundraising\u2014but also pose challenges related to transparency, security, and potential misuse in election interference.\n\nThe involvement of high-profile candidates like Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, along with record-breaking crypto donations in the 2024 election cycle, reflects the growing mainstream acceptance of digital assets. As the election season unfolds, it will serve as a critical test of how regulators, law enforcement, and the crypto community can navigate this complex landscape to safeguard the democratic process.",

        "text": "Trump\u2019s plan would add $4 trillion more to U.S. debt compared to Harris\u2019, analysis says\nWith less than a month left until Election Day, both the Harris and Trump campaigns have presented their economic visions to the American people \u2014 including proposed tax cuts, border security spending, and affordable housing policies. But it\u2019s still unclear how much these plans will cost, and how they will be paid for.\n\nA new report from the nonpartisan nonprofit Committee for Responsible Federal Budget finds that both former President Donald Trump and Vice President Harris will deepen the national debt to pay for their initiatives. Trump\u2019s estimated economic plan would sink the nation $7.5 trillion further into to debt over the next decade, while Harris\u2019 estimated proposals would cost the government half that \u2014 around $3.5 trillion.\n\n\u201cWhoever wins the 2024 presidential election will face an unprecedented fiscal situation upon taking office,\u201d according to the Committee for Responsible Federal Budget\u2019s report. \u201cBoth the Republican and Democratic candidates for President have put forward campaign plans that would, at best, maintain the status quo and, at worst, add tremendously to our debt and deficits.\u201d\n\nThe report said their estimates come with \u201ca high degree of uncertainty\u201d because of lack of specifics from both campaigns; the estimates for Harris\u2019 plans range from adding $0 to $8.1 trillion to the debt, while the forecasts for Trump range from $1.5 trillion to $15.2 trillion.\n\nThe committee warned of \u201can eventual fiscal crisis\u201d if politicians don\u2019t address the national debt more forcefully. The nonprofit also provided an overview of the candidates\u2018 competing economic visions \u2014 pulled from campaign websites, emails, speeches, social media posts and discussions with campaign staff.\n\nExtending Trump\u2019s Tax Code\n\nBoth Harris and Trump plan to extend portions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) \u2014 a law passed in 2017 that made major changes to the tax code. The law is set to expire in 2025.\n\nExtending the TCJA is the most expensive portion of both campaigns\u2019 economic plans, totaling $3 trillion for Harris and $5.4 trillion for Trump, according to the report.\n\nThe difference between the two costs comes from Harris\u2019 promise that \u201cno one earning less than $400,000 a year will pay more in taxes,\u201d meaning Americans earning less than that will continue to benefit from the TCJA tax cuts while those making more than that will not.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has promised to \u201cmake the Trump tax cuts permanent\u201d for all those who benefited from the law initially. Notably, Trump has promised to end the $10,000 cap on deductions for state and local taxes, known as SALT, which has become a contentious political issue.\n\nTaxes on tips, overtime and Social Security\n\nBoth the Harris and Trump campaigns have promised to eliminate taxes on tips \u2014 despite the shaking heads of economists.\n\nTrump proposed the policy first after a visit to Las Vegas. But the Harris campaign told NPR their plan is distinct as their policy would have caps on salary, meant to prevent high-earners from marking all their salary as tipped wages and taking \u201cadvantage of the policy.\u201d The Harris campaign said it also plans to increase the minimum wage in tandem with not taxing tips.\n\nThe Committee for Responsible Federal Budget estimated Harris\u2019 no-tax-on tips policy would cost $200 billion over 10 years, while Trump\u2019s would cost $300 billion.\n\nThe former president has also proposed a blanket tax exemption for overtime pay. The committee listed this as the second-most expensive portion of his economic vision, costing the U.S. government some $2 trillion over 10 years in lost taxes.\n\nTrump\u2019s call for an end to taxes on Social Security benefits is the third-most costly part of his plan. Between 50% to 85% of Social Security benefits are taxed, the committee said. Cutting those funds would increase the deficit by $1.3 trillion, it found.\n\nHarris has no plans to cut taxes on overtime pay or on Social Security benefits, according to the report.",
