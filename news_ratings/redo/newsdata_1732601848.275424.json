        "text": "American Adults Express Increasing Anxiousness in Annual Poll; Stress and Sleep are Key Factors Imp\nWashington, D.C. \u2014 The 2024 results of the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s annual mental health poll show that U.S. adults are feeling increasingly anxious. In 2024, 43% of adults say they feel more anxious than they did the previous year, up from 37% in 2023 and 32% in 2022. Adults are particularly anxious about current events (70%) \u2014 especially the economy (77%), the 2024 U.S. election (73%), and gun violence (69%).\n\nWhen asked about a list of lifestyle factors potentially impacting mental health, adults most commonly say stress (53%) and sleep (40%) have the biggest impact on their mental health. Younger adults (18-34 years old) are more likely than older adults (50+) to say social connection has the biggest impact on their mental health. Despite the increasing anxiety, most adults have not sought professional mental health support. In 2024, just one in four (24%) adults say they talked with a mental health care professional in the past year. Notably, younger adults (18-34) are more than twice as likely as older adults (50+) to have done so.\n\n\u201cLiving in a world of constant news of global and local turmoil, some anxiety is natural and expected,\u201d said APA President Petros Levounis, M.D., M.A. \u201cBut what stands out here is that Americans are reporting more anxious feelings than in past years. This increase may be due to the unprecedented exposure that we have to everything that happens in the world around us, or to an increased awareness and reporting of anxiety. Either way, if people have these feelings, they are not alone, and they can seek help from us.\u201d\n\nAmong adults who have used mental health care this year, more than half prefer to meet with a mental health professional in person (55%) rather than via telehealth; 30% prefer telehealth; and 15% have no preference. Also among adults who have used mental healthcare this year, more than half (59%) are worried about losing access to mental healthcare, and 39% of insured adults are worried about losing their health insurance, as a result of the election this year.\n\nAmericans perceive broad impacts of untreated mental illness: 83% of adults say it negatively impacts families and 65% say it negatively impacts the U.S. economy. Also, 71% of adults feel that children and teens have more mental health problems than they did 10 years ago. That said, more than half of adults (55%) think there is less mental health stigma than 10 years ago.\n\n\u201cOver the past ten years, we\u2019ve grown more comfortable talking about mental health, and that\u2019s absolutely key to helping us through the current crisis,\u201d said APA CEO and Medical Director Saul Levin, M.D., M.P.A. \u201cThe continued work of APA is to ensure that people can access care when they need it, especially in areas that need it badly, like child and adolescent psychiatry.\u201d\n\nOther issues people said they were anxious about include:\n\nKeeping themselves or their families safe, 68%.\n\nKeeping their identity safe, 63%.\n\nTheir health, 63%.\n\nPaying bills or expenses, 63%.\n\nThe opioid epidemic, 50%.\n\nThe impact of emerging technology on day-to-day life, 46%.\n\nIn addition, 57% of adults are concerned about climate change.\n\nThis annual poll was conducted April 9 to 11, 2024, among a sample of more than 2,200 adults. This annual survey is complemented by APA\u2019s Healthy Minds Monthly series, conducted by Morning Consult on behalf of APA. See past Healthy Minds Monthly polls. For a copy of the results, contact us at [email protected].\n\nAmerican Psychiatric Association\n\nThe American Psychiatric Association, founded in 1844, is the oldest medical association in the country. The APA is also the largest psychiatric association in the world with more than 38,900 physician members specializing in the diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and research of mental illnesses. APA\u2019s vision is to ensure access to quality psychiatric diagnosis and treatment. For more information, please visit www.psychiatry.org.",

        "text": "FAU/Mainstreet Poll Finds Intriguing 2024 Presidential Race Dynamics\nFAU/Mainstreet Poll Finds Intriguing 2024 Presidential Race Dynamics\n\nAmerican voters share their views on the 2024 presidential race\n\nAs the 2024 presidential race heats up, a survey conducted by FAU Political Communication and Public Opinion Research Lab (PolCom Lab) and Mainstreet Research offers a glimpse into the shifting tides of American politics.\n\nGender, Age and Race Continue to Influence Voting Patterns\n\nIn a striking illustration of the gender gap, likely women voters express a preference for U.S. President Joe Biden (48%), while men exhibit a tilt toward former U.S. President Donald Trump (47%).\n\n\u201cThe divergence in attitudes underscores the complex interplay of gender dynamics in shaping electoral outcomes,\u201d said Dukhong Kim, Ph.D., associate professor of political science at FAU.\n\nAmong all voters, the poll found the two candidates tied at 44% each. However, Biden demonstrates stronger support from older middle-age groups (50-64: 51%) compared to younger middle-age groups (35-39: 32%), and from Black voters (67%) in contrast to non-college-educated white voters (33%). Conversely, Trump garners more support from younger middle-aged groups (50%) compared to younger cohorts (18-34: 32%), and non-college-educated white voters (56%) compared to Black (19%) or Latino voters (37%).\n\nRegarding party allegiance, Biden and Trump both command similar levels of support: Biden (79%) and Trump (81%). However, Independents lean more toward Trump (44%) than Biden (37%).\n\nAge and Personality Matter: Biden\u2019s Age vs. Trump\u2019s Persona\n\nAs voters weigh their options, age and personality factors emerge as pivotal considerations. Although concerns over Biden\u2019s age loom large among some former supporters, critiques of Trump\u2019s language and leadership style drive others away.\n\n\u201cFor those rejecting Trump, personality factors like his language and leadership style loom large, along with legal issues stemming from the Stormy Daniels case. Presidential character remains a major fault line,\u201d said Kevin Wagner, Ph.D., co-director of FAU\u2019s PolCom Lab and professor of political science.\n\nThird-Party Intrigue: Biden\u2019s Surprising Boost with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in the Mix\n\nA surprising twist unfolds with the inclusion of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as a candidate. Contrary to expectations, Biden\u2019s support strengthens with Kennedy in the race, hinting at intriguing dynamics within the electorate.\n\nRespondents were asked, \u201cIf the election for president were held today and the candidates were Joe Biden, Donald Trump, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., which candidate would you support?\u201d Respondents answered with 40% for Biden and 38% for Trump, while 13% selected Kennedy, 6% were undecided, and 3% preferred another candidate.\n\n\u201cInterestingly, Biden actually performs better when Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is included as a candidate, likely because Kennedy pulls more support from Trump\u2019s base than Biden\u2019s,\u201d said Luzmarina Garcia, Ph.D., assistant professor of political science at FAU.\n\nNew York Criminal Trial Has Little Impact on Trump Support\n\nRespondents were asked about Trump\u2019s trial in a New York criminal case regarding accusations of falsifying business records related to a nondisclosure agreement concerning an extramarital affair. When asked about the potential impact of Trump being found guilty on their vote in the presidential election, 64% of respondents indicated it would not sway their decision, while 26% said it would. Additionally, 10% were uncertain. Among registered Republicans, 12.3% acknowledged that a guilty verdict would influence their vote, with 75.7% asserting it would not.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s New York criminal case over alleged hush money payments appears poised to have a small impact. However, since the margins in many of the battleground states are expected to be only a few points, those voters could be the difference,\u201d said Kim.\n\nThe trial\u2019s strongest impact was among younger and non-white voters. Approximately 42% of those aged 18 to 34 said a guilty verdict would influence their vote, while roughly one-third of Black, Hispanic, and other racial and ethnic voters expressed similar sentiments.\n\nEnthusiasm Edge: Democrats Gain Ground in Down-Ballot Races\n\nAmidst the electoral fray, Democrats secure a modest uptick in support among likely voters on the congressional generic ballot (43% vs. 40%). This uptick hints at a potential enthusiasm advantage for Democratic candidates, setting the stage for a fiercely contested battle in down-ballot races nationwide.\n\nThe poll was conducted from Friday, April 26 to Sunday, April 28, among a sample of 1,046 adults, 18 years of age or older, living in the U.S. The survey was conducted using text message recruitment and IVR to complete the survey. Since the text messages were sent to random registered voters, the poll can be assigned a margin of error. The survey is intended to represent the voting population in the U.S. The margin of error for the poll is +/- 3 % at the 95 % confidence level. Margins of error are higher in each subsample.\n\n-FAU-",

With this in mind, it is important to be aware of specific political activities guidelines that apply to Reserve service members.\n\n\n\nAll Service members are encouraged to undertake all acts of citizenship, including voting and participating in the political process. However, all reserve service members also have a duty to ensure that their personal activities do not imply official endorsement by the Department of Defense or Department of the Air Force. As individuals, we do not have to be politically neutral, but the Air Force does. The political activities policies outlined below help to ensure the DoD and the DAF as institutions do not influence or appear to be partisan in our nation's electoral process.\n\n\n\nDepartment of Defense Directive 1344.10, Political Activities by Members of the Armed Forces, and individual service regulations outline permitted and prohibited political activities by active duty, Reserve component, and retired service members. These rules regulate how and when service members are able to participate in the political process. Service members who violate these directives could face punishment under the Uniform Code of Military Justice and/or other criminal or administrative penalties.\n\nService members are encouraged to participate in the political process, but they must be careful about not engaging in political activities in the workplace and not using their official positions to advocate for or against political issues.

        "text": "2024 Election Spending Skyrockets\n2024 Election Spending Skyrockets\n\nApril 30, 2024\n\n\n\nThe 2024 Election is shaping up to be one of the most expensive campaign seasons in history, right on the heels of a 2020 election that involved a record level of spending.\n\nWhy it matters: Election spending is skyrocketing, from $6.5 billion in 2016 to $14.4 billion in 2020 and an expected $15.9 billion in 2024. The amount raised by each party, how early funds are raised, and how quickly they are spent can tell us a great deal about the standings of various political races, beyond the polling.\n\nHow will this affect the races?\n\nWhile there is a large amount of media focus on the financial advantage for Democrats, money does not always result in a victory.\n\nIn 2016, former Senator and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton outraised former President Donald Trump $769 million to $433 million and lost the race for the presidency.\n\nIn 2020, President Joe Biden won at the ballot box and was successful as a fundraiser, drawing $1.5 billion to Trump\u2019s $1 billion.\n\nHowever, a lack of funds can limit a candidate\u2019s ability to travel, make expensive ad-buys, and organize voter registration and engagement. Fundraising for down-ballot Senate and House races can be even more crucial, as presidential campaigns receive much more media coverage.\n\nWhere does the 2024 Presidential election stand?\n\nThe race will once again come down to the following seven states: Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Georgia, Arizona, North Carolina, and Nevada. All of these states were decided by a margin of 3% or less in the 2020 election, with Arizona and Georgia being decided by less than 0.5%. Current polling has Biden and Trump within 5% of each other in these states.\n\nBoth of the Presidential campaigns as well as Congressional campaigns are raising record amounts. The Biden campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) raised $90 million in March, while President Trump and the RNC raised $65.6 million.\n\nThe Biden campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) had $192 million cash on hand as of the end of March.\n\nThe Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee (RNC) had $93 million cash on hand late last month.\n\nThe narrative on fundraising has largely focused on Biden\u2019s significant and likely insurmountable cash advantage over the Trump campaign.\n\nThe Trump campaign spent $3.6 million on legal fees in March alone.\n\nIn March, Biden spent $29.2 million , compared with $6.3 million spent in February.\n\nA majority of the Biden campaign\u2019s spending was driven by large ad-buys after the State of the Union address, when Biden began his \u201cmonth of action\u201d travel to swing states.\n\nBiden\u2019s spending may be paying dividends. On March 1, Biden was trailing Trump by 2% in national polls and as of April 30, the two candidates are virtually tied.\n\nCongressional Outlook:\n\nPollsters and pundits have ever so slightly favored the Democrats to retake the House, while the Senate leans Republican with a very favorable GOP map. The combined national campaign committees of Republicans have raised $375 million, while the Democrats have raised $462 million.\n\nSenate: The amount raised for Senate Democratic candidates is $447 million and $273 million for the Republicans, a total of $734 million from both parties for 34 seats.\n\nCurrently, Democratic House candidates have cumulatively raised $528 million, and Republican candidates have raised $574 million.\n\nThe chart below displays each party\u2019s committee fundraising totals as well as their spending.\n\nSource: https://ballotpedia.org/Party_committee_fundraising,_2023-2024\n\nHouse and Senate Observations\n\nThe House majority will likely come down to 22 races rated as toss ups, and at this point, most political analysts believe it to be a coin flip. For an analysis and outlook on the races read here\n\nSeven seats in the Senate are rated as true \u201ctoss ups\u201d and the combined amount of money raised in those races likely will top $300 million. The toss-up seats, their fundraising, and their polling is outlined in the chart below.\n\nPolling in Senate seats is conducted less frequently than for the Presidential election, and while Democrats lead in those races, the margins are expected to tighten.\n\nHouse Fundraising\n\nWhat does this mean: The election to control the House and the Senate is going to be extremely close and any majority won by either party will likely only be by a handful of seats.\n\nPresidential Race : The race is currently a tie and will once again come down to seven states that were decided by margins of 3% or less in 2020.\n\nHouse and Senate : Both chambers will be controlled by a narrow majority, regardless of which party gains control.\n\n2024: This election will be the most expensive ever, and based on current polling is a toss-up at both the presidential and congressional level. Political spending continues to skyrocket cycle after cycle.\n\nIf you live in or near any of the seven swing states, you will almost certainly see and hear the results of all this fundraising this fall. Massive ad-buys are expected to surge after this summer\u2019s party nominating conventions.\n\nContact James Montfort (Jmonfort@crefc.org) with any questions.",

        "text": "White House considers welcoming some Palestinians from war-torn Gaza as refugees\nThe Biden administration is considering bringing certain Palestinians to the U.S. as refugees, a move that would offer a permanent safe haven to some of those fleeing war-torn Gaza, according to internal federal government documents obtained by CBS News.\n\nIn recent weeks, the documents show, senior officials across several federal U.S. agencies have discussed the practicality of different options to resettle Palestinians from Gaza who have immediate family members who are American citizens or permanent residents.\n\nOne of those proposals involves using the decades-old United States Refugee Admissions Program to welcome Palestinians with U.S. ties who have managed to escape Gaza and enter neighboring Egypt, according to the inter-agency planning documents.\n\nTop U.S. officials have also discussed getting additional Palestinians out of Gaza and processing them as refugees if they have American relatives, the documents show. The plans would require coordination with Egypt, which has so far refused to welcome large numbers of people from Gaza.\n\nThose who pass a series of eligibility, medical and security screenings would qualify to fly to the U.S. with refugee status, which offers beneficiaries permanent residency, resettlement benefits like housing assistance and a path to American citizenship.\n\nWhile the eligible population is expected to be relatively small, the plans being discussed by U.S. officials could offer a lifeline to some Palestinians fleeing the Israel-Hamas war, which local public health authorities say has claimed the lives of more than 34,000 people and displaced hundreds of thousands of civilians in Gaza.\n\nIn a statement provided to CBS News late Tuesday night, a White House spokesperson said that the U.S. \"has helped more than 1,800 American citizens and their families leave Gaza, many of whom have come to the United States. At President Biden's direction, we have also helped, and will continue to help, some particularly vulnerable individuals, such as children with serious health problems and children who were receiving treatment for cancer, get out of harm's way and receive care at nearby hospitals in the region.\"\n\nThe statement went on to say that the U.S. \"categorically rejects any actions leading to the forced relocation of Palestinians from Gaza or the West Bank or the redrawing of the borders of Gaza. The best path forward is to achieve a sustainable cease-fire through a hostage deal that will stabilize the situation and pave the way to a two-state solution.\"\n\nDisplaced Palestinians sit outside to escape the searing heat in their camp tents in Deir El-Balah, in the central Gaza Strip, on April 28, 2024. Majdi Fathi/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nThe Israeli government launched a military offensive and aerial bombardment of Gaza after Hamas staged an unprecedented attack across Israel on Oct. 7, killing roughly 1,200 people, most of them civilians. Hamas militants also abducted more than 200 people, many of whom continue to be in captivity.\n\nCBS News has also reached out Department of Homeland Security and the State Department for comment.\n\nThe proposals to resettle certain Palestinians as refugees would mark a shift in longstanding U.S. government policy and practice. Since its inception in 1980, the U.S. refugee program has not resettled Palestinians in large numbers.\n\nOver the past decade, the U.S. has resettled more than 400,000 refugees fleeing violence and war across the globe. Fewer than 600 were Palestinian. In fiscal year 2023, the U.S. welcomed 56 Palestinian refugees, or 0.09% of the more than 60,000 refugees resettled during those 12 months, State Department statistics show.\n\nWhile many Democrats would likely support the move, admitting Palestinians as refugees could spur even more political challenges for the Biden administration related to the Israel-Hamas war. The conflict has already exposed rifts within the Democratic Party, triggered massive protests on college campuses and divided communities across America.\n\nTo qualify to enter the U.S. as a refugee, applicants have to prove they are fleeing persecution based on certain factors, such as their nationality, religion or political views. While some Palestinians could say they are fleeing repression by Hamas, others could identify the military and government of Israel, a top U.S. ally and recipient of American aid, as a persecutor.\n\nThe resettlement of Palestinian refugees, even if small in scale, could also garner criticism from Republicans, who have sought to make concerns about immigration and illegal crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border defining issues in November's elections.\n\nSoon after the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas and the start of Israel's offensive in Gaza, leading Republicans, including presidential candidates, said the U.S. should not welcome Palestinian refugees, claiming that they are antisemitic and potential national security risks.\n\nIn recent years, the Biden administration has dramatically increased refugee resettlement, which was slashed to record lows by former President Donald Trump. U.S. officials have set a goal of admitting up to 125,000 refugees in fiscal year 2024, which ends at the end of September.",

It also includes exceptions for fatal foetal abnormalities and for the life of the mother.\n\nGetty Images Those seeking abortions in the south may now have to drive hundreds of miles north\n\nAbortion providers and campaigners say that many patients will fall through the cracks - that they will either be unable to travel hundreds of miles to an appointment or unable find one in already overcrowded clinics in Virginia, North Carolina and Illinois, which are now some of the nearest states where abortion is broadly available.\n\n\"There's nowhere that can absorb all of the patients that we see [in Florida], it's just not possible,\" said Amber Gavin, vice-president of advocacy at A Woman's Choice, an independent abortion clinic with a location in Jacksonville.\n\nThe new law has been welcomed by anti-abortion activists and leading state Republicans, who had lamented Florida becoming a hub for out-of-state patients.\n\n\"We don't want to be an abortion tourism destination,\" Republican Governor Ron DeSantis said last year. His office did not respond to the BBC's request for comment.\n\nMr DeSantis signed the six-week ban into law last April, but it was held up by legal challenges until last month, when a state supreme court ruling cleared the way for its enforcement.\n\nMatt Staver, founder and chairman of the Florida-based anti-abortion group Liberty Counsel told the BBC that the state could now be \"a sanctuary for life\".\n\n\"This is a great day for protecting unborn children,\" he said.\n\nMr Staver emphasised that the six-week law also includes $30m (\u00a324m) allocated each year to support pregnant women and new mothers, money that will go towards baby formula, car seats, adoption and parenting classes.\n\n\"Florida is putting its money where its mouth is and protecting mothers and their children,\" he said.\n\nAccording to March of Dimes, a non-partisan maternal health non-profit, pregnant women in Florida \"have a very high vulnerability\" to poor outcomes, with nearly a quarter of all expectant mothers receiving \"inadequate\" prenatal care.\n\nGetty Images Pro-choice supporters in Florida hope the ban can be un-done by a ballot initiative\n\nBut a second ruling from the Florida Supreme Court means the ban might be temporary.\n\nOn the same day as the court green-lit the six-week ban, it approved a ballot question that will ask voters whether to amend the state constitution to protect abortion until about 24 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nSupporters of Amendment 4 have cited internal polls suggesting it has the backing of more than 60% of Florida's voters - the threshold required to for it to pass.\n\nAnd all seven abortion ballot initiatives held in other states in the months since Roe was overturned have been successful, though most required a lower threshold and passed by just a simple majority.\n\nBoth anti-abortion and pro-choice activists have launched sweeping get-out-the-vote efforts, hoping to round up enough support before the November vote.\n\n\"The next several months are going to be very critical,\" said Liberty Counsel's Mr Staver. \"Everything is on the line with this amendment, it's a fight for life.\"\n\nPro-choice campaigners have warned that, even if Amendment 4 is passed in November, there will still have been women forced to carry unwanted or unsafe pregnancies.\n\nMichelle Quesada, of Planned Parenthood, said it is likely some of the state's clinics also will be forced to close, pushing physicians out of the state.",

        "text": "Primary Election Types\nThe laws governing primary elections are complex. The following explains general information about primary elections at the local, state, and federal levels, as well as presidential primary elections. Different states and jurisdictions have different requirements to vote and participate in a primary election. To find out more about voting in your state, visit eac.gov/vote or contact your state or local election official.\n\nIn partisan contests, primaries are used to select which candidates will represent a political party in the general election. Nonpartisan primaries are used to narrow the field of candidates for a given office. In presidential primaries, voters are generally voting for party delegates, rather than for candidates themselves. Primary elections differ from caucuses, which also determine nominees for political parties but are party-run and subject to different rules than elections. Most primaries are administered by state and local election officials, although a political party may host and administer primaries in certain circumstances. The manner in which primaries are conducted varies by state.\n\nSpreadsheet of State Primary Types and Associated Election Laws\n\nNonpartisan Primaries\n\nNonpartisan primaries are elections where candidates run with no party affiliation on the ballot. If a candidate for nonpartisan office does not win with a certain threshold (typically 50%), then the candidates with the highest number of votes advance to a general or run-off election. In some states, nonpartisan contests and ballot issues may be included on the same ballot as partisan contests. In other states, partisan contests are on a separate ballot.\n\nImage\n\nOpen Partisan Primary & Open to Unaffiliated Voters\n\n44% of states have either an open partisan primary election or one that is open to unaffiliated voters. Open partisan primary elections generally allow all voters to participate, regardless of their political affiliation. Some states require voters to publicly declare their choice of party ballot at the polling place, after which the poll worker provides or activates the appropriate ballot. Other states allow the voters to make their choice of party ballot within the privacy of the voting booth.\n\nImage\n\nPartially Closed & Partially Open Partisan Primaries\n\n26% of states have either a partially closed or partially open partisan primary. In partially closed partisan primary elections, state parties decide whether they permit voters registered without a political party affiliation to participate in their primary elections. In partially open partisan primary elections, voters are generally allowed to vote for candidates with a different party than they are affiliated, but they must declare their party choice or their party selection may change their party affiliation.\n\nImage\n\nClosed Partisan Primary\n\n20% of states, as well as D.C. have a closed partisan primary. In general, closed partisan primary elections are elections in which only voters affiliated with the political party holding the primary are eligible to participate and voters receive a ballot listing only those candidates running for office for the nomination of the political party with which the voters are affiliated.\n\nImage\n\n\u201cMulti-Party\u201d Partisan Primaries & Other Primary Modes\n\n10% of states have other modes of holding their partisan primary elections that do not fit into open or closed categories. Some of these states have a \"top-two\" or \u201ctop-four\u201d partisan format, where all voters receive a ballot with all candidates, regardless of the party affiliation or the voters or candidates. The two or four candidates with the highest number of votes advance to the general election, even if they have the same party affiliation. Other states have unique rules for conducting their primary election.\n\n17-year-olds\n\nAlthough the federal voting age is 18, over 20 states allow citizens who are 17 but will be 18 by the general election to vote in primary elections. Some states allow 17-year-olds to participate in local and state primaries only, while other states allow 17-year-olds to also vote in congressional primaries. In addition, 17-year-olds may be allowed to vote in presidential primaries or caucuses, depending on state law and political party rules.",

        "text": "2024 United States presidential election in Arkansas\nThe 2024 United States presidential election in Arkansas took place on Tuesday, November 5, 2024, as part of the 2024 United States elections in which all 50 states plus the District of Columbia will participate. Arkansas voters chose electors to represent them in the Electoral College via a popular vote. The state of Arkansas has six electoral votes in the Electoral College, following reapportionment due to the 2020 United States census in which the state neither gained nor lost a seat.[1]\n\nAlthough former Democratic President Bill Clinton hails from the state and comfortably won it in both of his election bids in 1992 and 1996, Arkansas is a Southern state in the Bible Belt that has trended strongly towards the Republican Party in the 21st century, with Al Gore (from neighboring Tennessee) losing the state in 2000 by 5.45%. The last Democratic presidential candidate to come within single digits of carrying Arkansas, or even win more than 40% of the state vote, was John Kerry in 2004. The state's rightward shift continued under Barack Obama, leading to Arkansas becoming a Republican stronghold at the presidential level. In 2008, Obama became the first Democrat to win without carrying Arkansas despite decisively winning nationwide.\n\nThe GOP's popularity in Arkansas has become so pronounced that the state turned sharply against former First Lady of Arkansas Hillary Clinton in 2016, favoring Republican Donald Trump by 26.9%. Trump again easily won the state again by 27.6% in 2020.

        "text": "PUBLIC CONVERSATION: The 2024 Elections in South Africa and the United States\nPosted on May 01, 2024\n\nSouth Africa and the United States both have the most consequential elections in their political history in 2024. For example, in South Africa, the ruling African National Congress (ANC) may, for the first time since 1994, fail to win over 50% of the votes and this would force a coalition of parties to form a government in South Africa which the ANC may not even be involved in. In the US, the November elections could go either way between the ruling Democrat Party and opposition Republican Party with the race too close to call between the presidential candidates of both parties. Either way, unless the ruling parties win the elections in South Africa and the US, any other outcome on either side would have serious consequence for relations between countries for the next 4 years. This moderated conversation between experienced both election analysts with inputs from the audience will shed light on the consequential nature of these elections for both countries and Africa broadly.\n\n\n\nDate: Tuesday, 7 May 2024\n\nTime: 15:00 - 16:30\n\nVenue: Merensky Library Auditorium, Hatfield Campus\n\nEnquiries: Ms Lerato Dube: +27 12 420 2034; [email protected]\n\nRegistration: click here\n\n",

        "text": "Social Media\u2019s Influence on the 2024 Presidential Election\nSocial media has become a primary method of campaigning, as candidates have shifted away from the traditional \u2018shaking hands and kissing babies\u2019 methodology. Its influence has been at the forefront of conversations as we march closer to November and the 2024 Presidential Election.\n\nIt will be a rematch of four years ago between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Both have now served one term each and are fighting for a second.\n\nLoyola Communications Professor Dr. Amy Becker specializes in political entertainment and public opinion and discussed why the upcoming election is of utmost importance.\n\n\u201cI think the election is of added importance given recent threats to democracy and increasing distrust of politicians and the media. I think we are seeing a real choice between democratic norms and autocracy around the globe,\u201d Dr. Becker said.\n\nSocial media is a more recent method of addressing the public on the campaign trail. It allows candidates to distribute information and campaign as well as serving as a news source for voters.\n\nPew Research Center analysis of surveys conducted between October 2019 and June 2020 found that 18.8% of U.S. adults get their political news primarily through social media.\n\nBut not only has social media become a primary source of news, but it also has impacted the outcome of previous elections.\n\nAccording to a study done by Princeton University, \u201cTwitter lowered the Republican vote share in the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections but had limited effects on Congressional elections and previous presidential elections. Evidence from survey data, primary elections, and text analysis of millions of tweets suggests that Twitter\u2019s relatively liberal content may have persuaded voters with moderate views to vote against Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nWith these findings, it is evident that the content candidates put out could potentially make or break one\u2019s presidential hopes.\n\nFor college students, social media is a way to consume news and information in a timely manner. Jaylynn Lawlah \u201924 is a Communications major and has social media expertise through being on the Student Government Association\u2019s Marketing Committee. She labeled social media as her initial platform for receiving content regarding politics.\n\n\u201cI would say that I do rely on social media when making decisions about a candidate. As a college student with a busy schedule, it often-times becomes hard to find time to watch the news or to do research to learn more about a candidate. I find social media to be helpful in terms of making me aware of who is running and giving me a general idea of what the candidate stands for.\u201d Lawlah said.\n\nDr. Becker further discussed the importance of social media and how it influences today\u2019s average voter, particularly young voters like Lawlah.\n\n\u201cSocial media is an important source of information for the average voter, particularly for younger folks who prefer to get their information from social media over traditional news sources. We also only then see news sources and content that agree with our point of view. In addition, there are many who lack the ability to separate truth from misinformation or disinformation,\u201d Dr. Becker said.\n\nMisinformation and disinformation are difficult to decipher in general but doing so over social media can prove even harder. Lawlah feels that when viewing content on social media, it is the individual\u2019s responsibility to conduct any external research.\n\n\u201cWhen I think that a certain candidate is especially important to pay attention to, I will do my own research, like going on their website, so that I can get first-hand knowledge of the candidate, rather than a summary from a news source. The last time I did that was for Maryland\u2019s 2022 governor race,\u201d Lawlah said.\n\nSocial media has created a new platform for users to receive news, however, it has also allowed political candidates to gain exposure. Political candidates have utilized social media as a way to constantly gain an upper hand, even if that means sharing content that mocks other candidates.\n\n\u201cI think you can compare it in some ways to negative TV ads from past election cycles. I also think Trump\u2019s personality is pretty unique and he\u2019s more combative and willing to go on the attack than traditional candidates. Biden then needs to respond with attacks rather than just let Trump\u2019s attacks continue without a response,\u201d Becker said.\n\nTo further track the validity of political candidates\u2019 statements as the United States inches closer to November\u2019s election, head to Politifact.",

        "text": "Janus Forum and Darrell West Lecture focus on American election integrity, impact, and data\nIn preparation for the upcoming presidential election, Miami University hosted two speaking events that brought three different experts on American elections to Oxford.\n\nFor the biannual Janus Forum on April 15, Mick Mulvaney, chief of staff to former President Trump, and Tiffany Muller, president of End Citizens United and Let America Vote, debated the influence big money has on American elections.\n\nThe following day, the Department of Political Science invited Tyler Synclair \u201813, founder of TGS Insights and former chief research officer for the Morning Consult, to speak at the Darrell West Lecture In American Politics: \u201cIssues, Opinions and Data Driving the Election.\u201d\n\nBought and Paid For? Money, Speech, and Elections in America\n\nGrace Gaston, Tiffany Muller, Mick Mulvaney, and\n\nJanus Forum student president Cameron\n\nTiefenthaler\n\nMulvaney and Muller met from opposite sides of the Janus Forum stage to discuss how \u201cbig money\u201d influences American politics. Muller opened the debate by explaining what her role entailed.\n\n\u201cOur mission is really simple \u2013 we are trying to get \u2018big money\u2019 out of politics,\u201d said Muller. \u201cOur members are united behind the belief that if your voices are heard in our political system, then real change is possible.\u201d\n\nMulvaney responded by addressing the idea that money equals corruption. He said that this is not accurate and Washington is not broken.\n\nStudent moderator Grace Gaston, a junior Political Science, Individualized Studies, and Gender Studies major, guided the two guests through a series of questions, beginning with how financing laws impact integrity in governmental processes.\n\nMulvaney discussed what the 2010 Citizens United decision, a Supreme Court case that overturned restrictions on independent expenditures by corporations in government campaigns, meant to him as a congressional candidate.\n\n\u201cI ran four times, and let me tell you what Citizens United did for me \u2013 not a thing,\u201d said Mulvaney. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t impact how I run a race.\u201d\n\nMuller countered by discussing the first two questions an individual must consider when running for office: how much money can be raised and if the candidate has the ability to take 18 months off work.\n\n\u201cThis is why we end up with a Congress that doesn\u2019t represent America,\u201d said Muller. \u201c50% of them are millionaires, and it is disproportionately male, white, and old.\u201d\n\nBoth guests then debated what measures can be taken to reduce the amount of \u201cbig money\u201d in politics, the influence of foreign money in US elections, and the concern surrounding AI-generated \u201cdeep fakes\u201d in American elections.\n\n\u201cThis might be a place in which we agree,\u201d said Muller. \u201cThe use of AI is of great concern for election security. Both sides have some concerns, and I hope that we can address and have some steps taken.\u201d\n\nKirsten Osteboe, a sophomore Diplomacy and Global Politics major, felt that she benefited greatly from attending the debate and appreciated that the discourse was lighthearted and respectful.\n\n\u201cIt was a really productive conversation in which both individuals were unafraid to agree with each other when it comes to topics that are harmful to our political system,\u201d said Osteboe. \u201cThis topic is highly controversial [in the next election], and it was really important to hear two sides of the topic to understand the role it plays in politics.\u201d\n\nThe Janus Forum, through the Department of Political Science and the Menard Family Center for Democracy, aims to bring experts to debate important issues for the sake of increasing civil literacy among Miami students, allowing them to form their own opinions on current issues.\n\nThe next Janus Forum will be hosted during the fall of 2024. Students interested in getting involved can contact Grace Gaston at gastongm@MiamiOH.edu or Minnie Warfield at warfiemc@MiamiOH.edu.\n\nAnalyzing the importance of data concerning elections and current issues\n\nThis year\u2019s Darrell West Lecture, featuring Tyler Sinclair \u201813, was part of a series of events celebrating the Department of Political Science\u2019s 100-year anniversary.\n\n\u201cThe Darrell West Lecture in American Politics series is designed to bring political issues and policies in front of our students so they can think critically about them,\u201d said Bryan Marshall, professor and chair of the Department of Political Science. \u201cThat way students can be informed and consider solutions that make a meaningful difference in the future.\u201d\n\nSinclair sought audience participation from the start by opening with a knock-knock joke. His goal, he explained, was to share the importance of basic statistical literacy in politics, which he learned as a Miami student.\n\nHe asked students, through a show of hands, to share what they thought about the performance and favorability of the 2024 candidates, President Joe Biden and Donald Trump. He then provided data collected through various polls about the favorability of former presidents, specifically starting from January of their re-election year.\n\nThrough comparing different survey responses from various polls like you.gov and Gallop, Sinclair was able to highlight differences in responses.\n\n\u201cMinor changes in wording can elicit different responses on how folks view the issue,\u201d Sinclair said.\n\nHe also explained that whether or not the survey has answer choices to select from and what those choices are can sway how people respond.\n\n\u201cWhen folks are not given a chance to say \u2018unsure,\u2019 it could mean a lot of different things,\u201d he said. He added that it is difficult to say with 100% confidence that data shows specific things when it comes to self-reported answers. Respondents can be swayed to answer a certain way, may not have a strong opinion, or overreport what they think.\n\n\u201cDuring election season, a lot of information and stats are being thrown out by the media,\u201d Sinclair said. \u201cThere are going to be a lot of headlines we won\u2019t have time to think critically about leading up to the election, so it is important to know how to decipher what is reliable and statistically significant.\u201d\n\nSinclair finished his talk by allowing questions from the audience. Through his use of examples and explanations of data, students were able to walk out of the lecture with more knowledge about data and its importance, particularly when it comes to how elections play out.\n\n\u201cIn general, I think folks anticipate a close 2024 contest much like 2020, in many of the same states, and for many of the same reasons,\u201d Sinclair said.",

        "text": "The Challenges of News Reporting in an Election Year\nHenri Campe\u00e3\n\nJelani Cobb, the dean of Columbia Journalism School, Peabody Award\u2013winning filmmaker, and longtime staff writer at the New Yorker, discusses the complexities of journalism in 2024.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing like a presidential-election year to fire up the media. Does this mean people will be paying more attention to news? And does journalism still shape voters\u2019 thinking on issues?\n\nI do think people will be paying attention to news; they\u2019re already paying attention. And yes, journalism does shape the way voters think about issues, but it no longer shapes it as it once did. Today\u2019s journalists are competing with information sources from all over the spectrum, many of which are not reliable, not vetted, not professional. So the perspectives people have on what happens in the election will realistically be some combination of information they receive from high-quality, vetted news sources and an array of misinformation and disinformation that has proliferated since the 2016 election.\n\nOne hypothesis about this glut of mis- and disinformation is that it arises from the siloing of news consumers around dubious sources that simply echo their own preconceptions.\n\nSiloing and people\u2019s reliance on news that most closely conforms to their worldview is certainly one factor. That has been a problem going back a century or more, to the days of the \u201cnewspaper wars,\u201d when even smaller American cities had several daily newspapers, each aimed exclusively at a specific type of reader who disliked and distrusted the readers of all the competing newspapers. That pattern continues, and has intensified, in the digital age. But the other factor is the dearth of information, period. We are dealing with the siloing problem in the context of news deserts. Increasingly, in communities all over the country, citizens have no access to local news. That exacerbates the problem.\n\nThese news deserts presumably reflect the financial struggles of the news business across all media. Dwindling advertising revenue has triggered layoffs, cutbacks, and outright shutdowns at hundreds of media outlets. Is there a positive side to this grim picture?\n\nThe challenges to journalism are significant, there\u2019s no doubt about that. And yes, the predominant concern is resources. But even as we\u2019re grappling with these difficulties, we\u2019re also seeing an unprecedented level of innovation. It\u2019s important to keep track of that. We have an emerging and vital nonprofit sector in journalism. News organizations such as Documented [a nonprofit digital-news site focused on immigration founded by Max Siegelbaum \u201916JRN and Mazin Sidahmed \u201916JRN] are experimenting with novel methods of dissemination, sending out targeted information to their readers by text message. We have not seen this much innovation on the technical side of news in easily a century.\n\nWe still need to figure out how to create sustainable news organizations outside the ecosystem of social media, but there are success stories. The Texas Tribune is the nonprofit news website that people point to most commonly, but there\u2019s also VTDigger in Vermont and Sahan Journal in Minnesota [founded by Mukhtar M. Ibrahim \u201917JRN], among others. These are news organizations that have sprung up in the aftermath of a serious decline in institutional news in those locations. They have broken news, covered important stories, and figured out how to staff up and find a stable financial model through a combination of philanthropy, memberships, and public events.\n\nOne phenomenon that is constantly invoked in discussions of journalism today is the lack of trust consumers have in so-called \u201cmainstream media.\u201d Where does that come from?\n\nThe decline of trust is tied to a couple of dynamics, one of which is the decline of local news. While polls reveal decreasing trust in local news, the level of distrust is not nearly as high as it is with national news. That\u2019s because local news is local. The person who reported a story might have a kid in the same class at school as your kid, or the editor is somebody you went to high school with. There\u2019s that network of personal ties. Also, in these small markets, it\u2019s imperative that the news organization keep all its readers or viewers in its fold, so polarization is much less likely to happen.\n\nThomas Jefferson had this idea of American democracy as fundamentally local. In many ways, Jefferson\u2019s idea has held up over time. The crisis of trust in journalism is really a crisis of local news organizations. As I\u2019ve said elsewhere, we saw a similar crisis of trust in medicine during the pandemic. Part of that is due to the fact that one hundred million people in the United States do not have access to a primary-care physician. In other words, those people lack any kind of local relationship with the medical establishment. It\u2019s easy for people to become skeptical about large, anonymous institutions. That\u2019s the real driver of the lack of trust in media. The great preponderance of this situation is driven by the dearth of those local, individual connections people make with the news they consume. When local news goes away, trust goes with it.\n\nThe other factor with trust is related to what everyone saw with the George Santos fiasco in Congress. The big question was, how could this happen? These gigantic lies he told about his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, his name, his background \u2014 all these fundamental things. How can anyone trust a press that missed all that? Of course, the real problem, as most journalists will tell you, is rarely the big lies. The most pernicious lies are small, where someone shades a number on a spreadsheet or skews some data about how carcinogenic a particular chemical in a product may be. And to notice discrepancies of that sort requires a kind of meticulous, detail-oriented reporting that takes time and, again, resources.\n\nJelani Cobb\n\nYou link local news to Jeffersonian ideas of democracy, and of course the nation\u2019s founders believed a free, unfettered press was essential to democracy. Can you elaborate on this relationship?\n\nI think Americans have largely adopted a seventh-grade social-studies idea of journalism\u2019s connection to democracy: we believe in some general, vague way that an informed public is a good thing. But because we have tended to think of American democracy as unassailable, we have relegated to the background the real, hard ethical questions about how a pro-democracy press operates. And those questions are fundamental. Do we really benefit society by giving the horse-race version of a political story? Do we further polarization by covering politics the way we cover sports? If there are Yankees fans who loathe Red Sox fans and vice versa, there\u2019s no fundamental societal concern there. It becomes a thornier issue when people of opposing political parties view each other with that same sort of unabashed contempt. We haven\u2019t given enough thought to those kinds of concerns \u2014 even when it comes to practical matters, such as how do we cover a disputed election? When do we call something a lie? That was a question we fumbled in the last election cycle, among the many others we had to think about.\n\nSo how does one practice journalism in the true interests of democracy?\n\nJournalism must be about the facts. It must have objectivity. And we\u2019ve had a lot of debate and consternation about objectivity. Objectivity does not require that we treat people\u2019s arguments or statements as if they have an equality of merit . It requires that there be equality of scrutiny.\n\n\u201cWe may have different structures, different technologies, different approaches, different ethics. But skeptical inquiry into facts that have been obscured from the public is what we do. That is the business we\u2019re in.\u201d\n\nAre you referring to the so-called false equivalence that the press is often accused of adhering to \u2014 blindly treating two sides in a debate as equally legitimate?\n\nYes, that\u2019s part of the problem. The other part is that we should be drilling down on policy, not personality, looking not at whether a public figure won the week or messaged effectively but at the issues they\u2019re talking about and the implications of what they\u2019re saying about those issues. Margaret Sullivan, my colleague at the journalism school, has talked a great deal about this. When I became dean, I launched the slogan \u201cReporting begins here.\u201d This commitment has been a remarkably consistent mainstay of this institution for the 112 years it has existed. We teach reporting, and the fundamental skills of reporting have remained the same. We may have different structures, different technologies, different approaches, different ethics. But skeptical inquiry into facts that have been obscured from the public is what we do. That is the business we\u2019re in.\n\nSo why has journalism devolved into the horse race and the false equivalence?\n\nI think that initially, especially with covering politics, taking a sports-like approach seemed a novel way to get people interested in civic concerns that they might not otherwise pay attention to \u2014 but with the result that we became a more divided society. And some of this false equivalence is done to preserve access, because if you say something critical about an elected official or point out an inconsistency, that person may not talk to you and your colleagues again.\n\nOver the last two presidential election cycles, many news outlets benefited from what some called the \u201cTrump bump.\u201d Out of love or hate, people were interested in Donald Trump, and reader-ship, viewership, and subscriptions went up. So news outlets bombarded the public with Trump content, positive and negative. How does journalism hang on to its core values in such a situation?\n\nThere\u2019s no guarantee that will happen again in this election cycle. But people were more likely to read what the New York Times was saying or to tune in to a particular news station or podcast because there was a great deal of alarm and concern. Fear is often good for circulation. That\u2019s a conflict of interest that\u2019s been baked into most of our media systems from the outset. The profit incentive may not align with the ethical and democratic incentives. We are concerned these days about the ownership of news organizations, and certainly about the kind of hedge-fund takeovers that have resulted, in many instances, in the stripping down of newspapers for parts. Yet the wealthy have owned American news media for a long time. The Columbia Journalism School is housed in Pulitzer Hall, a building created and funded by an extremely wealthy and powerful newspaper magnate. This concern is not new.\n\nSo if conflicts of interest are built into almost every journalism model we have, what is the solution?\n\nWe need lots of different models. We need nonprofit papers. We need public media. We need large media. We need small, local, independent media. We need all kinds of different media structures. Here\u2019s a parallel I use involving election polls: You have ten polls, and all of them are flawed in some way, but not in the same way. The best thing you can do in this case is to average those polls. By averaging them, you minimize the weight of any individual flaw. That\u2019s what we have to do with our news organizations. We have all these models; none of them is perfect. But if we have an assortment of many different competing models, the shortcomings of any one model are minimized.\n\nLet\u2019s turn to content. The New York Times is currently enjoying great success by offering readers an expansive range of coverage that runs from hard news and opinion pieces to stories on beauty, fashion, celebrities, and health \u2014 not to mention an ever-expanding universe of daily word games. Many Times loyalists bemoan this \u201csoftening\u201d of serious journalism. What\u2019s your take?\n\nI\u2019m keenly aware, as I mentioned, that our journalism school was founded by Joseph Pulitzer \u201952HON. The gem of Pulitzer\u2019s newspaper empire was the New York World, a paper known for its hard-hitting investigative journalism. Do you know what one of its greatest innovations was? Its cartoons. Readers loved the World\u2019s cartoons, and the World splurged on them, paying top fees to the best, funniest artists to create them, because management knew they attracted readers. Even in the best of times, the most respected newspapers published horoscopes and other quotidian, not at all lofty, elements. These innovations were immensely profitable. But the fact is, those daily, reliable features \u2014 the lifestyle, the sports coverage \u2014 build loyalty and help forge the kind of relationship with a reader that allows them to believe a newspaper when it reports that a city-council member is taking bribes.\n\nRecently, people became alarmed and angry that, for instance, USA Today hired a Taylor Swift reporter. But readers have a variety of interests, and the ability to get their recipes, their dating advice, their celebrity news \u2014 all the information that pertains to the multiple areas of their lives \u2014 is part of the entire experience of what news organizations provide.\n\nOne focus of Columbia Journalism School is climate reporting, which you\u2019ve said needs to be incorporated into every aspect of journalism today. Can you explain?\n\nWhen we think about the big challenges on the horizon, climate is number one, globally. But one of the errors I think news organizations made when they first started covering this issue was to assign the topic to a dedicated climate reporter, as if climate only happened in one place. Now, there\u2019s nothing wrong with having a dedicated climate reporter \u2014 it\u2019s a great idea, actually. But this approach overlooked the extent to which stories being covered elsewhere in that news outlet were also climate stories. So many stories are climate-\n\nrelated! When you look at labor and the labor market \u2014 one of our Columbia Journalism Investigations teams did a series on this \u2014 a serious problem right now is the spiking number of outdoor workers who are dying of heat exhaustion. That\u2019s a labor story, but it\u2019s also a climate story. When you look at migration and immigration, you\u2019re often seeing refugees escaping the effects of climate change, so if you\u2019re covering immigration, you need to have an understanding of climate change in your toolkit. The economy, too. Think about all the ways that climate is affecting agriculture. Or global health worldwide. There is no story in which climate doesn\u2019t have its invisible hand somewhere.\n\nThe physical threats to journalists seem to be increasing, despite the fact that journalists covering conflict are supposedly protected by international law. Is this danger perception or reality?\n\nIt is real. The Committee to Protect Journalists has noted that, even before the hostilities broke out between Hamas and Israel, the number of journalists killed in 2023 was already far above the previous year\u2019s number. Journalists have died in Mexico; they have died in Ukraine. We\u2019ve also seen a generally more hostile attitude toward journalists in India. It\u2019s important to keep track of that. And not only are those deaths a tragedy, but they are also a barometer of the crackdowns on civil rights and civil liberties in those places where journalists are reporting.\n\nWe teach our journalism students about mechanisms for remaining safe in the midst of conflict. Those calculations constantly change, but what hasn\u2019t changed is the fact that journalism has always been a dangerous undertaking. The field is becoming more complicated and more trying for those who practice it, but fortunately there are still plenty of dedicated journalists all over the world who are willing to put themselves out there \u2014 often at the risk of physical harm \u2014 to get the story that will help readers, viewers, or listeners understand what\u2019s going on in the world around them.",

        "text": "Election 2024: Trump Talks Foreign Policy With Time Magazine\nTime magazine made news this week with a cover story based on two interviews with Donald Trump. The media\u2019s coverage of the interviews has focused heavily on what Trump said about abortion (states can monitor pregnant women to make sure they don\u2019t have abortions), undocumented immigrants (they \u201caren\u2019t civilians\u201d and can be rounded up by the U.S. military), and the January 6 rioters (he would \u201cabsolutely\u201d consider pardoning them).\n\nWhat got much less attention was what Trump said about foreign policy. And he said a lot. He confirmed that he is an ardent protectionist, suggested he is not the isolationist he is often made out to be, and frequently did violence to the facts to support his views.\n\nTrump began his foray into foreign policy by repeating his pledge to impose a 10 percent tariff on all imports and a more-than-60 percent tariff on all Chinese imports:\n\nI call it a ring around the country. We have a ring around the country. A reciprocal tax also, in addition to what we said. And if we do that, the numbers are staggering. I don't believe it will have much of an effect because they're making so much money off of us. I also don't believe that the costs will go up that much. And a lot of people say, \u201cOh, that's gonna be a tax on us.\u201d I don't believe that. I think it's a tax on the country that's doing it. And I know. Look, I took in billions of dollars from China. Nobody else ever did anything on China.\n\nThe Water's Edge James M.

While Chinese exporters may cut their prices to defray the cost of tariffs, all the money that the U.S. government gets from tariffs comes from individuals and firms in the United States.\n\nTrump went on to insist that sharply higher tariffs won\u2019t spur inflation. When the Time reporter said that calculations showed that his \u201ctrade war with China cost the U.S. economy $316 billion and 300,000 jobs,\u201d Trump replied that his critics don\u2019t \u201cknow what they\u2019re talking about.\u201d He also said he didn\u2019t think that U.S. businesses would pass their higher import costs along to their customers, though he didn\u2019t explain why they wouldn\u2019t. Businesses, after all, are looking to make a profit, not protect their customers\u2019 wallets. He instead argued that tariffs would eventually encourage domestic production. That could happen, but as the history of protection of the U.S. steel industry shows, it is hardly guaranteed.\n\nWhen the topic turned to the Middle East, Trump repeated his claim that October 7 would not have happened had he been president and said that Iran didn\u2019t engage in terrorism on his watch. The former claim is debatable, the latter claim is flat wrong. Trump said he once supported a two-state solution between Israelis and Palestinians, but expressed understandable skepticism about its feasibility today:\n\nThere was a time when I thought two states could work. Now I think two states is going to be very, very tough. I think it's going to be much tougher to get. I also think you have fewer people that liked the idea. You had a lot of people that liked the idea four years ago. Today, you have far fewer people that like that idea.\n\nThe reporter didn\u2019t press Trump on what the alternative was to the two-state solution, but did ask Trump if he would go to war to protect Israel. The former president answered: \u201cI have been very loyal to Israel, more loyal than any other president. I've done more for Israel than any other president. Yeah, I will protect Israel.\u201d\n\nAsked about NATO, Trump repeated his frequent claim that when he became president, NATO \u201chad no cash, they were dying, we were spending almost 100% of the money on NATO. We were protecting Europe. And they weren't even paying.\u201d While most NATO members in 2017 had not made good on their 2014 pledge to spend at least 2 percent of their GDP on defense by 2024, that didn\u2019t mean that Europe spent nothing on its defense.\n\nTrump went on to suggest that he wasn\u2019t looking to withdraw the United States from NATO as much as he was seeking to get NATO members to pull their weight:\n\nI said to them, if you don't pay, enjoy yourselves, but we're not going to protect you. I said it again a few weeks ago, two months ago, I said it again. And I said it, that if you don't pay. Look, that's the way you talk as a negotiator. I'm negotiating because I want them to pay. I want Europe to pay. I want nothing bad to happen to Europe, I love Europe, I love the people of Europe, I have a great relationship with Europe. But they've taken advantage of us, both on NATO and on Ukraine. We're in for billions of dollars more than they're in in Ukraine. It shouldn't be that way.\n\nTrump added that \u201cNATO is fine. See, the problem I have with NATO is, I don't think that NATO would come to our defense if we had a problem.\u201d NATO\u2019s Article 5 self-defense provision has been invoked just once, after the United States was attacked on 9/11. More than two dozen NATO members lost servicemen or women fighting alongside U.S. troops in Afghanistan.\n\nTrump also threw Ukraine a potential lifeline. When asked whether he would \u201ccontinue to provide military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine,\u201d his response essentially was, \u201cit depends\u201d:\n\nI\u2019m going to try and help Ukraine, but Europe has to get there also and do their job. They're not doing their job. Europe is not paying their fair share.\n\nTrump also knocked down the claim made by Hungarian President Victor Orban that he wouldn\u2019t give Ukraine \u201ca penny\u201d if he returned to the White House:\n\nNo, I said I wouldn't give unless Europe starts equalizing. They have to come. Europe has to pay. We are in for so much more than the European nations. It's very unfair to us. And I said if Europe isn't going to pay, who are gravely more affected than we are. If Europe is not going to pay, why should we pay?\n\nTrump\u2019s answer implied that paying a fair share means Europe needs to spend as much on Ukraine as the United States does. By that standard, Europeans have met the test. Europe is already providing Ukraine with more military and humanitarian aid than the United States has. Europe has also absorbed six million Ukrainian refugees and paid much higher energy prices to punish Russia for its aggression. Conversely, as Europeans like to point out, their switch to liquid natural gas imported from the United States has been a boon to U.S. producers and shippers.\n\nThe interview moved on to Asia. Trump was asked if the United States should defend Taiwan against a Chinese invasion. His answer restated official U.S. policy and could have been taken from an interview with any president dating back to Jimmy Carter:\n\nWell, I\u2019ve been asked this question many times and I always refuse to answer it because I don't want to reveal my cards to a wonderful reporter like you. But no. China knows my answer very well. But they have to understand that things like that can\u2019t come easy. But I will say that I have never publicly stated, although I want to, because I wouldn\u2019t want to give away any negotiating abilities by giving information like that to any reporter.\n\nTrump then went on to say something that further complicates the \u201cTrump-is-an-isolationist\u201d commentary:\n\nThat\u2019s a policy of the United States. It\u2019s to help various countries that are in trouble.\n\nThe interview closed with Trump being asked if he would withdraw U.S. troops from South Korea. He answered:\n\nWe have 40,000 troops that are in a precarious position. And I told South Korea that it's time that you step up and pay. They\u2019ve become a very wealthy country. We've essentially paid for much of their military, free of charge. And they agreed to pay billions of dollars. And now, probably now that I\u2019m gone, they're paying very little. I don't know if you know that they renegotiated the deal I made. And they're paying very little.\n\nThe United States actually has 28,500 troops in South Korea, and the U.S. taxpayer does not underwrite the South Korean military. South Korea has the world\u2019s eleventh largest military budget, spending nearly $50 billion annually. The Biden administration negotiated a deal in 2021 that increased South Korea\u2019s annual support for U.S. military forces in the country to $1 billion, a nearly 14 percent increase over what Seoul paid in the final two years of Trump\u2019s administration.\n\nSo what did we learn from Trump\u2019s interview? As always, he sees the United States as a sucker preyed upon by friends and allies. He makes claims that collapse under even the lightest scrutiny and swats away contrary evidence. And he wants to impose tariffs that will upend the global economy and likely cost the U.S. economy\u2014and American workers\u2014dearly.\n\nBut he also isn\u2019t dedicated to the isolationist dream of making America \u201ccome home.\u201d He instead wants to be the dealmaker who corrects the balance sheet with America\u2019s friends, partners, and allies. His heavy-handed tactics, skewed vision of the costs of U.S. engagement overseas, and refusal to entertain facts contrary to his America-as-victim worldview could, and likely will, mean that any such deals will come only after considerable drama and turbulence. But with a bit of luck and some successful diplomacy by U.S. allies and partners, NATO and other U.S. alliances may avoid the chopping block in a potential second Trump presidency.\n\nCampaign Update\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. announced on Monday that he will appear on California\u2019s ballot in November as the nominee of the American Independent Party (AIP). The AIP was founded in 1967 and has a long history of running segregationists, like Alabama Governor George Wallace in 1968 and Georgia Governor Lester Maddox in 1976. Kennedy defended his decision to run on behalf of a party with that history by saying that it had undergone a \u201crebirth\u201d and was using \u201cits independent ballot line for good.\u201d\n\nThe Candidates in Their Own Words\n\nThe Biden campaign responded to Trump\u2019s Time magazine interview by releasing a video of the president criticizing what Trump said. The topic President Joe Biden chose to attack wasn\u2019t one of Trump\u2019s ruminations about foreign policy. It was instead his answer on abortion. The choice signaled the Biden campaign\u2019s assessment of what matters to voters.\n\nBiden created a flap with his remarks at campaign fundraiser on Wednesday night when he said:\n\nLook, think about it. Why is China stalling so badly economically? Why is Japan having trouble? Why is Russia? Why is India? Because they\u2019re xenophobic. They don\u2019t want immigrants.\n\nThe remarks likely didn\u2019t win Biden any points with officials in India or Japan. White House spokesperson John Kirby argued that there was nothing to see here: \u201cHe\u2019s making a broader point about this country, our country. Our allies know very well how much the president respects them.\u201d\n\nRobert F. Kennedy challenged Biden to take a \u201cno-spoiler pledge.\u201d It would require Biden to drop out of the race if an October 2024 poll of thirty-thousand Americans showed that Kennedy has a better chance of defeating Trump than Biden does. There is a zero-percent chance that Biden will accept the challenge. It is equally unlikely that any reputable polling organization will try to poll thirty thousand Americans. Most national polls survey fewer than fifteen hundred people. In any event, U.S. presidential elections aren\u2019t decided by the national popular vote. They are determined by the outcome of fifty state elections and one district election. The two don\u2019t necessarily correlate, as Trump can attest.\n\nCornel West appeared on Pierce Morgan Uncensored on Wednesday and renewed his criticism of how Israel has prosecuted its war on Hamas: \u201cYou've got genocide taking place... You've got IDF terrorism taking place. You can't say a mumbling word about 12 universities that have been leveled to the ground. Hundreds and hundreds of professors have been killed, students have been killed.\"\n\nWhat the Pundits Are Saying\n\nIn the latest on the Trump vice-presidential sweepstakes, Axios\u2019 Sophia Cai and Juliegrace Brufke reported that North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum has caught Trump\u2019s eye. Trump, who hosted Burgum for Easter brunch, \u201csees Burgum as reliable and low-drama,\u201d according to Trump insiders.\n\nCharles Homans argued in the New York Times Magazine that Trump is using significantly darker political rhetoric than he did in 2016 or 2020. Looking at a speech that Trump gave last November on how \u201c2024 is our final battle,\u201d Homans concluded: \u201cNo major American presidential candidate has talked like this\u2014not Richard Nixon, not George Wallace, not even Trump himself. Before November 2020, his speeches, for all their boundary crossings, stopped short of the language of \u2018vermin\u2019 and \u2018enemies within.\u201d\n\nJonathan Allen, Carole E. Lee, and Katherine Doyle reported for NBC News that the Biden administration is annoyed that Trump has been meeting so many foreign leaders. \u201cIn less than two months, Trump has hosted Polish President Andrzej Duda, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, former Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso and David Cameron, the former British prime minister who now serves as the U.K.\u2019s foreign secretary. He\u2019s also talked with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and others by phone. It\u2019s not unusual for a party nominee to meet with foreign officials \u2014 but that\u2019s typically done overseas and with leaders below the level of president or prime minister.\u201d It\u2019s easy to see why Trump is taking these meetings: \u201cAs he defends himself against criminal charges in federal and state courts, these foreign officials\u2014most of them far-right politicians\u2014are providing validation for Trump.\u201d\n\nWhat the Polls Show\n\nPew released a poll on Wednesday showing that four-out-of-ten Americans see China an enemy, while five in ten see China a competitor. Perhaps unsurprisingly, self-identified Republican are more likely to see China as an enemy; Democrats are more likely to see China as a competitor. Either way, eight-in-ten Americans view China negatively. Nearly half (49 percent) of Americans say that limiting China should be a top foreign priority goal. The poll did not attempt to determine how much of a cost Americans would be willing to bear to limit China\u2019s rise.\n\nThe Campaign Schedule\n\nThe Republican National Convention opens in Milwaukee in seventy-three days (July 15, 2024).\n\nThe Democratic National Convention opens in Chicago in 108 days (August 19, 2024).\n\nElection Day is 186 days away.\n\nInauguration Day is 262 days away.\n\nSinet Adous assisted in the preparation of this post.",

                "description": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Today the U.S. Department of the Treasury and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) released final rules on the clean vehicle provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) that are lowering costs for consumers, spurring a boom in U.S. manufacturing, and strengthening energy security by building resilient supply chains with allies and partners. Since President Biden was elected, $173 billion in private-sector investment has been announced across the U.S. clean vehicle and battery supply chain.\u00a0\u201cPresident Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act has unleashed an investment and manufacturing boom in the United States.\u00a0I\u2019ve seen firsthand in Tennessee, North Carolina, and Kentucky how ecosystems have developed in communities nationwide to onshore the entire clean vehicle supply chain so the United States can lead in the field of green energy,\u201d said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen.\u00a0\u201cThe Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s clean vehicle credits save consumers up to $7,500 on a new vehicle, and hundreds of dollars per year on gas, while creating good-paying jobs and strengthening our energy security.\u201d\u201cToday\u2019s actions from Treasury and DOE provide clarity and certainty to an EV marketplace that\u2019s rapidly growing,\u201d said John Podesta, Senior Advisor to the President for International Climate Policy. \u201cThe direction we\u2019re headed is clear\u2014toward a future where many more Americans drive an EV or a plug-in hybrid and where those vehicles are affordable and made here in America.\u201d\u00a0\u201cSince his first day in office, President Biden has bet on America, invested in our competitiveness, and stood with U.S. auto workers,\u201d said Assistant to the President and National Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi. \u201cWe are seeing the impact of that leadership. Under President Biden, the U.S. went from laggard to leading the rest of the world in EV manufacturing investment. EV sales have quadrupled. New factories are opening up, including 15 gigafactories commissioned to bring back jobs manufacturing batteries invented here in America. Driven by the President\u2019s vision and leadership, the sector is experiencing a manufacturing boom \u2013 and it\u2019s reaching every corner of the country. These credits for clean vehicles are the latest action by the Biden-Harris Administration to save consumers thousands of dollars and ensure the future of the auto industry is made in America by American workers.\u201dThe final rules being issued today strengthen and secure supply chains and provide certainty for manufacturers and taxpayers. After careful consideration of the extensive public feedback received in response to the proposed rules, the Treasury Department and the IRS are providing definitions and rules regarding taxpayer and vehicle eligibility for the credit for new clean vehicles and the previously-owned clean vehicle credit. The rules also address the critical minerals and battery components requirements and Foreign Entity of Concern (or \u201cexcluded entity\u201d) restriction that were added to the clean vehicle credit by the IRA. Concurrently with today\u2019s final rules, the Department of Energy (DOE) is also releasing final interpretive guidance related to the definition of Foreign Entity of Concern for purposes of the 30D clean vehicle credit and the battery manufacturing grant program created by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.\u00a0Today\u2019s release also includes rules for transferring the 30D clean vehicle credit of up to $7,500 and 25E previously owned clean vehicle credit of up to $4,000 to registered dealers. This mechanism created by the IRA is already extending the reach of the credits by making the credit available at the point of sale rather than when buyers file their taxes. Researchers have found that consumers overwhelmingly prefer an immediate rebate at point of sale. So far this year, more than 100,000 credits have been transferred at the point of sale, representing more than $700 million in upfront savings for consumers.\u00a0These rules provide for robust program integrity measures, including upfront review of compliance with both critical mineral and battery component requirements and the FEOC restrictions starting this summer. The IRS, with analytical assistance from DOE, will conduct upfront review of documentation and certifications addressing materials sourcing requirements to ensure that qualified manufacturers are accurately representing their battery contents. In addition, the final rules confirm that taxpayers may rely on vehicle eligibility information provided by manufacturers so that taxpayers are not penalized for manufacturers mistakes.Calculating $3,750 Critical Minerals Credit\u00a0For determining qualifying critical mineral content for purposes of the critical minerals requirement, today\u2019s release provides a new test, the traced qualifying value add test. Under this test, manufacturers must conduct a\u00a0detailed supply chain tracing to determine the actual value-added percentage for extraction, processing, and recycling. The actual percentage is used to determine the value for the applicable critical mineral that is qualifying. Manufacturers may continue to use the 50 percent roll up described in the proposed regulations as a transition rule until 2027.Foreign Entity of Concern\u00a0For the Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) restriction, the final regulations make permanent the allocation-based accounting rules for applicable critical minerals contained in a battery cell. The final regulations also identify certain impracticable-to-trace battery materials. As tracing standards and capabilities develop, qualified manufacturers may temporarily exclude these battery materials from FEOC due diligence and FEOC compliance determinations until 2027.\u00a0\u00a0To take advantage of the FEOC transition rules for impracticable-to-trace battery materials, qualified manufacturers must submit a report during the upfront review process noted above, demonstrating how the qualified manufacturer will comply with the FEOC restriction once the transition rule is no longer in effect.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Clean Vehicle Credit Requirement20242025Foreign Entity of Concern Restriction for Battery Components\u00a0(to receive any credit)YESYESForeign Entity of Concern Restriction for Critical Minerals\u00a0(to receive any credit)NOYESBattery Component Applicable Percentage (to receive $3,750)60%60%Critical Minerals Applicable Percentage (to receive $3,750)50%60%\u00a0The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to using every tool available to build secure, resilient, trusted supply chains for EVs and EV batteries, and to creating good-paying and union jobs throughout the EV supply chain in the United States. The White House, working with the Department of Treasury and Department of Energy, intends to convene domestic critical minerals producers, battery manufacturers, and automakers in the coming weeks to identify additional opportunities to accelerate growth in this sector in the United States, including through offtake agreements between domestic critical mineral producers and battery and EV manufacturers.###",

They don't want immigrants.\"\n\nThe BBC contacted the US embassies of Japan, India, China and Russia for comment, but did not receive an immediate reply.\n\nThe comments, however, have drawn criticism from US commentators.\n\nOn X, formerly Twitter, Elbridge Colby, a former US deputy assistant secretary of defence in the Trump administration, wrote that Japan and India \"are two of our very stoutest and important allies\".\n\n\"We should speak to them with respect, which they command and deserve,\" he added. \"Applying parochial progressive views to our allies is patronising and foolish.\"\n\nAlthough Japan, India and China have relatively few foreign-born workers, Russia is heavily reliant on migrant labour, much of it drawn from Central Asia.\n\nWhile economic growth has been sluggish in Japan and China, Russia's militarised economy rebounded slightly last year as its war with Ukraine continues, despite international sanctions.\n\nIndia, meanwhile, has experienced steady growth and surpassed the UK in 2023 to become the world's fifth-largest economy.\n\nThe White House denied that Mr Biden's comments were meant in a derogatory sense, with national security spokesman John Kirby saying he was making a wider point on US immigration policy.\n\n\"Our allies and partners know well in tangible ways how President Biden values them, their friendship, their co-operation\" Mr Kirby said. \"They understand how much he completely and utterly values the idea of alliances and partnerships.\"\n\nSadanand Dhume, a South Asia expert at the Washington DC-based American Enterprise Institute, told the BBC that Mr Biden's comments would probably be received poorly in India as it experiences a \"nationalist upsurge\".\n\n\"It will confirm the idea among a section of Indians that Mr Biden is not friendly to India,\" he said. \"They will not take kindly to having been clubbed along with authoritarian countries like China.\"\n\nIn late April, a US Department of State report found \"significant\" human rights abuses in India, which its government said \"is deeply biased and reflects a very poor understanding of India.\"\n\nIn the longer term, however, Mr Dhume said that remarks are a \"tempest in a teacup\" and \"unlikely to significantly affect US-Indian relations.\"\n\nWhile Japan has for decades had some of the world's most restrictive immigration policies, it has recently sought to address a steadily shrinking population by facilitating the entry of foreign workers.",

        "text": "Elizabeth Dole\nAmerican politician and writer (born 1936)\n\nMary Elizabeth Alexander Dole (n\u00e9e Hanford; born July 29, 1936)[1] is an American attorney, author, and politician who served as a United States Senator from North Carolina from 2003 to 2009. A member of the Republican Party, she previously served in five presidential administrations, including as U.S. Secretary of Transportation under President Ronald Reagan from 1983 to 1987 and as U.S. Secretary of Labor under Reagan's successor, George H. W. Bush, from 1989 until 1990. Dole then left government to serve as president of the American Red Cross from 1991 to 1999; she departed from that position to seek the Republican nomination in the 2000 presidential election but eventually withdrew from the race.\n\nDole graduated from Duke University in 1958 and earned a Juris Doctor degree from Harvard Law School in 1965. Throughout her public career, she was the first woman to hold a number of positions, including secretary of transportation, becoming the first woman to serve in two different presidential cabinet positions for two presidents after being appointed secretary of labor, as well as the first female U.S. senator from North Carolina and chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. She was also the third female secretary of labor and just the second woman to lead the American Red Cross since its founder, Clara Barton. She is the widow of U.S. Senator Bob Dole from Kansas, who served as the Republican Senate leader and was the party's presidential nominee in the 1996 election and vice presidential nominee in the 1976 election.\n\nEarly life and education [ edit ]\n\nDole was born Mary Elizabeth Alexander Hanford in Salisbury, North Carolina, to Mary Ella (n\u00e9e Cathey; 1901\u20132004) and John Van Hanford (1893\u20131978).[1][2]\n\nDole attended Duke University and graduated with distinction in political science on June 2, 1958. She was a finalist for an Angier B. Duke scholarship, a full-tuition award given to outstanding applicants who matriculate at Duke.[3] She was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and was a recipient of the Algernon Sydney Sullivan Award, a national prize given to those exemplifying the ideal of service to others.\n\nAmong her activities at Duke were the chapel choir, Chanticleer (yearbook) business staff, freshman advisory council, the Order of the White Duchy (a local honorary society for outstanding women student leaders, a female counterpart of the Order of the Red Friars), Phi Kappa Delta (a local leadership honorary for senior women), and Pi Sigma Alpha (a national political-science honorary society). Dole is a sister of Delta Delta Delta.[4] She was also elected president of the woman's student government association, 1958 May queen, and \"leader of the year\" by the student newspaper, The Chronicle. Dole has remained involved with Duke University, serving at various points in time as president of the Duke University alumnae association, and a member of the board of trustees and board of visitors.[5] She has spoken formally at Duke several times.\n\nFollowing her graduation from Duke, she did her post-graduate work at Oxford in 1959. After Oxford, she took a job as a student teacher at Melrose High School in Melrose, Massachusetts, for the 1959\u20131960 school year.[6] While teaching, she also pursued her master's degree in education from Harvard University, which she earned in 1960, followed by a J.D. from Harvard Law School in 1965.[7] At graduation, she was one of 24 women in a class of 550 students.[8] She is an alumna of the Phi Beta Kappa honor society.\n\nWhite House years [ edit ]\n\nJohnson administration [ edit ]\n\nDole, who had campaigned for the Kennedy\u2013Johnson presidential ticket in 1960,[9] began working in 1967 as a staff assistant to the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare in the Lyndon B. Johnson administration.[10]\n\nNixon and Ford administrations [ edit ]\n\nWhen many Democrats left the White House following Richard Nixon's replacement of Johnson, Dole did not. From 1969 to 1973, she served as deputy assistant to President Nixon for consumer affairs.[11] In 1973, Nixon appointed her to a seven-year term on the Federal Trade Commission.[7]\n\nElizabeth Dole with friend and mentor Virginia Knauer\n\nDole first met her future husband, Bob Dole, in the spring of 1972 at a meeting arranged by her boss and mentor, Virginia Knauer.[12] The couple dated, and she became his second wife on December 6, 1975, in the Washington National Cathedral.[13] They had no children, though she is stepmother to Bob's adult daughter Robin from his first marriage of 24 years, which ended in divorce in 1972. She attended individually, and later with her husband, the Foundry United Methodist Church in Washington, D.C., before joining the National Presbyterian Church in 1996.[13] Articles at the time reported that the Doles stopped attending Foundry in 1995, finding the pastor at the time, J. Philip Wogaman, too liberal.[14]\n\nIn 1975, she became a Republican. She took a leave from her post as a Federal Trade Commissioner for several months in 1976 to campaign for her husband for vice president of the United States, when he ran on the Republican ticket with Gerald Ford.[7] She later resigned from the FTC in 1979, to campaign for her husband's 1980 presidential run. During the 1970s, Dole was a self-described member of the Women's Liberation Movement and helped reform laws to ensure equal credit for women. She was also a supporter of the Equal Rights Amendment to the United States Constitution.[15]\n\nReagan administration and Secretary of Transportation [ edit ]\n\nShe served as director of the White House Office of Public Liaison, from 1981 to 1983 and as United States Secretary of Transportation from 1983 to 1987 under Ronald Reagan. She was also appointed by Reagan to chair task forces that sought to reform federal and state laws to ensure equal rights for women. She was the first woman appointed Secretary of Transportation. In this role, she was the first woman to have served as the head of a branch of the United States military, as the United States Coast Guard was under the Department of Transportation at the time. Dole's appointment was \"particularly irritating\" to conservative activists, since \"though at least nominally opposed to abortion, [she was] viewed by the right as [an] aggressive feminist.\"[16]\n\nThe official Department of Labor portrait of Elizabeth Dole\n\nFirst Lady Nancy Reagan greets Dole and other Senate wives in the Blue Room. 1988\n\nDuring her tenure, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration mandated the installation of a center high-mounted stop lamp on new cars; these are sometimes called \"Liddy Lights\" in her recognition.[17] She worked with MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Driving) to pass laws withholding federal highway funding from any state that had a drinking age below 21. The state government of South Dakota opposed the drinking age law and sued Dole in the case South Dakota v. Dole, but the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Dole. She oversaw the privatization of the national freight railroad, Conrail. She initiated random drug testing within the Department of Transportation. By 1984 Dole had stopped trying to get Reagan to support the Equal Rights Amendment. She was quoted in the press that year saying, \"He's not going to change on that.\"[18]\n\nBush administration and Secretary of Labor [ edit ]\n\nDole served as United States Secretary of Labor from 1989 to 1990 under George H. W. Bush; she is the first woman to serve in two different Cabinet positions in the administrations of two presidents. Her tenure as both U.S. Transportation Secretary and U.S. Labor Secretary focused heavily on improving public safety and workplace safety and health.[citation needed]\n\nAmerican Red Cross presidency [ edit ]\n\nIn 1991, Dole became the president of the American Red Cross.[19] She served until 1999. She was the second woman to serve as president since Clara Barton founded the organization in 1881. She restructured the world's largest humanitarian organization during her eight years as president, serving as a volunteer in her first year. She also led a transformation of the way the Red Cross collects, tests, and distributes one-half of the nation's blood supply.[20]\n\n1996 Republican National Convention [ edit ]\n\nDole's husband Bob Dole was the Republican nominee in the US presidential election of 1996. Elizabeth Dole, who would have become First Lady had her husband won the election, or the Second Lady of the United States, had Gerald Ford won the 1976 election, received recognition for her speech at the 1996 Republican National Convention, during which she walked out into the audience while talking conversationally about her husband's qualities.[citation needed]\n\n2000 United States presidential candidacy [ edit ]\n\nElizabeth Dole ran for the Republican nomination in the 2000 United States presidential election.\n\nSpeculation of a presidential campaign became widespread after Dole announced her departure from her job as president of the Red Cross on January 4, 1999.[21]\n\nDole announced she was forming an exploratory committee on March 10, 1999.[22]\n\nWhile Dole had been an active participant in her husband's campaign four years prior, he was largely absent from the campaign trail during her campaign.[23][24]\n\nIn August, Dole placed third \u2013 behind George W. Bush and Steve Forbes \u2013 in a large field in the Iowa Straw Poll (the first, non-binding, test of electability for the Republican Party nomination). The Iowa Straw Poll differed from the national polls where she was second only to Bush; Senator John McCain was in third place.[citation needed]\n\nDole withdrew from race in October 1999 before any of the primaries, largely due to inadequate fundraising even though a Gallup poll had her in second place in the presidential race at 11% behind George W. Bush at 60% as late as October 1999.[25]\n\n2000 vice presidential vetting [ edit ]\n\nShortly before the 2000 Republican National Convention in Philadelphia, Bush campaign sources said Elizabeth Dole was on the short list to be named the vice-presidential nominee, along with Michigan Governor John Engler, New York Governor George Pataki, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge, and former Missouri Senator John Danforth.[26] Many pundits believed that Dole was the frontrunner for the vice presidential nomination. Bush then surprised most pundits by selecting former U.S. Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, who was actually in charge of leading Bush's search for a vice presidential nominee.[citation needed]\n\nUnited States Senate career [ edit ]\n\n2002 Senate campaign [ edit ]\n\nIn late December 2001, Dole shifted her official residency from the Doles' condominium in the Watergate complex to her mother's home in Salisbury to seek election to the U.S. Senate.[27][28] The seat was made available by the retirement of Republican Jesse Helms. Although Dole had not lived regularly in North Carolina since 1959 and had been a resident of the Washington area for most of the time since the mid-1960s, the state and national Republican establishment quickly cleared the field for her. She handily won the Republican primary with 80 percent of the vote over a lesser-known candidate, Ada Fisher. In the November general election, she defeated her Democratic opponent Erskine Bowles, a former chief of staff to former President Bill Clinton, by an eight-point margin.\n\nHer election to the Senate marked the first time a spouse of a former Senator was elected to the Senate from a different state from that of her spouse. (Although Kansas Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum married former Tennessee Senator Howard Baker, the marriage occurred after Kassebaum and Baker both had finished their service in the Senate.) Dole was criticized by Democrats (including then-North Carolina Senator John Edwards and her challenger, Erskine Bowles) during her first Senate campaign over the fact that for over 40 years prior to her nomination, she had not lived in North Carolina.\n\nIn November 2004, following Republican gains in the United States Senate, Dole narrowly edged out Senator Norm Coleman of Minnesota for the post of chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. She is the first woman to become chair of the NRSC. During her election cycle as chairperson, her Democratic Party counterpart, Senator Chuck Schumer raised significantly more money, and experienced more success in recruiting candidates. In the November election, Dole's party lost six U.S. Senate seats to the Democrats, thus losing control of the U.S. Senate. Dole was replaced as NRSC chair by Senator John Ensign of Nevada following the 2006 midterms.\n\n2008 Senate re-election campaign [ edit ]\n\nDole was initially a heavy favorite for re-election, especially after several potential top-tier challengers such as Congressman Brad Miller, Governor Mike Easley and former Governor Jim Hunt all declined to compete against Dole.[29][30] Ultimately, Kay Hagan, a state senator from Greensboro, won the Democratic primary election against Jim Neal and became Dole's general election opponent. Reports late in the campaign suggested that Dole suffered from Barack Obama's decision to aggressively contest North Carolina in the presidential election,[31] while Hagan received substantial support from independent 527 groups lobbying/advertising against Dole,[30] as well as the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee, which spent more money in North Carolina than in any other state during the 2008 election season.[30] Dole undertook an eight-day \"ElizaBus\" tour of the state in the days leading up to election day.[32]\n\nIn late October, Dole released a controversial television ad attacking Hagan for reportedly taking donations from individuals involved in the Godless Americans PAC, a group that advocates for the rights of people who do not believe in God. The ad also included a female voice saying, \"There is no god.\" Hagan's campaign said the ad sought to put inflammatory words in their candidate's mouth. Hagan, who was a member of the Presbyterian Church and a former Sunday school teacher,[33] condemned the ad as \"fabricated and pathetic,\" and, according to Hagan's campaign website, a cease-and-desist letter was \"hand-delivered to Dole's Raleigh office and to her home at the Watergate in Washington, DC.\"[34] Hagan also filed a lawsuit in Wake County Superior Court accusing Dole of defamation and libel.[35][36] The ad met significant criticism from some members of the public as well as national media outlets. After the first ad Hagan received over 3,600 contributions, including major donors as well as individual support from a range of persons who believed in the right to participate in civil government free of religious orthodoxy requirements. Following the second ad Hagan's lead doubled according to some polls.[37]\n\nIn the 2008 election, Dole lost by a wider-than-expected margin, taking 44 percent of the vote to Hagan's 53 percent. It has been speculated that the outcry over the \"Godless\" ad contributed to Dole's loss.[38] Hagan trounced Dole in the state's five largest counties \u2013 Mecklenburg, Wake, Guilford, Forsyth and Durham. Hagan also dominated most of the eastern portion of the state, which had been the backbone of Helms' past Senate victories. While Dole dominated the Charlotte suburbs and most of the heavily Republican Foothills region, it was not enough to save her seat.\n\nPolitical positions [ edit ]\n\nDole's voting record was somewhat more conservative than that of her husband, though slightly less conservative than that of Helms. She has a lifetime rating of 92 from the American Conservative Union.[citation needed]\n\nDole worked with other senators such as Chuck Hagel to draft and attempt to pass legislation reforming housing financing regulation; the bill did not go up for a vote.[39]\n\nIn September 2008, Dole joined the Gang of 20, a bipartisan group working towards comprehensive energy reform, which pushed for a bill that would encourage state-by-state decisions on offshore drilling and authorize billions of dollars for conservation and alternative energy.[40]\n\nAs a member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services, Dole is credited with helping to prevent any closures of North Carolina military bases despite threats from the Department of Defense.[41] In 2007, she sponsored legislation which would have granted federal recognition of a North Carolina Native American tribe, the Lumbee based in Robeson County.[42]\n\nCommittee assignments [ edit ]\n\nDole was a member of the following U.S. Senate committees:\n\nAfter politics: Elizabeth Dole Foundation [ edit ]\n\nDole with Nancy Pelosi and John McCain at a 2014 meeting of the congressional \"Hidden Heroes Caucus\"\n\nIn 2012, Dole established the Elizabeth Dole Foundation,[43] dedicated to helping caregivers of \"wounded warriors\".[44]\n\nDole commissioned the RAND Corporation to develop the first nationwide comprehensive, evidence-based report on the needs of military and veteran caregivers.[45] The two-year study includes an environmental scan of available services, a gap analysis, and recommendations for meeting the enormous challenges of America's hidden helpers \u2013 the young spouses, mothers, fathers and other loved ones caring for those who cared for us. The study was generously supported by the Wounded Warrior Project, the Lilly Endowment, and the Cannon Foundation.[46]\n\nThe foundation selects military and veteran caregivers from each state to serve a two-year Fellowship with the foundation. The Dole Fellows represent a vast array of military caregivers: spouses, parents, siblings and friends, and use their voice to help bring awareness on a national scale.[47] The foundation also has a National Coalition Program to bring together private and public entities to create substantial change.[48] in 2022 the foundation selected and began working with the civil rights icon and veteran Bobby Grier.[49][50]\n\nActor Tom Hanks joined the foundation's Hidden Heroes Campaign to bring awareness to the over 5.5 million military caregivers across America who are facing enormous challenges every day caring for members of the military and gravely injured veterans.[51]\n\nBooks [ edit ]\n\nAuthor [ edit ]\n\nSubject [ edit ]\n\nLucas, Eileen (1998) Elizabeth Dole: A Leader In Washington.

The 64-year-old lawyer from the Realizando Metas (Achieving Goals) party was Mr Martinelli's running mate.\n\nBut after Mr Martinelli was sentenced to almost 11 years in prison for money laundering, Mr Mulino joined the race for president.\n\nHowever, Mr Mulino's candidacy has also faced legal challenges.\n\nPanama's top court was asked to decide whether the fact that Mr Mulino was not chosen by his party in the customary primary election invalidated his candidacy.\n\nOn Friday, just two days before the election, the court finally ruled that his candidacy was constitutional.\n\nMr Mulino has the backing of his former running mate, Ricardo Martinelli, who has been living in the Nicaraguan embassy in Panama City since February, where he was granted political asylum.\n\nFrom a small room in the embassy, Martinelli has been publishing video messages in support of Mr Mulino, who served as his interior and security minister.\n\nGetty Images Mr Martinelli has been living in the Nicaraguan embassy since February\n\nMr Mulino has said that if elected, he will \"close down\" the Dari\u00e9n Gap, the dangerous stretch of jungle on Panama's border with Colombia which hundreds of thousands of migrants cross every year on their journey north to the United States.\n\nHe has not said how he would close the dangerous route but has made stopping migration an important part of his \"law and order\" proposals.\n\nA number of recent opinion polls have put Mr Mulino in the lead but with around a fifth of registered voters saying they had not yet decided to vote for, his rivals are still very much in with a chance.\n\nTwo of those hoping to beat Mr Mulino also are very well-known names in Panamanian politics.\n\nMart\u00edn Torrijos was president from 2004 to 2009 and is the son of Omar Torrijos, the military ruler who signed a treaty with the US to restore the Panama Canal zone to Panamanian sovereignty in 1977.\n\nThe 60-year-old is campaigning under the slogan \"Safe Change\". He has promised investment in the Panama Canal, one of the main drivers of Panama's economy.\n\nEPA Mart\u00edn Torrijos has been president before and his campaigning simply under his first name\n\nHe is standing for the People's Party, which he joined last year after leading the Revolutionary Democratic Party (PRD).\n\nR\u00f3mulo Roux, 59, a former president of the Panama Canal's board of directors is running for the national presidency for the second time, after losing to current President Laurentino Cortizo in 2019.\n\nThe lawyer, who is standing for the Democratic Change party says that if he is elected, he will implement an \"aggressive\" job creation scheme and improve public services.\n\nReuters R\u00f3mulo Roux is one of those campaigning in Panama City\n\nHe has also said that he would not back the reopening of a controversial copper mine, even though he worked for the law firm which represented the mine.\n\nThe closure of the mine was announced last year after mass protests shook the country.\n\nAnother candidate who is trying to reach the presidency for a second time is Ricardo Lombana.\n\nReuters Ricardo Lombana is having a second go at running for the presidency\n\nThe 49-year-old lawyer ran as an independent in 2019 and is standing for the Other Way Movement this time.\n\nMr Lombana has dismissed Mr Mulino's promise to \"close\" the Dari\u00e9n Gap, telling Spanish news agency Efe that \"migration, ever since humankind exists, is not stopped by walls\".\n\nHe instead is proposing to improve security conditions for the migrants who cross Panama on their way north.\n\nThe other four candidates, who have been lagging behind the top four in the most resent opinion polls, are Jos\u00e9 Gabriel Carrizo, Zulay Rodr\u00edguez, Melit\u00f3n Arrocha and Maribel Gord\u00f3n.",

We welcome speakers and scholars who represent a broad range of perspectives and ideas, certain that we are sharpened when we engage with the broadest spectrum of thought.\n\nPlease note the views presented in the Election Year Speaker Series are solely those of the speakers and do not represent official views held by Whitworth University.\n\nWhitworth Faculty Presentations\n\nRegistration is not required.\n\nPatricia Bruininks & Megan Hershey | Hope & Democracy Discussion\n\nOct. 2, 4 p.m., Dixon Hall 206, Whitworth University\n\nWhitworth Professor of Psychology Patricia Bruininks and Professor of Political Science Megan Hershey will present their recent research on the intersection of hope and democracy, considering what factors influence one's hope for a democratic future and how this hope might shape political engagement. Q&A to follow.\n\nAaron Hitefield | Exploring the 2024 Presidential Election\n\nOct. 16, 6:30 p.m., Cowles Music Center Recital Hall, Whitworth University\n\nWhitworth Assistant Professor of Political Science Aaron Hitefield will provide an overview of the upcoming presidential and congressional elections, highlighting what to look out for and what we might expect in the 2024 elections.\n\nPrevious Election Year Speaker Series Events\n\nMiranda Zapor Cruz | Faith-Filled Political Engagement: Christian Convictions in the Public Square\n\nPresented in partnership with Whitworth's Speakers & Artists program.\n\nWhat is the right relationship between Christian faith and American politics? Should Christians keep our convictions separate from our policy positions? Or is it our job as Christians to use representative government to enact faith-based legislation? These questions ought to challenge us and draw us into tension. Whitworth alumna Miranda Zapor Cruz '05, Ph.D., professor of historical theology at Indiana Wesleyan University, will explore faithful approaches to Christian political engagement, drawn from Christian history and theology. This nonpartisan talk will equip Christians to follow Jesus faithfully into the political sphere.\n\nClick here to view a recording of this presentation.\n\nMatthew Kaemingk | Polarization and the (Im)Possibility of Christian Hospitality\n\nIt often feels like America is being torn apart by its deep political, religious and cultural differences. Matthew Kaemingk, Ph.D., is a political ethicist and public theologian from Fuller Theological Seminary. He is also a proud Whitworth alum. In this lecture, Kaemingk offers a surprising claim: America's deep differences are not, in fact, a problem that needs to be solved. The true issue is how Americans choose to navigate those deep differences. Kaemingk explores the rich theological resources available to both conservative and progressive Christians for how they might navigate America's deep political, cultural and religious differences.\n\nClick here to view a recording of this presentation.\n\nDavid French | Politics, Christianity & Moral Formation: Finding a Path to Restoration\n\nHow can America, a country with deep moral, cultural and religious differences, navigate this time of polarization and chart a course toward restoration? David French \u2013 author, opinion columnist and former U.S. Army and constitutional law attorney \u2013 will join Whitworth President Scott McQuilkin in a conversation addressing this question. Together, they will explore some of the various elements it takes to engage with people who have opposing viewpoints and to live and work side by side, preserving and strengthening our country. French's most recent book, Divided We Fall: America's Secession Threat and How to Restore Our Nation, was published in 2020.\n\nAnne Snyder | Social Architecture: Creating a Scaffold of Social Life for the Common Good\n\nPresented in partnership with Northwest Passages Book Club and Community Forum.\n\nAnne Snyder is the editor-in-chief of Comment magazine, which looks at contributors to \"social architecture,\" the institutions \"that serve as the scaffolding and skeleton of social life \u2013 our families and financial systems, politics and education, museums and labor unions, and more.\" Her book, The Fabric of Character: A Wise Giver's Guide to Renewing our Social and Moral Landscape, was published in 2019. Snyder also hosts The Whole Person Revolution podcast.\n\nAlexandra Hudson | The Soul of Civility: Toward Meaningful Engagement & Change\n\nPresented in partnership with Whitworth's Speakers & Artists program.\n\nAre you interested in finding ways to talk about important topics with others, even in a time of polarization? You're not alone. We face this challenge today and have faced it throughout human history. Fortunately, history also offers us a solution. Erica Salkin, Whitworth professor and interim dean of the Colleges of Arts & Sciences, will interview author Alexandra Hudson about civil discourse \u2013 both what it is and what it is not (spoiler alert: it's different from being polite). Hudson will share examples you can apply to help yourself, your family, your community and our country thrive. Hudson's recent book, The Soul of Civility: Timeless Principles to Heal Society and Ourselves, was published in 2023.\n\nClick here to view a recording of this presentation.",

        "text": "Falklands dispute may last decades - Argentina president\nFalklands dispute may last decades - Argentina president\n\nBBC\n\nArgentina\u2019s president Javier Milei says he accepts the Falkland Islands are currently \u201cin the hands of the UK\". In an interview with the BBC, the right-wing politician vowed to get the islands back through diplomatic channels but said there was \u201cno instant solution\u201d. His language on the status of the Falklands is different from past leaders who have historically maintained the islands are Argentine. President Milei admitted it could take decades to try to gain sovereignty of the Falkland Islands from the UK and said Argentina does not \"seek conflict\".\n\nIt comes after he promised a \u201croadmap\u201d for the islands to become Argentine, on the 42nd anniversary of the Falklands War in early April. He had criticised politicians who \u201cbeat their chests demanding sovereignty of the islands, but without any result\u201d. The UK and Argentina went to war over the British overseas territory - known as the Malvinas in Argentina - in 1982. The invasion claimed the lives of 255 British servicemen, three islanders and 649 Argentinian personnel. But President Milei praised Margaret Thatcher who was the UK prime minister during the Falklands War. He was speaking in his presidential palace office, in which there was some Margaret Thatcher memorabilia on a display table. Elsewhere, sat a photograph of a former Argentine president with the Rolling Stones, a bust sculpture of himself, and a water bottle with his photograph on it. Lady Thatcher ordered the torpedoing of the Argentine naval cruiser the General Belgrano during the war, resulting in the deaths of 323 people on board. Asked if he still admired her, President Milei said: \u201cCriticising someone because of their nationality or race is very intellectually precarious. I have heard lots of speeches by Margaret Thatcher. She was brilliant. So what's the problem?\u201d\n\nJavier Milei was interviewed by Ione Wells in the presidential palace",

        "text": "Geographic and Temporal Trends in Fake News Consumption During the 2016 US Presidential Election\nAbstract\n\nWe present an analysis of traffic to websites known for publishing fake news in the months preceding the 2016 US presidential election. The study is based on the combined instrumentation data from two popular desktop web browsers: Internet Explorer 11 and Edge. We find that social media was the primary outlet for the circulation of fake news stories and that aggregate voting patterns were strongly correlated with the average daily fraction of users visiting websites serving fake news. This correlation was observed both at the state level and at the county level, and remained stable throughout the main election season. We propose a simple model based on homophily in social networks to explain the linear association. Finally, we highlight examples of different types of fake news stories: while certain stories continue to circulate in the population, others are short-lived and die out in a few days.",

        "text": "Chad presidential election: Vote set to end military rule\nChad presidential vote set to end military rule\n\nPrime Minister Succ\u00e8s Masra is among his nine challengers and is seen as his biggest rival.\n\nBut as his son, and successor, Gen Mahamat D\u00e9by is one of the favourites to win, there is some scepticism about whether this will bring about change.\n\nIt will end a three-year transition imposed after the sudden death of long-serving leader Idriss D\u00e9by Itno while fighting rebels.\n\nChad is set to become the first of Africa's current junta-led states to move to democratic rule with Monday's presidential vote.\n\nThe voting has been mostly peaceful but one 65-year-old man was shot dead after voting in the southern city of Moundou, according to officials quoted by the AFP news agency.\n\nThey said the unknown gunman had opened fire after being barred from voting because he didn't have an electoral card and had stormed a polling station, along with others, shooting indiscriminately.\n\nThe local mayor said four people were arrested.\n\nThere have also been some opposition reports of irregularities.\n\nAs he cast his vote in the capital, N\u2019Djamena, President D\u00e9by said he was proud to have fulfilled his promise to respect the deadline for \u201celections that will signal a return to constitutional order.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s up to the Chadian people to vote massively and choose their president,\u201d he added.\n\nMr Masra wore a blue boubou, or traditional gown, as he voted, reports the AFP news agency.\n\n\"All those who have shown they want massive change must go and vote in massive numbers, peacefully,\" he said after voting.\n\nLaoukoura Sa-Ndoudjinang, 72, has little faith that the election will lead to any change but still went to vote.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have free and credible elections in Chad because we can\u2019t imagine that an electoral code would prevent representatives of political parties from having the result tally. It doesn't make sense. If there's a crisis tomorrow, I wouldn't be surprised,\" he told the BBC.\n\n\"My wish is for there to be free and transparent elections, so that the voice of the people would count. Governing a country with weapons isn't normal.\"\n\nBut Ibrahim Moussa Youssouf was more hopeful.\n\n\"The votes are being conducted under very good conditions, because there was great sensitization... The outcome would be such that Chad will change.\"\n\nTen politicians who had been hoping to run, including two prominent figures, Nassour Ibrahim Neguy Koursami and Rakhis Ahmat Saleh, were excluded by the constitutional council because of \u201cirregularities\u201d. For example, Mr Koursami was accused of forgery.\n\nBut some have argued that the decision to bar certain people was politically motivated.\n\nAnother potential opponent, Yaya Dillo, was killed by security forces in February while allegedly leading an attack on the National Security Agency in the capital, N\u2019Djamena.\n\nActivists have called for a boycott of the election that they termed a ploy to lend a sheen of democratic legitimacy to the D\u00e9by dynasty.\n\nMany are still in exile following a deadly crackdown on opponents following protests in October 2022.\n\nNevertheless, Chad\u2019s election is a milestone for countries in West and Central Africa that have fallen under military rule since a spate of coups began in 2020.\n\nIt may serve as a template for juntas seeking to maintain political influence after first coming to power illegitimately.\n\nThe oil-exporting country of nearly 18 million people has not had a free-and-fair transfer of power since independence from France in 1960.\n\nIdriss D\u00e9by overthrew Hiss\u00e8ne Habr\u00e9 in 1990 and remained in charge for the following three decades until his battlefield death in April 2021 at the age of 68.\n\nHis son, now 40, took over in what opponents described as a constitutional coup and initially pledged to stay on as interim leader for just 18 months, a period that was later extended. He also said that he would not run for president.\n\nGen D\u00e9by has tried to dismiss concerns that he is part of a dynasty.\n\n\u201cIf I am elected, I will serve my five-year term and at the end of my term, it will be up to the people to judge me. As for a dynasty, our constitution is very clear \u2013 a candidate cannot serve more than two successive terms, \u201c he told the France 24 TV channel.",

The measure being put before Everett voters, titled \u201cProposition 1: Levy Lid Lift for Public Safety and Essential Public Services,\u201d asks for a moderate property tax increase, less than $30 per month for the average homeowner, to fund public safety and essential services.\u00a0\u201cThis ballot measure is critical for sustaining our quality of life here in Everett \u2013 providing much needed funding for our essential public services including police and fire; support for those struggling within our community; and our beloved parks, libraries, animal shelter and neighborhood associations,\u201d said Everett Mayor Cassie Franklin. \u201cThese services and programs are important elements of what makes our city a great place to live, work and play here and I appreciate our council members for moving this measure forward.\u201dProposition 1 would increase Everett\u2019s property levy rate to $2.19/ $1,000 of assessed value, which amounts to an overall increase of about $28 per month for a $500,000 home (based on assessed value). If passed, this measure would help fund public safety, park maintenance, libraries, the animal shelter, street maintenance, support for neighborhood associations, social services for those in need, the arts, community events; and more.\u00a0This also includes exploring the return of some pandemic era service cuts. A priority will be placed on public safety, including police and fire services, as well as options to re-open the Forest Park Pool through a public private partnership, add a full-time staff position to the Office of the Neighborhoods, and expand library hours.\u201cI\u2019m very proud that Everett is a full-service city \u2013 providing a variety of important services and quality of life amenities for our residents, businesses and visitors,\u201d said Council President Don Schwab. \u201cThis increase will help sustain our service levels and prioritize public safety as well as allow us to look into options to bring back some programs we previously cut.\u201d\u201cAfter months of analysis, community input and multiple Council discussions, I\u2019m glad to see this choice going to our voters. This measure will help ensure adequate funds for our programs and services and get the City on a path toward a more stable financial future,\u201d said Council Vice President Ben Zarlingo.\u201cEnsuring Everett\u2019s vitality means investing in our foundational stability,\u201d said Councilmember Paula Rhyne. \u201cThis request to voters is a responsible step towards investing in the essential services our city residents rely on and expect from a municipal government and a commitment to our residents' safety and well-being.\u201d\u00a0Background on Everett\u2019s budget challengesThe City of Everett is pursuing a property tax increase to help address its ongoing budget deficit. For over 20 years, the City of Everett has faced a structural deficit, primarily caused by the 1% cap on property tax increases. Inflation, changing community needs and increased demand for services cause service costs to rise annually - by more than 1%. This creates a budget deficit. Everett\u2019s deficit is projected to be $12.6 million next year \u2013 and it could grow to over $35 million.\u00a0Everett is not alone in these challenges; cities throughout the state have and are facing similar budget issues, leading to over 60 other Washington cities pursuing property tax levy increases since 2011.Over the years, many efforts have been made to close the budget gap. Since 2018, nearly all recreation programs, lifeguards at Silver Lake, the swim center, the petting zoo and the Bookmobile have been eliminated. The City has found private partners to take on programs like the Carl Gipson Center and the Jetty Island Days program and has worked to become more efficient and streamline processes. To bring in additional revenue, the City has pursued grants and other outside funding, increased or added fees or taxes and encouraged economic development.\u00a0Since January, the Finance team has provided briefings to the Council on the City\u2019s financial position, the structural deficit and revenue options that could help address the issues. While regionalization of some services was discussed, the only option that could be implemented by 2025 would be a levy lid lift.\u00a0Next stepsThe ballot measure and related materials were transmitted to the Snohomish County Auditor\u2019s Office on Friday, May 3, 2024. This measure will appear on Everett residents\u2019 August 6, 2024 ballot.\u00a0If the property tax ballot measure if approved, it would go into effect on January 1, 2025 and would only increase the City of Everett\u2019s portion of property tax.\u00a0Rejection of the levy would mean further cuts to quality of life and essential services provided or supported by the City of Everett. For 2025, the City would need to find $12.6 million in cuts to balance its budget.Learn moreTo learn more about City of Everett Proposition 1: Levy Lid Lift for Public Safety and Essential Public Services, please visit: everettwa.gov/prop1.\u00a0To register to vote, update your registration, learn how to vote or for other questions related to voting or elections, please visit the Snohomish County Elections and Voter Registration webpage: snoco.org/elections. \u00a0###\nEVERETT, Wash. \u2013 At the Wednesday, May 1, 2024 meeting, the Everett City Council passed a resolution in support of adding a property tax levy lid lift ballot measure to the August 6, 2024 primary election.

10, 2024Everett City Council approves resolution for property tax ballot measure for August election EVERETT, Wash. \u2013 At the Wednesday, May 1, 2024 meeting, the Everett City Council passed a resolution in support of adding a property tax levy lid lift ballot measure to the August 6, 2024 primary election. The measure being put before Everett voters, titled \u201cProposition 1: Levy Lid Lift for Public Safety and Essential Public Services,\u201d asks for a moderate property tax increase, less than $30 per month for the average homeowner, to fund public safety and essential services.\u00a0\u201cThis ballot measure is critical for sustaining our quality of life here in Everett \u2013 providing much needed funding for our essential public services including police and fire; support for those struggling within our community; and our beloved parks, libraries, animal shelter and neighborhood associations,\u201d said Everett Mayor Cassie Franklin. \u201cThese services and programs are important elements of what makes our city a great place to live, work and play here and I appreciate our council members for moving this measure forward.\u201dProposition 1 would increase Everett\u2019s property levy rate to $2.19/ $1,000 of assessed value, which amounts to an overall increase of about $28 per month for a $500,000 home (based on assessed value). If passed, this measure would help fund public safety, park maintenance, libraries, the animal shelter, street maintenance, support for neighborhood associations, social services for those in need, the arts, community events; and more.\u00a0This also includes exploring the return of some pandemic era service cuts. A priority will be placed on public safety, including police and fire services, as well as options to re-open the Forest Park Pool through a public private partnership, add a full-time staff position to the Office of the Neighborhoods, and expand library hours.\u201cI\u2019m very proud that Everett is a full-service city \u2013 providing a variety of important services and quality of life amenities for our residents, businesses and visitors,\u201d said Council President Don Schwab. \u201cThis increase will help sustain our service levels and prioritize public safety as well as allow us to look into options to bring back some programs we previously cut.\u201d\u201cAfter months of analysis, community input and multiple Council discussions, I\u2019m glad to see this choice going to our voters. This measure will help ensure adequate funds for our programs and services and get the City on a path toward a more stable financial future,\u201d said Council Vice President Ben Zarlingo.\u201cEnsuring Everett\u2019s vitality means investing in our foundational stability,\u201d said Councilmember Paula Rhyne. \u201cThis request to voters is a responsible step towards investing in the essential services our city residents rely on and expect from a municipal government and a commitment to our residents' safety and well-being.\u201d\u00a0Background on Everett\u2019s budget challengesThe City of Everett is pursuing a property tax increase to help address its ongoing budget deficit. For over 20 years, the City of Everett has faced a structural deficit, primarily caused by the 1% cap on property tax increases. Inflation, changing community needs and increased demand for services cause service costs to rise annually - by more than 1%. This creates a budget deficit. Everett\u2019s deficit is projected to be $12.6 million next year \u2013 and it could grow to over $35 million.\u00a0Everett is not alone in these challenges; cities throughout the state have and are facing similar budget issues, leading to over 60 other Washington cities pursuing property tax levy increases since 2011.Over the years, many efforts have been made to close the budget gap. Since 2018, nearly all recreation programs, lifeguards at Silver Lake, the swim center, the petting zoo and the Bookmobile have been eliminated. The City has found private partners to take on programs like the Carl Gipson Center and the Jetty Island Days program and has worked to become more efficient and streamline processes. To bring in additional revenue, the City has pursued grants and other outside funding, increased or added fees or taxes and encouraged economic development.\u00a0Since January, the Finance team has provided briefings to the Council on the City\u2019s financial position, the structural deficit and revenue options that could help address the issues. While regionalization of some services was discussed, the only option that could be implemented by 2025 would be a levy lid lift.\u00a0Next stepsThe ballot measure and related materials were transmitted to the Snohomish County Auditor\u2019s Office on Friday, May 3, 2024. This measure will appear on Everett residents\u2019 August 6, 2024 ballot.\u00a0If the property tax ballot measure if approved, it would go into effect on January 1, 2025 and would only increase the City of Everett\u2019s portion of property tax.\u00a0Rejection of the levy would mean further cuts to quality of life and essential services provided or supported by the City of Everett. For 2025, the City would need to find $12.6 million in cuts to balance its budget.Learn moreTo learn more about City of Everett Proposition 1: Levy Lid Lift for Public Safety and Essential Public

News\t\t\nPosted on: May 6, 2024 | Last Modified on: July 10, 2024Everett City Council approves resolution for property tax ballot measure for August election EVERETT, Wash. \u2013 At the Wednesday, May 1, 2024 meeting, the Everett City Council passed a resolution in support of adding a property tax levy lid lift ballot measure to the August 6, 2024 primary election. The measure being put before Everett voters, titled \u201cProposition 1: Levy Lid Lift for Public Safety and Essential Public Services,\u201d asks for a moderate property tax increase, less than $30 per month for the average homeowner, to fund public safety and essential services.\u00a0\u201cThis ballot measure is critical for sustaining our quality of life here in Everett \u2013 providing much needed funding for our essential public services including police and fire; support for those struggling within our community; and our beloved parks, libraries, animal shelter and neighborhood associations,\u201d said Everett Mayor Cassie Franklin. \u201cThese services and programs are important elements of what makes our city a great place to live, work and play here and I appreciate our council members for moving this measure forward.\u201dProposition 1 would increase Everett\u2019s property levy rate to $2.19/ $1,000 of assessed value, which amounts to an overall increase of about $28 per month for a $500,000 home (based on assessed value). If passed, this measure would help fund public safety, park maintenance, libraries, the animal shelter, street maintenance, support for neighborhood associations, social services for those in need, the arts, community events; and more.\u00a0This also includes exploring the return of some pandemic era service cuts. A priority will be placed on public safety, including police and fire services, as well as options to re-open the Forest Park Pool through a public private partnership, add a full-time staff position to the Office of the Neighborhoods, and expand library hours.\u201cI\u2019m very proud that Everett is a full-service city \u2013 providing a variety of important services and quality of life amenities for our residents, businesses and visitors,\u201d said Council President Don Schwab. \u201cThis increase will help sustain our service levels and prioritize public safety as well as allow us to look into options to bring back some programs we previously cut.\u201d\u201cAfter months of analysis, community input and multiple Council discussions, I\u2019m glad to see this choice going to our voters. This measure will help ensure adequate funds for our programs and services and get the City on a path toward a more stable financial future,\u201d said Council Vice President Ben Zarlingo.\u201cEnsuring Everett\u2019s vitality means investing in our foundational stability,\u201d said Councilmember Paula Rhyne. \u201cThis request to voters is a responsible step towards investing in the essential services our city residents rely on and expect from a municipal government and a commitment to our residents' safety and well-being.\u201d\u00a0Background on Everett\u2019s budget challengesThe City of Everett is pursuing a property tax increase to help address its ongoing budget deficit. For over 20 years, the City of Everett has faced a structural deficit, primarily caused by the 1% cap on property tax increases. Inflation, changing community needs and increased demand for services cause service costs to rise annually - by more than 1%. This creates a budget deficit. Everett\u2019s deficit is projected to be $12.6 million next year \u2013 and it could grow to over $35 million.\u00a0Everett is not alone in these challenges; cities throughout the state have and are facing similar budget issues, leading to over 60 other Washington cities pursuing property tax levy increases since 2011.Over the years, many efforts have been made to close the budget gap. Since 2018, nearly all recreation programs, lifeguards at Silver Lake, the swim center, the petting zoo and the Bookmobile have been eliminated. The City has found private partners to take on programs like the Carl Gipson Center and the Jetty Island Days program and has worked to become more efficient and streamline processes. To bring in additional revenue, the City has pursued grants and other outside funding, increased or added fees or taxes and encouraged economic development.\u00a0Since January, the Finance team has provided briefings to the Council on the City\u2019s financial position, the structural deficit and revenue options that could help address the issues. While regionalization of some services was discussed, the only option that could be implemented by 2025 would be a levy lid lift.\u00a0Next stepsThe ballot measure and related materials were transmitted to the Snohomish County Auditor\u2019s Office on Friday, May 3, 2024. This measure will appear on Everett residents\u2019 August 6, 2024 ballot.\u00a0If the property tax ballot measure if approved, it would go into effect on January 1, 2025 and would only increase the City of Everett\u2019s portion of property tax.\u00a0Rejection of the levy would mean further cuts to quality of life and essential services provided or supported by the City of Everett. For 2025, the City would need to find $12.6 million in cuts to balance its budget.Learn moreTo learn more about City of Everett Proposition 1: Levy Lid Lift for Public Safety and Essential Public

News\t\t\nPosted on: May 6, 2024 | Last Modified on: July 10, 2024Everett City Council approves resolution for property tax ballot measure for August election EVERETT, Wash. \u2013 At the Wednesday, May 1, 2024 meeting, the Everett City Council passed a resolution in support of adding a property tax levy lid lift ballot measure to the August 6, 2024 primary election. The measure being put before Everett voters, titled \u201cProposition 1: Levy Lid Lift for Public Safety and Essential Public Services,\u201d asks for a moderate property tax increase, less than $30 per month for the average homeowner, to fund public safety and essential services.\u00a0\u201cThis ballot measure is critical for sustaining our quality of life here in Everett \u2013 providing much needed funding for our essential public services including police and fire; support for those struggling within our community; and our beloved parks, libraries, animal shelter and neighborhood associations,\u201d said Everett Mayor Cassie Franklin. \u201cThese services and programs are important elements of what makes our city a great place to live, work and play here and I appreciate our council members for moving this measure forward.\u201dProposition 1 would increase Everett\u2019s property levy rate to $2.19/ $1,000 of assessed value, which amounts to an overall increase of about $28 per month for a $500,000 home (based on assessed value). If passed, this measure would help fund public safety, park maintenance, libraries, the animal shelter, street maintenance, support for neighborhood associations, social services for those in need, the arts, community events; and more.\u00a0This also includes exploring the return of some pandemic era service cuts. A priority will be placed on public safety, including police and fire services, as well as options to re-open the Forest Park Pool through a public private partnership, add a full-time staff position to the Office of the Neighborhoods, and expand library hours.\u201cI\u2019m very proud that Everett is a full-service city \u2013 providing a variety of important services and quality of life amenities for our residents, businesses and visitors,\u201d said Council President Don Schwab. \u201cThis increase will help sustain our service levels and prioritize public safety as well as allow us to look into options to bring back some programs we previously cut.\u201d\u201cAfter months of analysis, community input and multiple Council discussions, I\u2019m glad to see this choice going to our voters. This measure will help ensure adequate funds for our programs and services and get the City on a path toward a more stable financial future,\u201d said Council Vice President Ben Zarlingo.\u201cEnsuring Everett\u2019s vitality means investing in our foundational stability,\u201d said Councilmember Paula Rhyne. \u201cThis request to voters is a responsible step towards investing in the essential services our city residents rely on and expect from a municipal government and a commitment to our residents' safety and well-being.\u201d\u00a0Background on Everett\u2019s budget challengesThe City of Everett is pursuing a property tax increase to help address its ongoing budget deficit. For over 20 years, the City of Everett has faced a structural deficit, primarily caused by the 1% cap on property tax increases. Inflation, changing community needs and increased demand for services cause service costs to rise annually - by more than 1%. This creates a budget deficit. Everett\u2019s deficit is projected to be $12.6 million next year \u2013 and it could grow to over $35 million.\u00a0Everett is not alone in these challenges; cities throughout the state have and are facing similar budget issues, leading to over 60 other Washington cities pursuing property tax levy increases since 2011.Over the years, many efforts have been made to close the budget gap. Since 2018, nearly all recreation programs, lifeguards at Silver Lake, the swim center, the petting zoo and the Bookmobile have been eliminated. The City has found private partners to take on programs like the Carl Gipson Center and the Jetty Island Days program and has worked to become more efficient and streamline processes. To bring in additional revenue, the City has pursued grants and other outside funding, increased or added fees or taxes and encouraged economic development.\u00a0Since January, the Finance team has provided briefings to the Council on the City\u2019s financial position, the structural deficit and revenue options that could help address the issues. While regionalization of some services was discussed, the only option that could be implemented by 2025 would be a levy lid lift.\u00a0Next stepsThe ballot measure and related materials were transmitted to the Snohomish County Auditor\u2019s Office on Friday, May 3, 2024. This measure will appear on Everett residents\u2019 August 6, 2024 ballot.\u00a0If the property tax ballot measure if approved, it would go into effect on January 1, 2025 and would only increase the City of Everett\u2019s portion of property tax.\u00a0Rejection of the levy would mean further cuts to quality of life and essential services provided or supported by the City of Everett. For 2025, the City would need to find $12.6 million in cuts to balance its budget.Learn moreTo learn more about City of Everett Proposition 1: Levy Lid Lift for Public Safety and Essential Public

10, 2024Everett City Council approves resolution for property tax ballot measure for August election EVERETT, Wash. \u2013 At the Wednesday, May 1, 2024 meeting, the Everett City Council passed a resolution in support of adding a property tax levy lid lift ballot measure to the August 6, 2024 primary election. The measure being put before Everett voters, titled \u201cProposition 1: Levy Lid Lift for Public Safety and Essential Public Services,\u201d asks for a moderate property tax increase, less than $30 per month for the average homeowner, to fund public safety and essential services.\u00a0\u201cThis ballot measure is critical for sustaining our quality of life here in Everett \u2013 providing much needed funding for our essential public services including police and fire; support for those struggling within our community; and our beloved parks, libraries, animal shelter and neighborhood associations,\u201d said Everett Mayor Cassie Franklin. \u201cThese services and programs are important elements of what makes our city a great place to live, work and play here and I appreciate our council members for moving this measure forward.\u201dProposition 1 would increase Everett\u2019s property levy rate to $2.19/ $1,000 of assessed value, which amounts to an overall increase of about $28 per month for a $500,000 home (based on assessed value). If passed, this measure would help fund public safety, park maintenance, libraries, the animal shelter, street maintenance, support for neighborhood associations, social services for those in need, the arts, community events; and more.\u00a0This also includes exploring the return of some pandemic era service cuts. A priority will be placed on public safety, including police and fire services, as well as options to re-open the Forest Park Pool through a public private partnership, add a full-time staff position to the Office of the Neighborhoods, and expand library hours.\u201cI\u2019m very proud that Everett is a full-service city \u2013 providing a variety of important services and quality of life amenities for our residents, businesses and visitors,\u201d said Council President Don Schwab. \u201cThis increase will help sustain our service levels and prioritize public safety as well as allow us to look into options to bring back some programs we previously cut.\u201d\u201cAfter months of analysis, community input and multiple Council discussions, I\u2019m glad to see this choice going to our voters. This measure will help ensure adequate funds for our programs and services and get the City on a path toward a more stable financial future,\u201d said Council Vice President Ben Zarlingo.\u201cEnsuring Everett\u2019s vitality means investing in our foundational stability,\u201d said Councilmember Paula Rhyne. \u201cThis request to voters is a responsible step towards investing in the essential services our city residents rely on and expect from a municipal government and a commitment to our residents' safety and well-being.\u201d\u00a0Background on Everett\u2019s budget challengesThe City of Everett is pursuing a property tax increase to help address its ongoing budget deficit. For over 20 years, the City of Everett has faced a structural deficit, primarily caused by the 1% cap on property tax increases. Inflation, changing community needs and increased demand for services cause service costs to rise annually - by more than 1%. This creates a budget deficit. Everett\u2019s deficit is projected to be $12.6 million next year \u2013 and it could grow to over $35 million.\u00a0Everett is not alone in these challenges; cities throughout the state have and are facing similar budget issues, leading to over 60 other Washington cities pursuing property tax levy increases since 2011.Over the years, many efforts have been made to close the budget gap. Since 2018, nearly all recreation programs, lifeguards at Silver Lake, the swim center, the petting zoo and the Bookmobile have been eliminated. The City has found private partners to take on programs like the Carl Gipson Center and the Jetty Island Days program and has worked to become more efficient and streamline processes. To bring in additional revenue, the City has pursued grants and other outside funding, increased or added fees or taxes and encouraged economic development.\u00a0Since January, the Finance team has provided briefings to the Council on the City\u2019s financial position, the structural deficit and revenue options that could help address the issues. While regionalization of some services was discussed, the only option that could be implemented by 2025 would be a levy lid lift.\u00a0Next stepsThe ballot measure and related materials were transmitted to the Snohomish County Auditor\u2019s Office on Friday, May 3, 2024. This measure will appear on Everett residents\u2019 August 6, 2024 ballot.\u00a0If the property tax ballot measure if approved, it would go into effect on January 1, 2025 and would only increase the City of Everett\u2019s portion of property tax.\u00a0Rejection of the levy would mean further cuts to quality of life and essential services provided or supported by the City of Everett. For 2025, the City would need to find $12.6 million in cuts to balance its budget.Learn moreTo learn more about City of Everett Proposition 1: Levy Lid Lift for Public Safety and Essential Public

10, 2024Everett City Council approves resolution for property tax ballot measure for August election EVERETT, Wash. \u2013 At the Wednesday, May 1, 2024 meeting, the Everett City Council passed a resolution in support of adding a property tax levy lid lift ballot measure to the August 6, 2024 primary election. The measure being put before Everett voters, titled \u201cProposition 1: Levy Lid Lift for Public Safety and Essential Public Services,\u201d asks for a moderate property tax increase, less than $30 per month for the average homeowner, to fund public safety and essential services.\u00a0\u201cThis ballot measure is critical for sustaining our quality of life here in Everett \u2013 providing much needed funding for our essential public services including police and fire; support for those struggling within our community; and our beloved parks, libraries, animal shelter and neighborhood associations,\u201d said Everett Mayor Cassie Franklin. \u201cThese services and programs are important elements of what makes our city a great place to live, work and play here and I appreciate our council members for moving this measure forward.\u201dProposition 1 would increase Everett\u2019s property levy rate to $2.19/ $1,000 of assessed value, which amounts to an overall increase of about $28 per month for a $500,000 home (based on assessed value). If passed, this measure would help fund public safety, park maintenance, libraries, the animal shelter, street maintenance, support for neighborhood associations, social services for those in need, the arts, community events; and more.\u00a0This also includes exploring the return of some pandemic era service cuts. A priority will be placed on public safety, including police and fire services, as well as options to re-open the Forest Park Pool through a public private partnership, add a full-time staff position to the Office of the Neighborhoods, and expand library hours.\u201cI\u2019m very proud that Everett is a full-service city \u2013 providing a variety of important services and quality of life amenities for our residents, businesses and visitors,\u201d said Council President Don Schwab. \u201cThis increase will help sustain our service levels and prioritize public safety as well as allow us to look into options to bring back some programs we previously cut.\u201d\u201cAfter months of analysis, community input and multiple Council discussions, I\u2019m glad to see this choice going to our voters. This measure will help ensure adequate funds for our programs and services and get the City on a path toward a more stable financial future,\u201d said Council Vice President Ben Zarlingo.\u201cEnsuring Everett\u2019s vitality means investing in our foundational stability,\u201d said Councilmember Paula Rhyne. \u201cThis request to voters is a responsible step towards investing in the essential services our city residents rely on and expect from a municipal government and a commitment to our residents' safety and well-being.\u201d\u00a0Background on Everett\u2019s budget challengesThe City of Everett is pursuing a property tax increase to help address its ongoing budget deficit. For over 20 years, the City of Everett has faced a structural deficit, primarily caused by the 1% cap on property tax increases. Inflation, changing community needs and increased demand for services cause service costs to rise annually - by more than 1%. This creates a budget deficit. Everett\u2019s deficit is projected to be $12.6 million next year \u2013 and it could grow to over $35 million.\u00a0Everett is not alone in these challenges; cities throughout the state have and are facing similar budget issues, leading to over 60 other Washington cities pursuing property tax levy increases since 2011.Over the years, many efforts have been made to close the budget gap. Since 2018, nearly all recreation programs, lifeguards at Silver Lake, the swim center, the petting zoo and the Bookmobile have been eliminated. The City has found private partners to take on programs like the Carl Gipson Center and the Jetty Island Days program and has worked to become more efficient and streamline processes. To bring in additional revenue, the City has pursued grants and other outside funding, increased or added fees or taxes and encouraged economic development.\u00a0Since January, the Finance team has provided briefings to the Council on the City\u2019s financial position, the structural deficit and revenue options that could help address the issues. While regionalization of some services was discussed, the only option that could be implemented by 2025 would be a levy lid lift.\u00a0Next stepsThe ballot measure and related materials were transmitted to the Snohomish County Auditor\u2019s Office on Friday, May 3, 2024. This measure will appear on Everett residents\u2019 August 6, 2024 ballot.\u00a0If the property tax ballot measure if approved, it would go into effect on January 1, 2025 and would only increase the City of Everett\u2019s portion of property tax.\u00a0Rejection of the levy would mean further cuts to quality of life and essential services provided or supported by the City of Everett. For 2025, the City would need to find $12.6 million in cuts to balance its budget.Learn moreTo learn more about City of Everett Proposition 1: Levy Lid Lift for Public Safety and Essential Public

10, 2024Everett City Council approves resolution for property tax ballot measure for August election EVERETT, Wash. \u2013 At the Wednesday, May 1, 2024 meeting, the Everett City Council passed a resolution in support of adding a property tax levy lid lift ballot measure to the August 6, 2024 primary election. The measure being put before Everett voters, titled \u201cProposition 1: Levy Lid Lift for Public Safety and Essential Public Services,\u201d asks for a moderate property tax increase, less than $30 per month for the average homeowner, to fund public safety and essential services.\u00a0\u201cThis ballot measure is critical for sustaining our quality of life here in Everett \u2013 providing much needed funding for our essential public services including police and fire; support for those struggling within our community; and our beloved parks, libraries, animal shelter and neighborhood associations,\u201d said Everett Mayor Cassie Franklin. \u201cThese services and programs are important elements of what makes our city a great place to live, work and play here and I appreciate our council members for moving this measure forward.\u201dProposition 1 would increase Everett\u2019s property levy rate to $2.19/ $1,000 of assessed value, which amounts to an overall increase of about $28 per month for a $500,000 home (based on assessed value). If passed, this measure would help fund public safety, park maintenance, libraries, the animal shelter, street maintenance, support for neighborhood associations, social services for those in need, the arts, community events; and more.\u00a0This also includes exploring the return of some pandemic era service cuts. A priority will be placed on public safety, including police and fire services, as well as options to re-open the Forest Park Pool through a public private partnership, add a full-time staff position to the Office of the Neighborhoods, and expand library hours.\u201cI\u2019m very proud that Everett is a full-service city \u2013 providing a variety of important services and quality of life amenities for our residents, businesses and visitors,\u201d said Council President Don Schwab. \u201cThis increase will help sustain our service levels and prioritize public safety as well as allow us to look into options to bring back some programs we previously cut.\u201d\u201cAfter months of analysis, community input and multiple Council discussions, I\u2019m glad to see this choice going to our voters. This measure will help ensure adequate funds for our programs and services and get the City on a path toward a more stable financial future,\u201d said Council Vice President Ben Zarlingo.\u201cEnsuring Everett\u2019s vitality means investing in our foundational stability,\u201d said Councilmember Paula Rhyne. \u201cThis request to voters is a responsible step towards investing in the essential services our city residents rely on and expect from a municipal government and a commitment to our residents' safety and well-being.\u201d\u00a0Background on Everett\u2019s budget challengesThe City of Everett is pursuing a property tax increase to help address its ongoing budget deficit. For over 20 years, the City of Everett has faced a structural deficit, primarily caused by the 1% cap on property tax increases. Inflation, changing community needs and increased demand for services cause service costs to rise annually - by more than 1%. This creates a budget deficit. Everett\u2019s deficit is projected to be $12.6 million next year \u2013 and it could grow to over $35 million.\u00a0Everett is not alone in these challenges; cities throughout the state have and are facing similar budget issues, leading to over 60 other Washington cities pursuing property tax levy increases since 2011.Over the years, many efforts have been made to close the budget gap. Since 2018, nearly all recreation programs, lifeguards at Silver Lake, the swim center, the petting zoo and the Bookmobile have been eliminated. The City has found private partners to take on programs like the Carl Gipson Center and the Jetty Island Days program and has worked to become more efficient and streamline processes. To bring in additional revenue, the City has pursued grants and other outside funding, increased or added fees or taxes and encouraged economic development.\u00a0Since January, the Finance team has provided briefings to the Council on the City\u2019s financial position, the structural deficit and revenue options that could help address the issues. While regionalization of some services was discussed, the only option that could be implemented by 2025 would be a levy lid lift.\u00a0Next stepsThe ballot measure and related materials were transmitted to the Snohomish County Auditor\u2019s Office on Friday, May 3, 2024. This measure will appear on Everett residents\u2019 August 6, 2024 ballot.\u00a0If the property tax ballot measure if approved, it would go into effect on January 1, 2025 and would only increase the City of Everett\u2019s portion of property tax.\u00a0Rejection of the levy would mean further cuts to quality of life and essential services provided or supported by the City of Everett. For 2025, the City would need to find $12.6 million in cuts to balance its budget.Learn moreTo learn more about City of Everett Proposition 1: Levy Lid Lift for Public Safety and Essential Public

10, 2024Everett City Council approves resolution for property tax ballot measure for August election EVERETT, Wash. \u2013 At the Wednesday, May 1, 2024 meeting, the Everett City Council passed a resolution in support of adding a property tax levy lid lift ballot measure to the August 6, 2024 primary election. The measure being put before Everett voters, titled \u201cProposition 1: Levy Lid Lift for Public Safety and Essential Public Services,\u201d asks for a moderate property tax increase, less than $30 per month for the average homeowner, to fund public safety and essential services.\u00a0\u201cThis ballot measure is critical for sustaining our quality of life here in Everett \u2013 providing much needed funding for our essential public services including police and fire; support for those struggling within our community; and our beloved parks, libraries, animal shelter and neighborhood associations,\u201d said Everett Mayor Cassie Franklin. \u201cThese services and programs are important elements of what makes our city a great place to live, work and play here and I appreciate our council members for moving this measure forward.\u201dProposition 1 would increase Everett\u2019s property levy rate to $2.19/ $1,000 of assessed value, which amounts to an overall increase of about $28 per month for a $500,000 home (based on assessed value). If passed, this measure would help fund public safety, park maintenance, libraries, the animal shelter, street maintenance, support for neighborhood associations, social services for those in need, the arts, community events; and more.\u00a0This also includes exploring the return of some pandemic era service cuts. A priority will be placed on public safety, including police and fire services, as well as options to re-open the Forest Park Pool through a public private partnership, add a full-time staff position to the Office of the Neighborhoods, and expand library hours.\u201cI\u2019m very proud that Everett is a full-service city \u2013 providing a variety of important services and quality of life amenities for our residents, businesses and visitors,\u201d said Council President Don Schwab. \u201cThis increase will help sustain our service levels and prioritize public safety as well as allow us to look into options to bring back some programs we previously cut.\u201d\u201cAfter months of analysis, community input and multiple Council discussions, I\u2019m glad to see this choice going to our voters. This measure will help ensure adequate funds for our programs and services and get the City on a path toward a more stable financial future,\u201d said Council Vice President Ben Zarlingo.\u201cEnsuring Everett\u2019s vitality means investing in our foundational stability,\u201d said Councilmember Paula Rhyne. \u201cThis request to voters is a responsible step towards investing in the essential services our city residents rely on and expect from a municipal government and a commitment to our residents' safety and well-being.\u201d\u00a0Background on Everett\u2019s budget challengesThe City of Everett is pursuing a property tax increase to help address its ongoing budget deficit. For over 20 years, the City of Everett has faced a structural deficit, primarily caused by the 1% cap on property tax increases. Inflation, changing community needs and increased demand for services cause service costs to rise annually - by more than 1%. This creates a budget deficit. Everett\u2019s deficit is projected to be $12.6 million next year \u2013 and it could grow to over $35 million.\u00a0Everett is not alone in these challenges; cities throughout the state have and are facing similar budget issues, leading to over 60 other Washington cities pursuing property tax levy increases since 2011.Over the years, many efforts have been made to close the budget gap. Since 2018, nearly all recreation programs, lifeguards at Silver Lake, the swim center, the petting zoo and the Bookmobile have been eliminated. The City has found private partners to take on programs like the Carl Gipson Center and the Jetty Island Days program and has worked to become more efficient and streamline processes. To bring in additional revenue, the City has pursued grants and other outside funding, increased or added fees or taxes and encouraged economic development.\u00a0Since January, the Finance team has provided briefings to the Council on the City\u2019s financial position, the structural deficit and revenue options that could help address the issues.

The measure being put before Everett voters, titled \u201cProposition 1: Levy Lid Lift for Public Safety and Essential Public Services,\u201d asks for a moderate property tax increase, less than $30 per month for the average homeowner, to fund public safety and essential services.\u00a0\u201cThis ballot measure is critical for sustaining our quality of life here in Everett \u2013 providing much needed funding for our essential public services including police and fire; support for those struggling within our community; and our beloved parks, libraries, animal shelter and neighborhood associations,\u201d said Everett Mayor Cassie Franklin. \u201cThese services and programs are important elements of what makes our city a great place to live, work and play here and I appreciate our council members for moving this measure forward.\u201dProposition 1 would increase Everett\u2019s property levy rate to $2.19/ $1,000 of assessed value, which amounts to an overall increase of about $28 per month for a $500,000 home (based on assessed value). If passed, this measure would help fund public safety, park maintenance, libraries, the animal shelter, street maintenance, support for neighborhood associations, social services for those in need, the arts, community events; and more.\u00a0This also includes exploring the return of some pandemic era service cuts. A priority will be placed on public safety, including police and fire services, as well as options to re-open the Forest Park Pool through a public private partnership, add a full-time staff position to the Office of the Neighborhoods, and expand library hours.\u201cI\u2019m very proud that Everett is a full-service city \u2013 providing a variety of important services and quality of life amenities for our residents, businesses and visitors,\u201d said Council President Don Schwab. \u201cThis increase will help sustain our service levels and prioritize public safety as well as allow us to look into options to bring back some programs we previously cut.\u201d\u201cAfter months of analysis, community input and multiple Council discussions, I\u2019m glad to see this choice going to our voters. This measure will help ensure adequate funds for our programs and services and get the City on a path toward a more stable financial future,\u201d said Council Vice President Ben Zarlingo.\u201cEnsuring Everett\u2019s vitality means investing in our foundational stability,\u201d said Councilmember Paula Rhyne. \u201cThis request to voters is a responsible step towards investing in the essential services our city residents rely on and expect from a municipal government and a commitment to our residents' safety and well-being.\u201d\u00a0Background on Everett\u2019s budget challengesThe City of Everett is pursuing a property tax increase to help address its ongoing budget deficit. For over 20 years, the City of Everett has faced a structural deficit, primarily caused by the 1% cap on property tax increases. Inflation, changing community needs and increased demand for services cause service costs to rise annually - by more than 1%. This creates a budget deficit. Everett\u2019s deficit is projected to be $12.6 million next year \u2013 and it could grow to over $35 million.\u00a0Everett is not alone in these challenges; cities throughout the state have and are facing similar budget issues, leading to over 60 other Washington cities pursuing property tax levy increases since 2011.Over the years, many efforts have been made to close the budget gap. Since 2018, nearly all recreation programs, lifeguards at Silver Lake, the swim center, the petting zoo and the Bookmobile have been eliminated. The City has found private partners to take on programs like the Carl Gipson Center and the Jetty Island Days program and has worked to become more efficient and streamline processes. To bring in additional revenue, the City has pursued grants and other outside funding, increased or added fees or taxes and encouraged economic development.\u00a0Since January, the Finance team has provided briefings to the Council on the City\u2019s financial position, the structural deficit and revenue options that could help address the issues. While regionalization of some services was discussed, the only option that could be implemented by 2025 would be a levy lid lift.\u00a0Next stepsThe ballot measure and related materials were transmitted to the Snohomish County Auditor\u2019s Office on Friday, May 3, 2024.

The measure being put before Everett voters, titled \u201cProposition 1: Levy Lid Lift for Public Safety and Essential Public Services,\u201d asks for a moderate property tax increase, less than $30 per month for the average homeowner, to fund public safety and essential services.\u00a0\u201cThis ballot measure is critical for sustaining our quality of life here in Everett \u2013 providing much needed funding for our essential public services including police and fire; support for those struggling within our community; and our beloved parks, libraries, animal shelter and neighborhood associations,\u201d said Everett Mayor Cassie Franklin. \u201cThese services and programs are important elements of what makes our city a great place to live, work and play here and I appreciate our council members for moving this measure forward.\u201dProposition 1 would increase Everett\u2019s property levy rate to $2.19/ $1,000 of assessed value, which amounts to an overall increase of about $28 per month for a $500,000 home (based on assessed value). If passed, this measure would help fund public safety, park maintenance, libraries, the animal shelter, street maintenance, support for neighborhood associations, social services for those in need, the arts, community events; and more.\u00a0This also includes exploring the return of some pandemic era service cuts. A priority will be placed on public safety, including police and fire services, as well as options to re-open the Forest Park Pool through a public private partnership, add a full-time staff position to the Office of the Neighborhoods, and expand library hours.\u201cI\u2019m very proud that Everett is a full-service city \u2013 providing a variety of important services and quality of life amenities for our residents, businesses and visitors,\u201d said Council President Don Schwab. \u201cThis increase will help sustain our service levels and prioritize public safety as well as allow us to look into options to bring back some programs we previously cut.\u201d\u201cAfter months of analysis, community input and multiple Council discussions, I\u2019m glad to see this choice going to our voters. This measure will help ensure adequate funds for our programs and services and get the City on a path toward a more stable financial future,\u201d said Council Vice President Ben Zarlingo.\u201cEnsuring Everett\u2019s vitality means investing in our foundational stability,\u201d said Councilmember Paula Rhyne. \u201cThis request to voters is a responsible step towards investing in the essential services our city residents rely on and expect from a municipal government and a commitment to our residents' safety and well-being.\u201d\u00a0Background on Everett\u2019s budget challengesThe City of Everett is pursuing a property tax increase to help address its ongoing budget deficit. For over 20 years, the City of Everett has faced a structural deficit, primarily caused by the 1% cap on property tax increases. Inflation, changing community needs and increased demand for services cause service costs to rise annually - by more than 1%. This creates a budget deficit. Everett\u2019s deficit is projected to be $12.6 million next year \u2013 and it could grow to over $35 million.\u00a0Everett is not alone in these challenges; cities throughout the state have and are facing similar budget issues, leading to over 60 other Washington cities pursuing property tax levy increases since 2011.Over the years, many efforts have been made to close the budget gap. Since 2018, nearly all recreation programs, lifeguards at Silver Lake, the swim center, the petting zoo and the Bookmobile have been eliminated. The City has found private partners to take on programs like the Carl Gipson Center and the Jetty Island Days program and has worked to become more efficient and streamline processes. To bring in additional revenue, the City has pursued grants and other outside funding, increased or added fees or taxes and encouraged economic development.\u00a0Since January, the Finance team has provided briefings to the Council on the City\u2019s financial position, the structural deficit and revenue options that could help address the issues. While regionalization of some services was discussed, the only option that could be implemented by 2025 would be a levy lid lift.\u00a0Next stepsThe ballot measure and related materials were transmitted to the Snohomish County Auditor\u2019s Office on Friday, May 3, 2024.

The measure being put before Everett voters, titled \u201cProposition 1: Levy Lid Lift for Public Safety and Essential Public Services,\u201d asks for a moderate property tax increase, less than $30 per month for the average homeowner, to fund public safety and essential services.\u00a0\u201cThis ballot measure is critical for sustaining our quality of life here in Everett \u2013 providing much needed funding for our essential public services including police and fire; support for those struggling within our community; and our beloved parks, libraries, animal shelter and neighborhood associations,\u201d said Everett Mayor Cassie Franklin. \u201cThese services and programs are important elements of what makes our city a great place to live, work and play here and I appreciate our council members for moving this measure forward.\u201dProposition 1 would increase Everett\u2019s property levy rate to $2.19/ $1,000 of assessed value, which amounts to an overall increase of about $28 per month for a $500,000 home (based on assessed value). If passed, this measure would help fund public safety, park maintenance, libraries, the animal shelter, street maintenance, support for neighborhood associations, social services for those in need, the arts, community events; and more.\u00a0This also includes exploring the return of some pandemic era service cuts. A priority will be placed on public safety, including police and fire services, as well as options to re-open the Forest Park Pool through a public private partnership, add a full-time staff position to the Office of the Neighborhoods, and expand library hours.\u201cI\u2019m very proud that Everett is a full-service city \u2013 providing a variety of important services and quality of life amenities for our residents, businesses and visitors,\u201d said Council President Don Schwab. \u201cThis increase will help sustain our service levels and prioritize public safety as well as allow us to look into options to bring back some programs we previously cut.\u201d\u201cAfter months of analysis, community input and multiple Council discussions, I\u2019m glad to see this choice going to our voters. This measure will help ensure adequate funds for our programs and services and get the City on a path toward a more stable financial future,\u201d said Council Vice President Ben Zarlingo.\u201cEnsuring Everett\u2019s vitality means investing in our foundational stability,\u201d said Councilmember Paula Rhyne. \u201cThis request to voters is a responsible step towards investing in the essential services our city residents rely on and expect from a municipal government and a commitment to our residents' safety and well-being.\u201d\u00a0Background on Everett\u2019s budget challengesThe City of Everett is pursuing a property tax increase to help address its ongoing budget deficit. For over 20 years, the City of Everett has faced a structural deficit, primarily caused by the 1% cap on property tax increases. Inflation, changing community needs and increased demand for services cause service costs to rise annually - by more than 1%. This creates a budget deficit. Everett\u2019s deficit is projected to be $12.6 million next year \u2013 and it could grow to over $35 million.\u00a0Everett is not alone in these challenges; cities throughout the state have and are facing similar budget issues, leading to over 60 other Washington cities pursuing property tax levy increases since 2011.Over the years, many efforts have been made to close the budget gap. Since 2018, nearly all recreation programs, lifeguards at Silver Lake, the swim center, the petting zoo and the Bookmobile have been eliminated. The City has found private partners to take on programs like the Carl Gipson Center and the Jetty Island Days program and has worked to become more efficient and streamline processes. To bring in additional revenue, the City has pursued grants and other outside funding, increased or added fees or taxes and encouraged economic development.\u00a0Since January, the Finance team has provided briefings to the Council on the City\u2019s financial position, the structural deficit and revenue options that could help address the issues. While regionalization of some services was discussed, the only option that could be implemented by 2025 would be a levy lid lift.\u00a0Next stepsThe ballot measure and related materials were transmitted to the Snohomish County Auditor\u2019s Office on Friday, May 3, 2024.

A priority will be placed on public safety, including police and fire services, as well as options to re-open the Forest Park Pool through a public private partnership, add a full-time staff position to the Office of the Neighborhoods, and expand library hours.\u201cI\u2019m very proud that Everett is a full-service city \u2013 providing a variety of important services and quality of life amenities for our residents, businesses and visitors,\u201d said Council President Don Schwab. \u201cThis increase will help sustain our service levels and prioritize public safety as well as allow us to look into options to bring back some programs we previously cut.\u201d\u201cAfter months of analysis, community input and multiple Council discussions, I\u2019m glad to see this choice going to our voters. This measure will help ensure adequate funds for our programs and services and get the City on a path toward a more stable financial future,\u201d said Council Vice President Ben Zarlingo.\u201cEnsuring Everett\u2019s vitality means investing in our foundational stability,\u201d said Councilmember Paula Rhyne. \u201cThis request to voters is a responsible step towards investing in the essential services our city residents rely on and expect from a municipal government and a commitment to our residents' safety and well-being.\u201d\u00a0Background on Everett\u2019s budget challengesThe City of Everett is pursuing a property tax increase to help address its ongoing budget deficit. For over 20 years, the City of Everett has faced a structural deficit, primarily caused by the 1% cap on property tax increases. Inflation, changing community needs and increased demand for services cause service costs to rise annually - by more than 1%. This creates a budget deficit. Everett\u2019s deficit is projected to be $12.6 million next year \u2013 and it could grow to over $35 million.\u00a0Everett is not alone in these challenges; cities throughout the state have and are facing similar budget issues, leading to over 60 other Washington cities pursuing property tax levy increases since 2011.Over the years, many efforts have been made to close the budget gap. Since 2018, nearly all recreation programs, lifeguards at Silver Lake, the swim center, the petting zoo and the Bookmobile have been eliminated. The City has found private partners to take on programs like the Carl Gipson Center and the Jetty Island Days program and has worked to become more efficient and streamline processes. To bring in additional revenue, the City has pursued grants and other outside funding, increased or added fees or taxes and encouraged economic development.\u00a0Since January, the Finance team has provided briefings to the Council on the City\u2019s financial position, the structural deficit and revenue options that could help address the issues. While regionalization of some services was discussed, the only option that could be implemented by 2025 would be a levy lid lift.\u00a0Next stepsThe ballot measure and related materials were transmitted to the Snohomish County Auditor\u2019s Office on Friday, May 3, 2024. This measure will appear on Everett residents\u2019 August 6, 2024 ballot.\u00a0If the property tax ballot measure if approved, it would go into effect on January 1, 2025 and would only increase the City of Everett\u2019s portion of property tax.\u00a0Rejection of the levy would mean further cuts to quality of life and essential services provided or supported by the City of Everett. For 2025, the City would need to find $12.6 million in cuts to balance its budget.Learn moreTo learn more about City of Everett Proposition 1: Levy Lid Lift for Public Safety and Essential Public

        "text": "Next Ukrainian presidential election\nPresidential elections were scheduled to be held in Ukraine in March or April 2024. However, as martial law has been in effect since 24 February 2022 in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, no elections were held because Ukrainian law does not allow presidential elections to be held when martial law is in effect.[1][2][3][4][5][6] Martial law has been extended in 90-day intervals since the full-scale invasion with parliament's approval, and has most recently (as of October 2024 ) been extended for the 13th time until 7 February 2025.[7]\n\nBackground\n\nPostponement\n\nArticle 19 of Ukraine's \"On the Legal Regime of Martial Law\" bans presidential, parliamentary, and local elections under martial law,[8] while Article 10 states that the powers of the president, parliament, and Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine cannot be terminated under martial law.[9][10] Article 108 of the Constitution of Ukraine stipulates that \"The President of Ukraine exercises his or her powers until the assumption of office by the newly-elected President of Ukraine\",[11] allowing incumbent President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to legitimately remain president until the next president is sworn in, even after the expiration of the five-year term to which he was elected in 2019.[12]\n\nApart from the legal prohibition, both government and opposition politicians in Ukraine questioned the feasibility of a 2024 election, citing concerns over security and displaced voters[2][12] as the Russian invasion continued. Russia controls 18% of Ukraine's territory as of October 2024 ,[13] and nearly 14 million Ukrainians have either fled abroad or been displaced internally.[2][12][8] Other challenges identified include danger to voters and likely disruption of the voting process[8] due to Russian bombardment;[14] the inability of citizens in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine to vote;[14] the inability of soldiers to vote or run as candidates;[12] damaged polling infrastructure;[12] an outdated voter registry that has not been updated to reflect millions of displaced voters;[8] expanded state powers and restricted rights under martial law that would limit campaigning[8] and prevent fair competition for opposition candidates;[15] and the lack of funds.[12]\n\nA poll released by KIIS in October 2023 reported that 81% of Ukrainians did not want elections until the war was over,[16] and more than 200 civil society institutions, NGOs, and human rights groups have formally opposed wartime elections.[14] In November 2023, Zelenskyy said \"now is not the right time for elections\", in response to a claim by European Solidarity MP Oleksiy Goncharenko that Zelenskyy had decided to hold elections on 31 March 2024.[17] Later in the same month, all political parties represented in the Verkhovna Rada signed a document in which they agreed to postpone holding any national election until after the end of martial law[18] and agreed to work on a special law that would regulate the first post-war election, which would take place no earlier than six months after the cancellation of martial law.[19]\n\nElectoral system\n\nThe President of Ukraine is elected for a five-year term using the two-round system; if no candidate receives an absolute majority in the first round, a second round is expected to take place three weeks after the first. According to Article 103 of the constitution, in the event of pre-term termination of presidential authority, the election of a new president must take place within 90 days of the previous president's departure from office.[20]\n\nThe constitution limits presidents to serving two terms in office.\n\nAnnounced intent to run\n\nOpinion polls",

Generate Key Takeaways\n\nAfter Donald Trump lost the White House in the 2020 presidential election, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner made a decisive choice to exit politics for good \u2014 or so the public thought. There are rumblings behind the scenes that the former president\u2019s eldest daughter is reconsidering her position.\n\nIvanka and Kushner have appeared content to resume their socialite life by relocating to Miami after Donald Trump\u2019s administration. The social scene in Florida has accepted their presence more warmly than their former New York City pals as they focused on their post-White House and their young family. Perhaps that wasn\u2019t enough as Puck News is now revealing that she might be having a change of heart. According to their Trump family source, Ivanka is \u201cwarming to the idea of trying to be helpful\u201d with her father\u2019s campaign.\n\nMore from SheKnows\n\nWASHINGTON, DC \u2013 JANUARY 31: US President Donald Trump and Senior Advisor to President Trump, Ivanka Trump participate in the \u201cWhite House Summit on Human Trafficking: The 20th Anniversary of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000\u201d event in the East Room of the White House on January 31, 2020 in Washington, DC.\n\nShe\u2019s not jumping in head-first, instead, she\u2019s \u201cprivately not ruling out having some sort of role.\u201d Her way of thinking is no longer \u201c\u2018Hell no\u2019 anymore.\u201d Ivanka is trying to keep her possible return to politics under the radar for now, though. A spokesperson for the couple told the media outlet, \u201cAs they\u2019ve both repeatedly stated, Ivanka and Jared continue to focus on their family and lives in the private sector and do not intend to go back to politics.\u201d Ivanka isn\u2019t suddenly going to pop up on the campaign trail if she decides to help Donald Trump. Instead, the insider revealed that her return to politics would be timed to the Republican National Convention in mid-July for greater impact.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cAfter a longstanding position of ruling it out, she\u2019s more open to it,\u201d the source added. \u201cIt\u2019s getting more real, it\u2019s revving up.\u201d The one thing political watchers should probably cross off their list is a Kushner return. He\u2019s reportedly satisfied with his very lucrative Miami-based investment firm, Affinity Partners, which is already controversial for the significant investment from Saudi Arabia. The insider pointed out that Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law would benefit the least from a second White House term because of the conflict of interest of mixing business and politics \u2014 although that\u2019s never stopped the Trumps before.\n\nVoters will soon find out if Ivanka meant what she said in her November 2022 statement after Donald Trump announced his third run for president. \u201cI love my father very much,\u201d she said. \u201cThis time around, I am choosing to prioritize my young children and the private life we are creating as a family. I do not plan to be involved in politics.\u201d It sounds like Washington, D.C. is calling Ivanka again.\n\nBefore you go, click here to see every time Ivanka Trump has tried to distance herself from the Trump family:\n\nIvanka Trump\n\nBest of SheKnows\n\nSign up for SheKnows' Newsletter.

        "text": "Carnegie Fellowship\nProfessor Mara Suttmann-Lea awarded $200,000 Carnegie Fellowship for elections research\n\nAssistant Professor of Government Mara Suttmann-Lea is one of 28 distinguished scholars out of a record high 360 nominees awarded the highly prestigious $200,000 Carnegie Fellowship in 2024, the Carnegie Corporation of New York announced today. Only a few of these fellowships have ever gone to researchers based at liberal arts colleges; of this year\u2019s 28 fellows, 12 are junior scholars, 15 are senior scholars, 11 are employed by state universities, 16 by private universities and one is a journalist.\n\nSuttmann-Lea will study how state and local election officials can build trust with constituents through voter education, bolstering the public\u2019s resilience to misinformation-driven polarization and bringing the public closer to a shared understanding of how elections are run in the United States.\n\nThe Carnegie Fellows program began in 2015 to continue the mission of Carnegie Corporation of New York, as founded by Andrew Carnegie in 1911, to promote the advancement and diffusion of knowledge and understanding. Through a current focus on political polarization in the U.S., the Corporation seeks to raise awareness in the philanthropic sector, guide public policy and help inform the foundation\u2019s grantmaking in democracy, education and international peace and security. Each fellowship winner receives funding for research that seeks to understand how and why our society has become so polarized and how we can strengthen the forces of cohesion to fortify our democracy.\n\nTo that point, Suttmann-Lea wrote in their project proposal, \u201cAmong the many indicators of political polarization in the United States, none is more alarming for the future of American democracy than election denial\u2014the belief that election outcomes are fraudulent and not to be trusted. My Carnegie Fellowship proposal is motivated by the existential threat posed by the persistent belief among a substantial portion of the American public who adheres to election denialism. Left unchecked, the consequences of election denialism are dire. In addition to discouraging democratic participation, a lack of trust in elections motivates people to turn to acts of political violence.\u201d\n\nSuttmann-Lea\u2019s project builds upon their existing dataset of state and local election official communications on social media platforms and a survey of state election official practices to identify voter education strategies for depolarizing attitudes toward elections. For their Carnegie project, they plan to extend these data to include the 2024 presidential election cycle, a survey of local election official voter education efforts and a nationally representative survey of the public\u2019s preferred sources of election information and attitudes toward elections.\n\nThe cornerstone of the proposal is the creation of a voter education hub. \u201cThe hub will be the first of its kind space for election officials to access peer-reviewed best practices for building trust in elections among the public, lessons for their constituents about the process of election administration and a space for election officials to share and receive feedback on their own voter education practices,\u201d Suttmann-Lea said.\n\n\u201cThis project is original because no one has examined in a systematic way precisely what election officials communicate to their constituents, nor considered how voter education might be a solution to election denialism and polarization in attitudes toward elections.\u201d\n\nSuttmann-Lea, who joined the Connecticut College faculty in 2018, is a leading scholar of research on voter education and their findings have been used to support the work of American election officials. Suttmann-Lea\u2019s research has been funded by the Social Science Research Council, the M.I.T. Election Data and Science Lab and the United States Election Assistance Commission, and is featured in a range of scholarly and public-facing outlets. They are the founder of the podcast What Voting Means To Me, which features interviews with voters and non-voters about their experiences living in a democracy and conversations with scholars and election officials about what can be done to improve the health of American democracy.\n\nCarnegie Fellowships are awarded annually to approximately 30 exceptional scholars, authors, journalists and public intellectuals. The criteria prioritize the originality and promise of the research, its potential impact on the field and the scholar\u2019s plans for communicating the findings to a broad audience. The funding is for a period of one or two years with the anticipated result of a book or major study.",

        "text": "2024 Russian presidential election\nElection logo\n\nPresidential elections were held in Russia from 15 to 17 March 2024.[1][2][a] It was the eighth presidential election in the country. The incumbent president Vladimir Putin won with 88% of the vote, the highest percentage in a presidential election in post-Soviet Russia,[4] gaining a fifth term in what was widely viewed as a foregone conclusion.[5][6] He was inaugurated on 7 May 2024.[7][8]\n\nIn November 2023, Boris Nadezhdin, a former member of the State Duma, became the first person backed by a registered political party to announce his candidacy, running on an anti-war platform.[9] He was followed by incumbent and independent candidate Vladimir Putin in December 2023, who was eligible to seek re-election as a result of the 2020 constitutional amendments.[10][11][12] Later the same month, Leonid Slutsky of the Liberal Democratic Party, Nikolay Kharitonov of the Communist Party and Vladislav Davankov of New People announced their candidacies.\n\nOther candidates also declared their candidacy but were barred for various reasons by the Central Election Commission (CEC). As was the case in the 2018 presidential election, the most prominent opposition leader,[13][14] Alexei Navalny, was barred from running due to a prior criminal conviction seen as politically motivated.[15][16][17] Navalny died in prison in February 2024, weeks before the election, under suspicious circumstances.[18][19] Nadezhdin, despite passing the initial stages of the process, on 8 February 2024, was also barred from running. The decision was announced at a special CEC session, citing alleged irregularities in the signatures of voters supporting his candidacy. Nadezhdin's status as the only explicitly anti-war candidate was widely regarded as the real reason for his disqualification, although Davankov promised \"peace and negotiations on our own terms\".[20][21] As a result, Putin faced no credible opposition.[22][23] Anti-Putin activists called on voters to spoil their ballot. The elections saw 1.4 million invalid or blank ballots cast, around 1.6% of all votes cast, a 45 percent increase compared to the 2018 elections.\n\nMost international observers did not expect the election to be either free or fair,[24] with Putin having increased political repressions after launching his full-scale war with Ukraine in 2022.[25][26] The elections were also held in the Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine.[26][22][27] There were reports of irregularities, including ballot stuffing and coercion,[28][29] with statistical analysis suggesting unprecedented levels of fraud in the 2024 elections.[30]\n\nEligibility\n\nAccording to clause 3 of article 81 of the Constitution of Russia, prior to the 2020 constitutional revision, the same person could not hold the position of President of the Russian Federation for more than two consecutive terms, which allowed Vladimir Putin to become president in 2012 for a third term not consecutive with his prior terms.[31] The constitutional reform established a hard limit of two terms overall. However, terms served before the constitutional revision do not count, which gives Putin eligibility for two more presidential terms until 2036.[32]\n\nAccording to the new version of the Constitution, presidential candidates must:[33]\n\nBe at least 35 years old (the requirement has not changed);\n\nBe a resident in Russia for at least 25 years (previously 10 years);\n\nNot have foreign citizenship or residence permit in a foreign country, neither at the time of the election nor at any time before (new requirement).\n\nThe individuals below appeared on the ballot.[34]\n\nIndividuals in this section have had their document submissions accepted by the CEC to register their participation, and later gathered the necessary signatures from voters. The deadline to submit documents was 27 December 2023 for independents and 1 January 2024 for party-based nominations, with the commission already announcing the rejection of some candidates based on alleged issues with their paperwork.[40]\n\nTowards the deadline to submit documents, the CEC stated that 33 potential candidates were intending to be registered as candidates (24 independents and 9 party-based nominations). The commission accepted the documents of 15 candidates.[42]\n\nThe next step was to collect signatures by 31 January 2024. Independents had to gather 300,000 signatures from the public in at least 40 of Russia's federal subjects to support their participation and thereby be included on the ballot, while potential candidates nominated by political parties that are not represented in the State Duma or in at least a third of the country's regional parliaments had to gather 100,000 signatures.[43]\n\nVladimir Putin was the first to achieve this, having gathered more than half a million signatures by 30 December; by 17 January he had gathered 2.5 million signatures.[44][45] He was followed by Davankov, Kharitonov, Slutsky, Nadezhdin and Malinkovich (in no particular order). Others either failed to achieve this or withdrew from the process.[citation needed]\n\nThe CEC accepted the signatures of Putin, while rejecting Nadezhdin and Malinkovich on the basis of what it described to be irregularities. Davankov, Kharitonov and Slutsky were not required to collect signatures as they were nominated by political parties represented in the State Duma. This confirmed the final number of candidates at four.[citation needed]\n\nParty congresses and primaries\n\nCongresses of political parties are held after the official appointment of election. At the congress, a party can either nominate its own candidate, or support a candidate nominated by another party or an independent candidate. Twelve parties held party congresses in December 2023, at which candidates were either nominated or endorsed.\n\nOther parties\n\nAt Yabloko's congress, which took place on 9 December 2023, somewhat unconventionally, the party decided that Grigory Yavlinsky would run for president as its nominee if he obtains 10 million signatures from potential voters,[66] which is higher than the total number of votes Yavlinsky obtained during his most successful run for president (5.55 million).[67] Yabloko later stated that it would not be nominating any candidate.[68] Furthermore, Yavlinsky only managed to gather around a million signatures.[69]\n\nThe Left Front stated that it would run a primary election between 22 candidates, but later announced it would not be holding the primary due to threats received from the police.[70] Instead, the party called on their \"comrades in the Communist Party\" to vote for one of the following to be nominated at the party congress: Pavel Grudinin, Nikolai Bondarenko, Valentin Konovalov, Andrey Klychkov, Sergey Levchenko, Nina Ostanina, Igor Girkin.[citation needed]\n\nPreparation of public opinion\n\nIn June 2023, a few posters advocating for Yevgeny Prigozhin, leader of the Wagner Group private military company, were noticed[71] in Krasnodar, with a QR code to a website hinting at the 2024 election.[72] Prigozhin himself denied any relation to such posters and \"any political activity in the internet\",[72] but fuelled speculation that he was about to go into politics after holding press conferences across Russia[71] and leading the Wagner Group rebellion. He died in a plane crash later that year.\n\nAccording to an investigation published in February 2024 by a coalition of journals including VSquare, Delfi, Expressen and Paper Trail Media, Putin ordered Decree Number 2016, titled \"On deputy heads responsible for social and political work of federal government agencies\", on 17 February 2023. The decree stated its aim of coordination between the Ministry of Education and Science and other state agencies to \"increase the number of voters and the support of the main candidates\" in the 2024 presidential election and other elections. Documents from a governmental \"non-profit organisation\", ANO Integration, highlighted the emphasis on increasing the number of voters and the support of the main candidates, with turnout being used to indicate the scale of support and opposition to Putin.[73][74]\n\nThe ANO Integration documents presented a plan to create lists of all employees and sub-lists of opinion leaders in institutions within the ministry's responsibility, and to monitor political attitudes and voting preferences and \"increas[e] [the employee's] level of socio-political literacy\". The documents planned for the preparation of secret instructions for social events in which selected opinion leaders and \"experts\" would meet with students and teachers in preparation for the election. Martin Kragh [sv] of the Center for East European Studies in Stockholm described the documents by stating, \"All these documents show how little the Kremlin believes that people might just spontaneously support the ruling party\". Mark Galeotti, a British historian, lecturer and writer, described the process as \"pre-rigging\" the election in order to minimise the amount of manipulation needed in the numbers of votes cast for Putin in the election. He stated, \"The Kremlin cannot even trust what mayors and governors tell them about the [political] situation in their region.\"[73][75][76]\n\nWhen asked by a BBC journalist about his electoral campaign, Nikolay Kharitonov refused to answer why he thought he would be a better candidate than Putin, before proceeding to praise the latter for \"trying to solve a lot of the problems of the 1990s\" and consolidating the country for \"victory in all areas\".[77] Shortly after filing his candidacy in December 2023, Leonid Slutsky said he did not \"dream of beating Putin\" and predicted that the latter would achieve \"a huge victory\".[78] Vladislav Davankov said he would not criticize his political opponents.[79]\n\nConduct\n\nRussian-occupied territories of Ukraine\n\nEarly voting opened on 26 February and lasted until 14 March to allow certain residents in remote areas in 37 federal subjects of Russia as well as in the regions of Ukraine that it annexed following its invasion in 2022 to vote.[80][81] In the latter areas, a campaign called InformUIK was set up to encourage participation in the election, with its representatives going door-to-door escorted by armed men to compile voter lists and collect ballots from residences. A resident of Kherson Oblast described the elections in his area as a \"comedy show\", noting that households were being visited by \"two locals \u2013 one holding a list of voters and the other a ballot box \u2013 and a military man with a machine gun\".[82]\n\nRussian officials also used home visits by the mobile polling stations to monitor the population and find those participating in resistance activities or refusing to obtain Russian government documents.[83] Reports also emerged of Russian-installed authorities coercing people to vote by withholding social benefits and healthcare treatment, while human rights activists said at least 27 Ukrainians were arrested for refusing to vote in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia Oblasts.[29] Despite Russian electoral laws prohibiting those without Russian passports from voting, voters in occupied Ukraine were allowed to present any valid identification documents, including a Ukrainian passport or driving license.[84] In Melitopol, Zaporizhzhia Oblast, soldiers armed with machine guns sealed off apartments being visited by mobile polling teams.[85] In one instance, a man who fled his village near Mariupol, Donetsk Oblast, to Ukrainian-controlled territory following the Russian invasion alleged that his name appeared in Russian-produced voter lists and was listed as having voted for Putin by election officials.[86]\n\nEfforts to promote turnout\n\nVladimir Putin at the United Russia congress\n\nOn the eve of the first round of regular voting on 14 March, Putin called on citizens to vote in order to show their unity behind his leadership, saying in a video message that \"We have already shown that we can be together, defending the freedom, sovereignty and security of Russia,\" and urged them \"not to stray from this path\".[87]\n\nLatvia-based Russian news outlet Meduza reported that Kremlin officials asked Russia's regional governments to secure 70% voter turnout and more than 80% support for Putin.[74][88]\n\nCivil servants and employees at state-run companies were ordered to vote.[89] In Omsk, officials issued 50,000 free tickets at polling stations to first-time voters aged between 18 and 24 years of age for one Ferris wheel ride at an amusement park. In Altai Krai, voters were to be given a chance to win sanctioned goods and appliances such as an iPhone in a raffle, provided that they upload pictures on VKontakte showing them at polling stations. In Strezhevoy, Tomsk Oblast, the mayor promised free bread rolls and porridge to voters. In Sverdlovsk Oblast, authorities set up an election day trivia quiz about the region's history with and offered 2,000 smartphones, 45 apartments, 20 motorcycles, and 100 Moskvich cars as prizes, but said that correct answers would not guarantee a win. In Tatarstan, officials set a music festival in Kazan on 17 March that would be open to visitors upon presentation of a bracelet obtained at polling stations that would also guarantee free and unlimited access to public transportation, along with a chance to win in a raffle with three Lada Vesta cars at stake.[90]\n\nReports also emerged of pressure being exerted by authorities on students and young people to vote. Students at a construction college in Perm Krai were ordered to vote inside the campus, with the school administration pledging to monitor turnout using video surveillance cameras. At Tula State Pedagogical University, students were required to submit a photo of their ballot to prove that they voted. Its rector had also publicly endorsed Putin. At Voronezh State Pedagogical University, students said they were required to inform authorities about who they were voting for.[91]\n\nRegular voting\n\nPutin voted in the Russian presidential election online.\n\nOn the regular election days, polls opened at 08:00 local time in Kamchatka Krai on 15 March and are expected to close at 20:00 local time in Kaliningrad Oblast on 17 March.[87] Independent watchdogs were prevented from observing the conduct of the election, as only registered candidates and state-backed advisory bodies were allowed to send observers to polling stations. The independent election monitor Golos described the election as the \"most vapid\" since the 2000 election, noting that campaigning was \"practically unnoticeable\" and that authorities were \"doing everything\" to prevent people noticing that an election was taking place while state media provided less airtime to the election compared to 2018. It also described Putin's campaign as disguised by his activities as president, while his registered opponents were \"demonstrably passive\".[92]\n\nOn 15 March, the Kremlin published images of Putin casting his vote online using a computer in his office.[93] On the morning of the same day, the online voting system went down temporarily, with Golos and other independent electoral observers attributing the outage to the traffic generated by votes coming from workplaces.[94]\n\nAllegations of fraud\n\nStatistical analyses\n\nAccording to a Novaya Gazeta investigation using a method proposed by mathematician Sergey Shpilkin [ru], around 22 million of the non-online (polling booth) votes for Putin were falsified, out of 64.7 million non-online votes for Putin in total. Novaya Gazeta described the analysis showing \"record levels of fraud even for a Russian presidential election\".[95][96]\n\nMeduza carried out statistical analyses on the official results released by the CEC. Based on scatter plots of the vote percentage for Putin compared to turnout, a tail in which voter turnout visually correlates to Putin support, which appeared weakly in earlier Russian presidential elections, was found by Meduza to completely dominate in 2024. \"Churov's saw\", a statistical effect interpreted as fraudulent in which sharp peaks at round numbers appear in voter turnout and percentage votes for Putin, was found by Meduza to have strengthened in the 2024 election, with Meduza arguing that the number of polling stations with likely fraud became the majority in 2024, while earlier the fraction of fraudulent polling stations had been a minority. Overall, Meduza stated that the 2024 presidential election \"was almost certainly the most fraudulent\" in \"modern Russian history\", and that the \"sheer magnitude of fraud eclipses that of 2018\".[30]\n\nOther incidents of fraud\n\nOn 16 March, Golos released a video on social media appearing to show staff at a polling station in Krasnodar doing ballot stuffing.[97] It also said that it had received reports of attempts to inspect filled-out ballots before they were cast, and one instance in which police demanded a ballot box be opened to remove a ballot.[98] Thermochromic ink that disappears when heated was also allegedly used in Kursk and Rostov-on-Don on 15 March.[99] The usage of such ink was previously reported during the 2021 regional elections in Khimki.[100] Overall, Golos described the 2024 election as an \"imitation\", adding that it had not previously observed \"a presidential campaign that fell so short of constitutional standards\".[101]\n\nIncidents\n\nAttacks by Ukrainian and other armed groups\n\nAttacks have been launched against Russian electoral institutions in occupied areas of Ukraine. On the first day of early voting on 27 February 2024, two bombs were detonated at the local offices of the United Russia party and near a polling station in Nova Kakhovka, Kherson Oblast.[82] On 6 March, a local official of the Russian Central Election Commission in Berdiansk, Zaporizhzhia Oblast, was killed by a car bomb, according to Ukrainian officials.[102] When asked about the killing, the Ukrainian-appointed governor of the oblast, Ivan Fedorov, attributed the attack to \"our resistance\", adding that they were linked to Ukrainian secret services and that \"it is abnormal when our citizens collaborate with Russians\".[82] On 15 March, an improvised explosive device was detonated inside a trash can in front of a polling station in Skadovsk, Kherson Oblast,[103] injuring five Russian soldiers.[104] On 16 March, the Russian-installed governor of Kherson Oblast, Volodymyr Saldo claimed that one person was killed and four others were injured in a Ukrainian drone strike in Kakhovka, which he claimed was an attempt to disrupt voting, while TASS reported that a Ukrainian drone struck a polling station in Zaporizhzhia Oblast.[28]\n\nDuring an incursion into Kursk and Belgorod Oblasts on 12 March, the Sibir Battalion, an armed Russian opposition group based in Ukraine, published a video condemning the elections, saying that \"Ballots and polling stations in this case are fiction.\"[105] A member of the Freedom of Russia Legion, which also participated in the attacks, acknowledged that they were \"timed with the so-called elections\" and referred to it as a \"voting method\".[106] Putin also described the incursion as an attempt to \"disrupt\" the election and \"interfere with the normal process of expressing the will of citizens\".[107] Throughout the election, the border city of Belgorod was subjected to shelling and rocket attacks by Ukraine, killing two people in what most analysts believed to be an attempt to disrupt the vote and incite discontent against Putin by convincing Russians of his responsibility in bringing the war on Ukraine to Russian soil by launching the invasion in the first place, although the high turnout of 78 percent in Belgorod Oblast suggested that the strategy had led to increased support for Putin.[108]\n\nOn 25 March, the independent news outlet Mediazona reported that the Federal Security Service had arrested three people on suspicion of plotting an arson attack against a Putin campaign office in Barnaul, Altai Krai, prior to the election. One of the suspects was said to have been in contact with an \"unidentified terrorist organization\".[109]\n\nIncidents involving civilians\n\nDuring regular polling, several election-related incidents were reported across the country, resulting in at least 13 arrests, seven of which were for pouring liquid substances on ballot boxes and four for committing acts of arson in polling stations,[110] one of which involved a woman in Saint Petersburg who was arrested for throwing a molotov cocktail at a school hosting two polling stations after having allegedly been promised a financial incentive by a \"Ukrainian Telegram channel\".[111] A voting booth was also set on fire in Moscow.[112] In Podolsk, Moscow Oblast, a voter was charged with \"discrediting the Russian army\" and fined 30,000 rubles ($342) after spoiling her ballot by writing an unspecified message.[97] A voter in Saint Petersburg was ordered arrested on similar charges after writing the words \"No to War\" on her ballot.[113] Some voters uploaded images of them spoiling their ballots by writing messages such as \"killer and thief\" and \"waiting for you in The Hague\", a reference to the arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court against Putin over war crimes in Ukraine.[114]\n\nOn 17 March, a Moldovan national was arrested after throwing two molotov cocktails at the grounds of the Russian embassy [ro; ru] in Chi\u0219in\u0103u, which was being used as a polling station for Russian nationals in Moldova. Moldovan police said that the man, who also claimed to be carrying Russian citizenship, \"justified his action by some dissatisfaction he has with the actions of the Russian authorities\".[115]\n\nIn response to the attacks on polling stations, former president and deputy chair of the Security Council of Russia Dmitry Medvedev called for charges of treason to be filed against those who vandalize polling stations for attempting to derail the vote amid the fighting in Ukraine.[114]\n\nCyberattacks\n\nOn 16 March, the United Russia party said its website was targeted by a cyberattack.[116]\n\nOpinion polls\n\nExit polling\n\nExit polls on 17 March released by the Russian Public Opinion Research Center showed Vladimir Putin with 87% of the vote, 10% more than in 2018, Nikolai Kharitonov with 4.6%, Vladislav Davankov with 4.2% and Leonid Slutsky with 3%. Invalid ballots accounted for 1.2% of votes cast.[118]\n\nOverseas\n\nUnofficial exit polls results by country: Davankov: 70\u201380% Davankov: 60\u201370% Davankov: 50\u201360% Davankov: 40\u201350% Putin: 30\u201340% Putin: 40\u201350% Putin: 50\u201360% Putin: 80\u201390%\n\nOfficial results abroad.\n\nThe CEC said that 388,791 Russians cast their ballots from abroad.[119]\n\nIn contrast to the official exit polls and results of the election both inside and outside of Russia, unofficial exit polls of the votes cast abroad showed a much poorer performance for Putin. According to the Vote Abroad project,[120] Davankov won a plurality of the votes at most of the voting stations abroad, earning his best result in Trabzon. However, Putin secured pluralities in Genoa, Rome, Nicosia, Chi\u0219in\u0103u, Ankara, Samarkand and Bonn. He also won 59% in Athens, making it his best performance abroad.[121] Conversely, he got his worst showing in The Hague, with just 2% of the vote.[122] Putin won 3% in Poland, Serbia and Montenegro, and 8% in Almaty, Kazakhstan.[123]\n\nAccording to the Vote Abroad project, Putin was also voted for by 4% of Russians living in Lithuania and the Czech Republic, 5% in Istanbul, Turkey, 6% in Argentina and the United Kingdom, 7% in Austria, Ireland and Slovakia, 8% in Estonia, Denmark and Yerevan, Armenia, 9% in Portugal, 10% in Thailand, Finland and Berlin, Germany, 11% in Madrid, Spain and Paris, France, 13% in Norway, 14% in Sweden and Hungary, 15% in Vietnam and the United States, 16% in Tel Aviv, Israel and Bern, Switzerland, 17% in Japan, 22% in Cyprus, 23% in Milan, Italy, 31% in Dubai, 35% in Chi\u0219in\u0103u, Moldova and Uzbekistan, 36% in Kyrgyzstan and 38% in Rome, Italy.[120] In total, exit polls organized by exiled Russian activists across 44 countries showed Davankov gaining more votes than Putin in all but five countries.[124]\n\nThe election was also held in Moldova's Transnistria, an internationally unrecognized state. 46,179 people with Russian citizenship voted in the election, the lowest turnout in a Russian presidential election in the last 18 years. 97% voted for Putin, with the other three candidates not having even obtained 1,000 votes combined.[125] According to TRT Russian, the low turnout indicated changes in the political activity of Transnistrians with Russian citizenship, with over 73,000 having participated in the last election six years ago. Furthermore, it stated Moldovan analysts believed the low turnout indicated a trend that Transnistria was moving away from Russia and that Moldovan President Maia Sandu's pro-European policy was influencing the region.[126]\n\nElection observers\n\nThe domestic watchdog Golos, having been previously labelled a \"foreign agent\" in 2013 after documenting fraud in the 2011 parliamentary vote and the 2012 presidential election, was not allowed to send election observers. [127][128]\n\nOn 29 January 2024, the OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) announced that the organisation would not participate in international monitoring of election, citing the lack of an invitation from Russia.[129]\n\nOn 17 March 2024, the Chair of the Central Election Commission of the Russian Federation (CEC), Ella Pamfilova, announced that 1,115 international observers and experts from 129 countries were monitoring the electoral process.[130]\n\nResults\n\nSecond place by federal subject:\n\nKharitonov Davankov Slutsky\n\nOn 21 March, the CEC officially announced that Vladimir Putin had won the election, receiving 87.28% of all votes cast (including invalid ballots), followed by Nikolai Kharitonov with 4.31% of the vote, Vladislav Davankov with 3.85% and Leonid Slutsky with 3.20%.[119]\n\nResults by federal subject\n\nResults of Putin by federal subject.\n\nResults of Kharitonov by federal subject.\n\nResults of Davankov by federal subject.\n\nResults of Slutsky by federal subject.\n\nReactions\n\nDomestic\n\nOn 6 August 2023, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told The New York Times that \"our presidential election is not really democracy, it is costly bureaucracy. Mr. Putin will be re-elected next year with more than 90 percent of the vote\". Later he clarified that this was his personal opinion.[132] In an interview with the RBK news agency, Peskov said that Russia \"theoretically\" does not need to hold presidential elections because \"it's obvious that Putin will be reelected.\"[133]\n\nOn 6 November 2023, journalist Yekaterina Duntsova announced her intention to run for the presidency in the 2024 election; she said she would run as an independent candidate on an anti-war platform.[134] The next month, her nomination documents were rejected by the Central Election Commission.[135]\n\nIn November 2023, nationalist ex-militia commander Igor Girkin announced his intention to run as a candidate in the 2024 elections, describing elections in Russia as a \"sham\" in which \"the only winner [referring to Putin] is known in advance\".[136]\n\nIn January 2024, citing unidentified sources in the Kremlin, the independent news outlet Vyorstka reported that the CEC, at the behest of the Kremlin, will likely reject Boris Nadezhdin's registration due to his criticism of Putin and anti-war stances.[137] In late January 2024, a source in the Putin administration told the Latvia-based news outlet Meduza: \"There's a portion of the electorate that wants the war to end. If [Putin's opponent in the elections] decides to cater to this demand, they may get a decent percentage. And [the Putin administration] doesn't need that.\"[138] Russian state media intensified a smear campaign against Nadezhdin in the weeks leading up to the election. On 30 January 2024, Kremlin propagandist and television presenter Vladimir Solovyov warned Nadezhdin: \"I feel bad for Boris. The fool didn't realize that he's not being set up to run for president but for a criminal case on charges of betraying the Motherland.\"[138]\n\nFollowing the CEC's decision to ban him from running, Nadezhdin wrote in his Telegram channel: \"I do not agree with the decision of the CEC... Participating in the presidential election in 2024 is the most important political decision in my life. I am not backing down from my intentions.\"[139]\n\nPrior to the release of official results, former president and deputy head of the Security Council of Russia Dmitry Medvedev congratulated Putin on his \"splendid victory\".[140] After his victory was confirmed, Putin held a news conference on 18 March calling his win a vindication of his policy of defying the West and his decision to invade Ukraine.[4] He also described the result as an indication of \"trust\" and \"hope\" in him.[98] Exiled Russian dissident Leonid Volkov said that Putin's percentage of victory had \"not the slightest relation to reality\".[141]\n\nInternational\n\nIn an interview with TV3 on 4 March 2024, Latvian justice minister Inese L\u012bbi\u0146a-Egnere implied that Russians in the country who would participate in the election to be held in the Russian embassy in Riga could face criminal liability for justifying the invasion of Ukraine under Latvian law.[142] On 14 March, L\u012bbi\u0146a-Egnere appeared to have reversed her stance, stating that participation in the elections \"does not equate to supporting Putin\" and is \"not punishable in any way\"; she added that Latvia \"does not want to provoke an international row and intends to act like a democratic state\".[143] On 11 March, Armands Ruks, the head of the Latvian State Police announced that voters at the embassy would be subjected to police screenings before entering.[144]\n\nThe Russian ambassador to Moldova, Oleg Vasnetsov [ru], was summoned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Moldova on 12 March following Russia's decision to open six polling stations in Transnistria for the election, which Moldovan foreign minister Mihai Pop\u0219oi described as \"unacceptable\". The Moldovan government had previously agreed to open only one polling station in the Russian embassy in Chi\u0219in\u0103u as per international law as it claimed.[145] Russia's opening of polling stations in Transnistria was also condemned by Romania, the United States[146] and France.[147] On 19 March, Pop\u0219oi announced the expulsion of a Russian diplomat in response to the holding of elections in Transnistria.[148]\n\nThe Ukrainian foreign ministry called on international media and public figures \"to refrain from referring to this farce as 'elections' in the language of democratic states.\"[149] The United States condemned voting in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine, with State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller saying that the US would \"never recognize the legitimacy or outcome of these sham elections held in sovereign Ukraine\".[149] On 15 March, Ukraine's ambassador to the United Nations, Sergiy Kyslytsya, released a joint statement on behalf of Ukraine, the European Union and 56 other countries including the US condemning the holding of the elections in occupied parts of the country.[150] The Ukrainian government said it would not press charges against its residents of occupied areas who participate in the election, saying that they were being forced to vote.[151] The UN Security Council condemned the holding of the elections in occupied territories of Ukraine with deputy secretary-general Rosemary DiCarlo saying that \"holding elections in another UN member state's territory without its consent is in manifest disregard for the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity\" and were \"invalid\" under international law.[152]\n\nOn the first day of regular voting on 15 March, European Council president Charles Michel sarcastically congratulated Putin for winning a \"landslide victory\" in the elections starting that day, adding that there was \"No opposition. No freedom. No choice.\"[112] On 18 March, the European Union condemned \"the illegal holding of so-called elections' in the territories of Ukraine\" and said it would never recognise them. The EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell added that the election was held in the context of a shrinking political space.[153]\n\nFollowing the release of the results, Germany described the vote as a \"pseudo-election\" under an authoritarian ruler reliant on censorship, repression and violence.[154] The UK's Foreign Secretary, David Cameron condemned \"the illegal holding of elections on Ukrainian territory\",[154] adding that the vote was \"not what free and fair elections look like\". A spokesperson for the United States National Security Council described the election as \"obviously not free nor fair given how Mr. Putin has imprisoned political opponents and prevented others from running against him\",[4] but said that the US would recognize Putin as president.[155] In his evening address on 17 March, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described the election as an \"imitation\" with \"no legitimacy\", adding that Putin was \"addicted to power and does everything he can to rule forever\" and that \"There is no evil he will not commit to prolong his personal power.\"[156] Italian foreign minister Antonio Tajani described the election as \"neither free nor fair\", while Czech foreign minister Jan Lipavsk\u00fd called the election a \"farce and parody\".[157] Lithuanian foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis called the voting a \"procedure that is supposed to resemble elections\", adding that \"Some might call it reappointment, lacking any legitimacy.\"[158] The French foreign ministry said the \"conditions for a free, pluralist and democratic election were not met\", but praised \"the courage of the many Russian citizens who have peacefully demonstrated their opposition to this attack on their fundamental political rights.\"[159] South Korea refrained from commenting on the election and said that \"it would make considerations of 'appropriateness' in regard to a possible congratulatory cable to Putin.\"[160]\n\nLeaders of countries with neutral or friendly relations with Russia sent congratulations to Putin on his victory,[f] along with President of Republika Srpska Milorad Dodik, members of the Moldovan opposition, and Hamas political chairman Ismail Haniyeh.[206][207] Presidents Aslan Bzhania and Alan Gagloev, of the pro-Russian breakaway states of Abkhazia and South Ossetia respectively, also congratulated Putin.[208][209]\n\nProtests\n\nRussian immigrants outside the Russian embassy in Yerevan, Armenia as part of the \"Noon Against Putin\" event, 17 March 2024\n\nOn 1 February 2024, jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny and his allies called on supporters to protest Putin and the invasion of Ukraine on the last day of the election on 17 March all going to vote against Putin at the same time.[210] Following Navalny's death on 16 February, there were calls from Andrius Kubilius, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, and Navalny's widow, Yulia Navalnaya for the EU to recognize the Russian elections as illegitimate.[211][212][213] Navalnaya called for Russians critical of Putin to join the \"Noon Against Putin\" initiative to form long queues at polling stations at noon on 17 March before proceeding to vote for anyone other than Putin, spoil their ballots or cast Navalny's name.[214] On the day of the action, Navalnaya joined queues outside the Russian embassy in Berlin[215] for about six hours before casting her vote for her husband and praising protesters for giving her \"hope that everything is not in vain\".[154] In Russia, queues formed at polling stations in Moscow and Saint Petersburg at noon.[216] Queues were also observed outside Russian diplomatic missions worldwide, including in Belgrade, London, Podgorica, Tallinn, Paris and Milan.[114][154][217][218]\n\nIn response to the protests, authorities in Moscow threatened to prosecute participants under Article 141 of the Criminal Code of Russia, which prescribes five years' imprisonment for the obstruction of elections or citizens' electoral rights.[219] On 17 March, the Russian human rights group OVD-Info said that 80 people in 20 cities across Russia were arrested for election-related offences.[140] In response to the Noon Against Putin protests abroad, foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova described the queues outside Russian embassies as evidence of support for the Kremlin.[220]\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nMedia related to Russian presidential election, 2024 at Wikimedia Commons",

        "text": "RFK Jr in robust health despite brain worm scare, says campaign\nRFK Jr in robust health despite brain worm scare, says campaign\n\nEPA Robert F Kennedy Jr on the campaign trail in California\n\nThe New York Times reported that Mr Kennedy also previously suffered from mercury poisoning and heart problems.\n\nMr Kennedy has made health a key part of his campaign.\n\nHe has contrasted his physical fitness with that of Joe Biden and Donald Trump.\n\n\"Questioning Mr Kennedy's health is a hilarious suggestion, given his competition,\" his campaign said in a statement Wednesday.\n\n\"Mr Kennedy travelled extensively in Africa, South America, and Asia in his work as an environmental advocate, and in one of those locations contracted a parasite,\" the campaign said.\n\n\"The issue was resolved more than 10 years ago, and he is in robust physical and mental health.\"\n\nThe New York Times report, based on a divorce deposition, said that in 2010 Mr Kennedy experienced severe memory loss and brain fog.\n\nHe sought treatment and said in the deposition two years later that a doctor told him the issues could be \"caused by a worm that got into my brain and ate a portion of it and then died\".\n\nWorms do not eat brain tissue, experts say, but the idea is a non-medical or layman's understanding of what parasites might do if they enter the central nervous system.\n\nDr Philip Budge, an associate professor of infectious diseases at the Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis, said that parasite larvae can migrate to the brain and create cysts, in a condition known as neurocysticercosis.\n\n\"The cysts don't absorb any brain tissue, they simply create a space for the parasite to live,\" potentially pushing aside small parts of the brain, Dr Budge said.\n\n\"The cysts can occur in many places in the body. They usually don't cause any trouble unless they are in the brain,\" he said.\n\nAnd the effects of brain parasites depend on where they end up: \"It's like real estate: it's all about location location location.\"\n\n\"I'm unaware of any examples where a parasite affected cognition,\" said Dr Arnab Chatterjee, vice president of medicinal chemistry at the Center for Antiviral Medicines and Pandemic Preparedness in La Jolla, California.\n\nNeither Dr Budge nor Dr Chatterjee have treated Mr Kennedy or have any specific knowledge of his health history.\n\nHowever, Dr Chatterjee noted that another condition that RFK Jr reported suffering - mercury poisoning - does have a strong link to neurological problems.\n\nIn the deposition, Mr Kennedy also said he had elevated levels of mercury in his blood due to a diet heavy in tuna fish. He reduced his fish intake and underwent treatment for the condition.\n\nAfter a career as an environmental lawyer, Mr Kennedy rose to prominence as the head of anti-vaccine organisation Children's Health Defense, formerly known as the World Mercury Project.\n\nMr Kennedy, 70, frequently talks about health on the campaign trail and has tried to contrast himself with Mr Biden, 81, and Mr Trump, 77.\n\nHowever, the member of America's most famous political family has suffered from a variety of other health problems.\n\nX Last year Mr Kennedy posted a video of himself shirtless and doing push-ups\n\nHe is a former heroin addict and contracted hepatitis C from intravenous drug use, and has suffered from atrial fibrillation, a type of abnormal heartbeat.\n\nThe condition has put him in hospital at least four times, he told the New York Times, although he says has not had an episode for a decade.\n\nHe also has a noticeably strained, raspy voice caused by spasmodic dysphonia, a disorder that causes involuntary spasms in the muscles of the voice box.\n\nOn social media, he responded to the reports of his parasite by writing: \"I offer to eat 5 more brain worms and still beat President Trump and President Biden in a debate.\"",

        "text": "Home\nThe faculty of language is unique to humans and the study of language is the study of our shared human heritage. Linguistics is the scientific study of human language, its structure and its diversity, how children learn it and how adults produce and understand it, how social practices shape and are shaped by it.\n\nThe Department of Linguistics at the University of Colorado Boulder is a major center of interdisciplinary research in cognitive-functional linguistics, computational linguistics, language documentation, psycholinguistics and experimental linguistics, and sociocultural linguistics. It offers a range of research programs targeting properties of spoken language. The Department's orientation is empirical: its approach to the structure and use of language confronts theory with first-hand observations. Analysis of video and audio data (typically conversational data), acoustic measurements of speech, computational modeling and statistical analysis, psycholinguistic experimentation and fieldwork in local communities and abroad all contribute to this enterprise.\n\nThe Department of Linguistics Strategic Plan provides more detailed information about who we are, what we do, and our vision for the future.

        "text": "The federal government can do more about home costs than you think\nThe cost to buy a home has reached historic highs in the U.S. \u2014 the median price of a home is $420,800, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis \u2014 and housing and mortgage costs are increasingly turning into a November election issue.\n\nHome shoppers today need to an annual income of $114,000 in order to comfortably afford a typical home in the U.S., according to Redfin, nearly double what was needed to afford a typical home in 2020. That figure is far above the 2022 median household income of $74,580, according to the Census Bureau.\n\nHigher monthly payments are driven by higher home prices as well as significantly higher interest rates. Mortgage interest rates, which dipped to an historic low of 2.65% on a 30-year fixed mortgage in 2021, have soared beyond 7%, higher than they've been since 2001. Interest rates are set by the independent Federal Reserve, and President Joe Biden has insisted on the Fed's independence. The Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates since 2021 in order to combat stubborn inflation.\n\nSo what tools does the federal government have at its disposal to make home ownership more affordable? Here are things the Biden administration and Congress could consider, according to experts who study the issue.\n\nProvide tax benefits for builders who produce entry-level homes\n\nThere should be an effort to increase the housing stock, particularly of smaller, entry-level homes, several experts agree.\n\nOnce interest rates are removed from the picture, \"then you're left focusing mainly on the supply shortfall,\" said Jim Parrott, fellow at the Urban Institute and former Obama White House economic adviser.\n\nThe housing market has seen a severe shortage of smaller starter homes, Parrott said. Builders, he said, are incentivized to build large, often mansion-like homes, which more easily turn a profit.\n\n\"The cost of building larger homes tends to be quite high, and it's easier to recoup those costs if you're making big, expensive homes,\" Parrott said.\n\nThe federal government needs to \"make the math for building homes at the bottom of the market more favorable\" for developers, Parrott suggested. And Congress can do this with the tax code. One approach would be to give a tax cut to any builder who constructs a residence for a first-time home buyer at below the median home price, Parrott said.\n\n\"You need to provide some sort of tax benefit for building homes in the parts of the market where we need them the most,\" Parrott said.\n\nBut getting this divided Congress to work together on something like this would be challenging, Parrott said.\n\n\"I'm afraid that the legislative environment right now just isn't conducive to this sort of big, bipartisan effort,\" Parrott said. \"Hopefully after the election we'll see a reboot that provides a more hopeful window.\"\n\nWithhold funding from localities that don't change zoning laws\n\nMost of the control over zoning lies with state and local governments. And states have been working to overhaul zoning to ease restrictions on denser residential construction. But the federal government isn't entirely powerless on zoning.\n\nParrott said the federal government has used a carrot approach to encourage localities to rezone in favor of denser housing, but now he thinks maybe it's time to use a stick. For instance, any federal funding for communities could be conditioned on how zoning decisions are made. Communities receive substantial financial support from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Transportation Department and other agencies for projects, Parrott noted.\n\n\"If federal policymakers were to condition even a little bit some of that funding on whether or not local decision-making is supportive of or prohibitive of more density,...then you could begin to change things at the local level in a way that would really matter,\" Parrott said.\n\nSuch a move would be almost certain to trigger strict opposition from localities and unions. But more states have already been enacting legislation to supersede local zoning rules, said Alex Horowitz, director of housing policy at The Pew Charitable Trusts. Horowitz said nine states have passed laws allowing accessible dwelling units or ADUs \u2014 like small, independent, mother-in-law suites \u2014 on homeowners' properties.\n\nSell federal land to use for housing\n\n\"The federal government owns hundreds and hundreds of millions of acres, and we're not talking about the National Parks here,\" said Edward Pinto, co-director of the American Enterprise Institute's Housing Center.\n\nBut that's a proposal that Congress would need to authorize.\n\nIt has been tried. Sen. Mike Lee's HOUSES Act of 2022 would have approved the sale of federal land to states and localities for below-market rates for housing projects. The federal government owns two-thirds of the land in Lee's home state of Utah, and the gap between median household income and median home cost is largest in the West, according to HUD.\n\nBut his bill went nowhere. The Bureau of Land Management, which oversees federal land, said in written Senate testimony that it would be forced to \"sell land without sufficient evaluation of the values to the public or to future generations, or sufficient compensation to the American taxpayer.\"\n\nThe sale of unused land could also attract opposition from environmentalist groups, though sometimes that can be overcome. In March, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee signed a law that will allow that state's Department of Natural Resources (DNR) to transfer some of its property to localities to build affordable housing.\n\nWashington state GOP Rep. April Connors, who introduced the bill, noted that that the DNR had 7,000 acres of land that was unusable for timber harvesting because it was too close to developed land. Building housing on it could ease the shortage of homes in Washington, Connors noted in a statement, pointing out that the state has the \"fewest housing units per household in the nation and nearly half of renters spend a third of their income on rent.\"\n\nImprove consumer access to financing for manufactured housing\n\nManufactured homes are factory-built residences built after 1976 \u2014 formerly known as mobile homes \u2014 that can be placed on land. The average new manufactured home sold for $126,600 in November 2023, according to the Census Bureau.\n\nBut loans are harder for homebuyers to secure for manufactured homes than for traditional ones, Horowitz said. And since manufactured housing usually involves shipping over state lines, the federal government plays a big role. HUD controls access to financing for manufactured homes, and rules are stricter than they are for traditional homes.\n\nInterest rates are typically also higher for manufactured home loans than for traditional home loans, in part because unlike traditional homes, which tend to appreciate in value over time, manufactured homes can depreciate. The structures are also viewed as riskier than conventional homes because they're usually harder to sell on the market. Horowitz suggests HUD could make it easier for borrowers to access loans.\n\nEliminate tax breaks for second (and third) homes\n\nCongress could increase the national housing stock over time by eliminating tax breaks for any homes that aren't a primary residence, said AEI's Pinto.\n\nGetting rid of the mortgage interest rate deduction for non-primary residences would eventually encourage many homeowners to sell, Pinto said.\n\n\"Why should they be subsidized by the tax code,\" Pinto asked.\n\nWithout that tax break, hundreds of thousands of homes would come back onto the market as primary residences, Pinto said.\n\n\"It would cost the federal government basically nothing,\" Pinto said. \"They'd actually save some money on the tax savings, and it would not increase demand at all.\"\n\nThis isn't likely to happen soon though. Such a measure would have to be passed by Congress \u2014 and many lawmakers own second and third residences. And a number of their constituents and donors own multiple homes. Realtor interest groups would oppose it, too, Pinto said.\n\nThe most Congress has done in recent years to address tax breaks for expensive residences was in 2017, when the GOP-controlled Congress capped the deduction limit for state and local income taxes, which hit coastal, heavily Democratic states like New York and California particularly hard.\n\nStill, eliminating the tax break for secondary homes is \"low-hanging fruit,\" and would increase supply and reduce demand simultaneously, Pinto said.\n\nLowering interest rates probably wouldn't lower housing costs\n\nEconomists mostly doubt that action by the Federal Reserve to significantly lower interest rates would help much.\n\n\"If the Fed were to cut rates in a way that allowed mortgage rates to fall to the 4% range, we would see both supply and demand increase in the housing market,\" said Chen Zhao, who leads the economics team at Redfin.\n\nAnd whether home prices rise or fall would depend on what then happens to housing supply and demand.\n\n\"If demand increases more, then prices would grow at a faster rate than they are currently,\" Zhao said. \"However, it's also possible that supply would increase more because sellers have been so locked in by low existing mortgage rates. If that's the case, then price growth could fall. I think it's unlikely in either case that prices would fall outright.\"\n\nWould Biden or Trump's policies help or hurt housing costs?\n\nFormer President Donald Trump hasn't offered policy suggestions to address housing affordability yet, although he criticizes mortgage interest rates and home prices under President Biden.\n\nThe president has proposed giving a $10,000 tax credit to first-time middle class homebuyers, and up to $25,000 to first generation home buyers. He's also introducing a $20 billion fund that in addition to helping build affordable rental units, is meant to peel away local barriers to housing development and spur the construction of starter homes.\n\nDown payment assistance may help home shoppers in the near term, although the tax credit probably falls short of the traditional 20% down payment on most homes. With monthly payments at record highs, this down payment assistance would not lower monthly costs. And down payment assistance could have unintended consequences, Pinto said: \"It would increase the price of entry level homes.\"\n\nThe effect down payment assistance or a buyer tax credit would have on the housing market is complicated in a supply-constrained market, Horowitz said.\n\nWhile Trump hasn't made specific proposals on housing, his proposals in other policy areas would likely drive home prices up, Parrott said. Mass deportations of undocumented migrants, for instance, could drive the cost of labor higher, and raising tariffs on China could drive up material costs, Parrott said.\n\n\"The things that Trump has said relevant to housing almost all cut the wrong way,\" Parrot said.\n\nHow home costs could affect the election\n\nThe cost of home ownership is a top concern for Democrats and Republicans, city dwellers and rural residents alike, said Parrott. Once an issue has broken through the barriers of red and blue, metro and rural, \"then it changes the probability of something happening,\" Parrott said.\n\n\"Housing has found its way to the grownups table, in effect, for the first time,\" Parrott said.\n\nAnd even though it's the Fed that controls interest rates, Mr. Biden could be held accountable by voters.\n\n\"President Biden's reelection is closely tied to the cost of homeownership and thus, the fixed mortgage rates,\" Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics predicted. \"The fixed rate is currently just over 7%. If it rises above 8% for any length of time, his reelection odds will fade, and if it falls closer to 6% his odds will increase meaningfully, all else equal.\"",

U.S. Presidential Scholars demonstrate exceptional talent in career and technical education (CTE) fields, in the visual, creative, and performing arts, or on academic assessments. Today, ED announced that five Washington students have earned the distinction. The Scholars are: Ashwin Joshi, Southridge High School, Kennewick School District Lexi J.

I look forward to their success in the careers and pathways that they choose.\u201d Up to 161 students are selected for the honor each year. As directed by Presidential Executive Order, the 2024 U.S. Presidential Scholars are comprised of two students from each state, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, as well as U.S. students living abroad. The recognition is also extended to 15 scholars chosen at-large, 20 scholars in the arts, and 20 scholars in CTE. Of the more than 3.7 million students expected to graduate from high school this year, more than 5,700 qualified for the 2024 awards. There are three paths for selection as a candidate for the award: General program: Candidates are selected based on outstanding performance on the SAT or ACT exams. Arts program: Candidates must participate in YoungArts, a national program identifying and recognizing young people demonstrating excellence in visual arts, performing arts, and creative writing. YoungArts nominates students who meet the U.S. Presidential Scholars candidacy requirements. CTE program: Candidates are selected based on their accomplishments in CTE fields. Chief state school officers nominate students who meet the candidacy requirements. Once selected as candidates, students complete essays and self-assessments, as well as submit school evaluations and transcripts. A review committee, comprised of experts in secondary and postsecondary education, evaluates candidates on their academic achievement, personal characteristics, leadership and service activities, and an analysis of their essay. The White House Commission on Presidential Scholars then selects the students who will receive the award. Scholars are invited to name a teacher they consider to be the most influential in their knowledge, skills, and impact on the school community. These teachers are recognized as Distinguished Teachers as part of the U.S. Presidential Scholars Program. The teachers that Washington\u2019s awarded students selected are: Valentina Craciunoiu, Bellevue Senior High School, Bellevue School District (Nominating Scholar: Kosha Upadhyay) Heather Gallagher, Goldendale High School, Goldendale School District (Nominating Scholar: Lexi J.

They look ahead to potential areas of vulnerability in the run-up to the 2024 election, and identify ways to strengthen our democratic processes in response. This program was streamed live on March 21, 2024, as part of our America\u2019s Town Hall series.\n\nPlease subscribe to We the People and Live at the National Constitution Center on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or your favorite podcast app.\n\nThis episode was produced by Lana Ulrich, Bill Pollock, and Tanaya Tauber. It was engineered by David Stotz and Bill Pollock. Research was provided by Samson Mostashari, Cooper Smith, and Yara Daraiseh.\n\nParticipants\n\nRichard Hasen is professor of law and political science at the University of California, Los Angeles, School of Law, where he directs UCLA Law\u2019s Safeguarding Democracy Project. An internationally recognized expert in election law, he served in election law analyst for CNN in 2020 and NBC News/MSNBC in 2022. Hasen also writes the Election Law Blog. His books include Cheap Speech, Election Meltdown, The Voting Wars, and his most recently A Real Right to Vote: How a Constitutional Amendment Can Safeguard American Democracy.\n\nSarah Isgur is senior editor of The Dispatch, hosts the legal podcast Advisory Opinions, and frequently appears as a legal analyst on cable news. Prior to joining The Dispatch, Isgur served in the Justice Department as the director of the Office of Public Affairs, as senior counsel to the deputy attorney general, and on three presidential campaigns.\n\nLawrence Lessig is the Roy L. Furman Professor of Law and Leadership at Harvard Law School, a 2016 presidential candidate, and founder of Equal Citizens. He is the author of several books, including They Don\u2019t Represent Us: Reclaiming Our Democracy, Fidelity & Constraint: How the Supreme Court Has Read the American Constitution, America, Compromised, among many others. And his most recent book (with Matthew Seligman) is How to Steal a Presidential Election.\n\nJeffrey Rosen is the president and CEO of the National Constitution Center, a nonpartisan nonprofit organization devoted to educating the public about the U.S. Constitution. Rosen is also a professor of law at The George Washington University Law School and a contributing editor of The Atlantic.\n\nAdditional Resources:\n\nExcerpt from Interview: Sarah Isgur discusses the complexity of addressing voting litigation, highlights the ideological and institutional axes within the Supreme Court, and suggests that the maximalist approach in Trump v. Anderson was driven by a desire to preempt potential challenges to the political process.\n\nSarah Isgur: I think, though, that Rick would acknowledge you can't fix everything. You can't end all voting litigation because a lot of the problems, again, going back to 2020, but really every election have to do with mail in ballots. Last time, what was it? There was a date by which the ballot had to be received, but what about the ones that were undated, but they were received by the right time, just like silly stuff like that, that you're not gonna have a constitutional amendment to fix all of that stuff. Of course, it's a great irony. I was a former Republican campaign operative. I've worked in many of these sort of pre-recount situations of ballot misprints and everything else. I've been on the ground, my job in 2012 for the Romney campaign was election operations, which was preparing for a recount that didn't happen.\n\nBut one of the things that you're most focused on is thinking through all of the different things that can go wrong and trying to fix them ahead of time. So in some sense, I think the campaigns are both on board with trying to minimize the litigation. Because it's a huge waste of their resources during the campaign in advance. To move to Trump v. Anderson, and this gets to my overall thesis about why the court is in 6-3 and why it's better thought of as a 3-3-3 court, that you have this axis on the bottom. It's an x-axis. It's the ideological one that you're all very familiar with, conservative to liberal, although boy, we might be stopping thinking about that as a linear spectrum and more a scattered chart at this point. We seem to have three, if not seven different parties going on right now that don't fall, I think, very neatly along that.\n\nBut let's just put it on that for now. But then there's this other spectrum that's very specific to the Supreme Court on institutionalism. And I think there's different things that fall into that spectrum. I don't have a single definition of it, but institutionalism in general is going to care about how easy something is to follow for the lower courts or for the country for that matter, how much it settles an issue, how much it helps or hurts the credibility of the court moving forward. The consequences of it. Does it result in chaos or does it result in sort of the orderly administration of justice? And boy, do I think the Trump v. Anderson case, and this is whether Colorado as a state had the ability to disqualify Donald Trump under the Section 3 of the 14th Amendment Insurrection Clause, there was a lot of institutionalism going on there.\n\nWhat's interesting is that that cut against what you normally see from institutionalist judges, justices. Which is minimalism, judicial minimalism, something that the chief justice cares a great deal about. Only deciding as many decisions as you can, because that's how you get the most number of people to agree to it. That's how it sort of has the least amount of impact on the institution and the credibility and all those things I mentioned. Except in this case, because the narrowest version of a Trump v. Anderson decision would have just said Colorado can't do it. It's what the four actually were advocating for, including Justice Amy Coney Barrett. And she even said, I would have just gone with the minimalist decision here.\n\nBut I think the reason that the five went with the more maximalist decision, deciding things that they didn't have to decide, technically speaking, was because they were not going to do it. In this case, the institution was better protected by ruling out some of the nonsense that was clearly gonna come down the pike if they didn't do that. The reason I bring that up is really to tell you where I think the Supreme Court sees this. They're very concerned about what happens next. They absolutely believe that this election will end up in their hands. They don't want it to. They think that will hurt the institution greatly. And they do care about the credibility of the court. And in over-deciding Trump v. Anderson, I think you can tell how open they are to sort of nonsense, what they view as nonsense challenges to what should be left of the political process.\n\nExcerpt from Interview: Larry Lessig discusses the narrow interpretation of Section 3 enforcement, highlights concerns about potential threats to election officials' autonomy, proposing modifications to prevent the loss of electoral votes in case of a candidate's death before Electors' Day.\n\nLarry Lessig: I think the important thing about how they've narrowed it, I think they've said, and I think people have misread what they've said, they've said that if you're gonna enforce Section 3, you're gonna need to do it through a statute that Congress has passed for federal officers. There is such a statute. 2383 is a statute that could have been invoked by Jack Smith, and he could have prosecuted under it. If you listen to the lawyers for Colorado, it was such a simple case. It sounds like it would have been a one-day trial and he would have been convicted. And had he been convicted under Trump v. Anderson, he would not be a candidate. But obviously, Jack Smith didn't think it was an easy case. And so therefore, he wasn't prosecuted under that provision. And I think all of us should stand back and say, if you don't think you can prove that he actually committed insurrection in a criminal sense.\n\nWhy do we think we ought to be allowing him to be kicked off of the ballot? I know everybody says this is just a qualification, but it's not just a qualification. It's a qualification that speaks to his culpability for a criminal, what is in essence a criminal Act. And I think like narrowing it to that is really important. But I do think it's really, I hadn't seen the essay that Rick pointed to. I'm really heartened to see Democrats are saying that they're not going to take up disqualification. But this is a reason why it's important to unpack what the rules actually are, because I don't think under the Electoral Count Reform Act, you're allowed to consider disqualification. Or age or any other qualification for deciding whether to count a state's electoral vote.\n\nBecause what the law says is that Congress can refuse to count a vote if it's not regularly given, meaning given by the electors and not regularly given by the electors. And what they were pointing to or imagining is somebody being coerced or bribed to give a vote one way or the other. And so you look at the process for the vote, and you say there's something wrong with the vote. I don't think that reaches, though there's slight legislative history to the contrary, it has no basis, I think, in the language of vote not regularly given. There's any basis for anything other than a charge about how the electoral votes were cast, and this points to Congress as a failed institution for enforcing its laws, because in 2020, when Josh Hawley tried to rally Congress to throw out Pennsylvania's votes, he completely violated the basis of the Electoral Count Act that was enforced then.\n\nBecause then again, the only basis for throwing out Pennsylvania's votes was that the votes of the electors were not properly given. But obviously, the votes of the Biden electors in Pennsylvania were properly given. They were Biden electors and they all voted for Biden. There was no question that they had been forced to vote one way or the other. So there was no legal basis for his objection. Yet he and 146 other members of Congress objected to the counting of Pennsylvania's ballots, which means he either doesn't know the law, which as a former law professor seems unlikely, or he doesn't care what the law is. And that's the real concern, that people will act contrary to what the law actually says and just do what they wanna do and do it in a way that creates this opportunity. To be clear, I didn't argue in 2020 anybody should vote contrary to how they were pledged.\n\n...\n\nAnd so while we were very proud of the electoral, election officials who stood up and did the right thing in 2020. I'm really anxious about them standing up and doing the right thing if they're being threatened by thousands of people at their house demanding that they would vote one way or the other. So I would like to lock them in. But there's a really important loophole here that we've gotta close. If the president dies or the candidate who wins the popular election dies between Election Day and Electors' Day. And the standard binding statute is in effect, which basically says you have to vote for the guy who won the popular election. Then a bunch of those electoral votes could be lost. They just couldn't be cast. This issue was actually raised with Horace Greeley in 1872, who died between the election and Electors' Day. 63 of those electors shifted sides, and three of them continued to vote for Horace Greeley. So these statutes need to be modified to make sure that if, in fact, the candidate doesn't survive to Electors' Day, and given these two candidates, it's not an improbable thing to worry about, we've got to make sure that we don't throw away electoral votes because that too would throw the integrity of the system into doubt.\n\nExcerpt from Interview: Rick Hasen expresses concern about public acceptance of election results, potential violence, and the legal loopholes surrounding the Electoral Count Act.\n\nRick Hasen: Well, first, let me say it's great to be with you again at the National Constitution Center and glad to be with Sarah and with Larry having this discussion with all of you. Obviously, even if we got a constitutional amendment, I see this as a multi-year project. Nothing's going to happen before January 6th 2025. So the world we're living in, I mean, the first thing I would say is putting aside all of the legal machinations, which Larry covers in his book, I'm worried about the potential for violence. I'm worried about people not believing the results of the election because this is what we saw in 2020. You mentioned my earlier book, Cheap Speech, where I talk about how it's become so much easier to share false information about elections being stolen or rigged. We now have millions and millions of people who believe the last election was stolen or rigged, despite all the reliable evidence.\n\nTo the contrary, democracy depends upon the people who are on the losing end, agreeing that the election was fair and square and agreeing to fight fairly the next time. So I am worried about public acceptance of results. I'm worried about the potential for violence against election officials, against poll workers, against voters. We're in a very volatile and polarized moment in our history. I hope that cooler heads will prevail and that, we'll be able to get through this period. But even before we get to Congress's counting of the electoral college votes on January 6th, there's a lot that has to happen that a lot that has to go right. And there's a big part of civil society that needs to make sure it goes right. Let let me say one thing about a hole that is left open regarding January 6th 2025, a legal hole.\n\nSome of the things that I know Larry had been worrying about and Matt for a long time involved manipulation of a old law back from the 1870s called the Electoral Count Act. Congress fixed some of the problems with that act when it passed the Electoral Count Reform Act in December of 2022. There was also this very broad theory called the Independent State Legislature Theory. There was an extreme version of it that would've let state legislatures potentially put in an alternative slate of electors. The Supreme Court seemed to shut that down in a case called Moore v. Harper that decided last term, but in a case called Trump v. Anderson, which the Supreme Court just decided weeks ago, the court left open the possibility that Congress could potentially try to disqualify an apparently winning candidate from having his or her electoral votes counted on grounds that the person participated in an insurrection and is therefore disqualified under section three of the 14th Amendment. The Trump v. Anderson case involved whether states could disqualify candidates in this case disqualify Trump, but left open in a very kind of unclear way what Congress might be able to do and when they might be able to do it. So that's another scenario in addition to all the ones that Larry lays out that I worry about in terms of legal challenges to the results in 2025.\n\nFull Transcript\n\n\n\nView Transcript (PDF)\n\nThis transcript may not be in its final form, accuracy may vary, and it may be updated or revised in the future.\n\nStay Connected and Learn More\n\nContinue the conversation by following us on social media @ConstitutionCtr.\n\nSign up to receive Constitution Weekly, our email roundup of constitutional news and debate.\n\nSubscribe, rate, and review wherever you listen.\n\nJoin us for an upcoming live program or watch recordings on YouTube.\n\nSupport our important work.\n\nDonate",

        "text": "RFK Jr in robust health despite brain worm scare, says campaign\nUS presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr says he is in \"robust health\" following reports that he suffered from a brain parasite more than a decade ago.\n\nThe New York Times reported that Mr Kennedy also previously suffered from mercury poisoning and heart problems.\n\nMr Kennedy has made health a key part of his campaign.\n\nHe has contrasted his physical fitness with that of Joe Biden and Donald Trump.\n\n\"Questioning Mr Kennedy's health is a hilarious suggestion, given his competition,\" his campaign said in a statement Wednesday.\n\n\"Mr Kennedy travelled extensively in Africa, South America, and Asia in his work as an environmental advocate, and in one of those locations contracted a parasite,\" the campaign said.\n\n\"The issue was resolved more than 10 years ago, and he is in robust physical and mental health.\"\n\nThe New York Times report, based on a divorce deposition, said that in 2010 Mr Kennedy experienced severe memory loss and brain fog.\n\nHe sought treatment and said in the deposition two years later that a doctor told him the issues could be \"caused by a worm that got into my brain and ate a portion of it and then died\".\n\nWorms do not eat brain tissue, experts say, but the idea is a non-medical or layman's understanding of what parasites might do if they enter the central nervous system.\n\nDr Philip Budge, an associate professor of infectious diseases at the Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis, said that parasite larvae can migrate to the brain and create cysts, in a condition known as neurocysticercosis.\n\n\"The cysts don't absorb any brain tissue, they simply create a space for the parasite to live,\" potentially pushing aside small parts of the brain, Dr Budge said.\n\n\"The cysts can occur in many places in the body. They usually don't cause any trouble unless they are in the brain,\" he said.\n\nAnd the effects of brain parasites depend on where they end up: \"It's like real estate: it's all about location location location.\"\n\n\"I'm unaware of any examples where a parasite affected cognition,\" said Dr Arnab Chatterjee, vice president of medicinal chemistry at the Center for Antiviral Medicines and Pandemic Preparedness in La Jolla, California.\n\nNeither Dr Budge nor Dr Chatterjee have treated Mr Kennedy or have any specific knowledge of his health history.\n\nHowever, Dr Chatterjee noted that another condition that RFK Jr reported suffering - mercury poisoning - does have a strong link to neurological problems.\n\nIn the deposition, Mr Kennedy also said he had elevated levels of mercury in his blood due to a diet heavy in tuna fish. He reduced his fish intake and underwent treatment for the condition.\n\nAfter a career as an environmental lawyer, Mr Kennedy rose to prominence as the head of anti-vaccine organisation Children's Health Defense, formerly known as the World Mercury Project.\n\nMr Kennedy, 70, frequently talks about health on the campaign trail and has tried to contrast himself with Mr Biden, 81, and Mr Trump, 77.\n\nHowever, the member of America's most famous political family has suffered from a variety of other health problems.",

        "text": "Biden campaign ramps up outreach to Black voters in Wisconsin as some organizers worry about turnout\nRacine, Wisconsin \u2014 Sheree Robinson was excited about being invited to ride in President Joe Biden's motorcade during his trip to Wisconsin Wednesday. The Black mother of two and longtime resident of Racine said education funding in Mr. Biden's American Rescue Plan enabled her to earn a HSED, a High School Equivalency Diploma.\n\n\"Our conversation was just so natural,\" she said of the president. \"He definitely has my vote, and I will talk to everyone else and let them know he needs their vote, too.\"\n\nAsked if she thought he'd win this November, Robinson replied, \"Why wouldn't he?\"\n\nMr. Biden has a head start on former President Donald Trump in outreach and organizing support with Black communities. As part of a $14 million ad buy announced on Tuesday, the Biden campaign said there would be a seven-figure investment on ad buys in Black, Hispanic and AAPI media. The campaign says it will also have 46 offices across the battleground state, with headquarters in Milwaukee, a city where 39% of the population is Black according to the U.S. Census.\n\nThe Black vote is a crucial bloc of Mr. Biden's support, and national polling has shown a slight but nonetheless significant decline in enthusiasm. A 2020 CBS News national exit poll showed that 87% of Black voters supported Mr. Biden. A Washington Post-Ipsos poll from April showed a decrease in Black voters who said they're \"absolutely certain to vote,\" dropping from 74% in June 2020 to 62% in April.\n\nAnd the race in the state is tight. A CBS News April poll of Wisconsin found that 50% of likely voters supported Mr. Trump, while 49% support Mr. Biden. Turnout in Milwaukee decreased slightly from 2016 to 2020, according to local news outlet Wisconsin Watch.\n\n\"Even if only 85% of Black voters instead of 90% vote for Biden, additional turnout helps Democrats,\" said Barry Burden, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \"Concern No. 1 is just whether he will get a smaller share of the Black vote than he did last time around.\"\n\nAfter he announced a $3.3 billion investment by Microsoft for a new data center in Racine County, Mr. Biden visited the Dr. John Bryant Community Center on Wednesday to meet with a room full of Black Wisconsin voters and volunteers who were being trained on using a voter outreach app.\n\nIn a memo, the campaign said the event is the first in a series of engagements the campaign has booked in May \"that focus on deepening our organizing presence with the core constituencies that will be critical in this election.\"\n\n\"When I run in [my home state of] Delaware \u2014 not a joke \u2014 I get 90% of the African-American vote in off years and [presidential election] years, because you're the most loyal constituency,\" he told the crowd.\n\nUS President Joe Biden takes a picture with supporters as he meets with campaign volunteers at Dr. John Bryant Community Center in Racine, Wisconsin, on May 8, 2024. MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images\n\nAt that stop, Andrea Dyess talked with Mr. Biden about her battle with cancer 14 years ago, and how the healthcare costs nearly bankrupted her. She praised the Affordable Care Act and also said democracy was a key issue for her vote this November.\n\nShe let out a sigh when asked what she thought about Mr. Biden's chances this November.\n\n\"Wisconsin is a hard state. But we're going to make it blue,\" she said, adding that her community in Racine has shown \"strong\" support for Mr. Biden.\n\nJanet Mitchell, a 77-year-old Black voter in Racine, felt that voters her age would be voting for Mr. Biden but worried the response to Israeli strikes in Gaza could alienate younger voters.\n\n\"I think what's going on in Israel has taken their eyes off what was supposedly going to be an easy race for Biden,\" Mitchell said of younger voters. \"It's going to take all of us to get Biden back in office again.\"\n\nWhile the Republican National Convention is going to be held in Milwaukee this summer, the Trump campaign has not yet said whether it has any field offices in the state, or what its plans are for outreach to Black voters.\n\nUS President Joe Biden hugs a campaign volunteer at Dr. John Bryant Community Center in Racine, Wisconsin, on May 8, 2024. MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images\n\nAs the Biden campaign ramps up its Black voter outreach, 34 miles north, in Franklin Heights, a neighborhood in northwest Milwaukee, members of the nonprofit \"Black Leaders Organizing Communities\" say they've run into apathetic voters who feel the president hasn't done enough on the economy, education and police reform.\n\n\"Biden ain't doing what we asked him to do\u2026 he needs to show us more,\" said Antonio Hampton, a 45-year-old member of Black Leaders Organizing Communities (BLOC). \"We're fighting for him to show us more, we want him there. Because we don't want Trump in.\"\n\n\"When we're out here canvassing, talking to people, they say 'my vote don't count.' Because when they do go out and vote\u2026 nothing's changed for them,\" said 43 year-old BLOC member Broshea Jackson. \"Our job is to educate them and make them understand why their vote is so valuable.\"\n\nTamer Malone, a 26-year-old who worked with BLOC to support Biden during the 2020 election, felt that his term has been \"disappointing\" on education and on police reform, but said local government officials share some of the blame, too.\n\nShe added that some Black voters in her community have been leaning toward Trump because of the stimulus checks they received at the peak of COVID-19 \u2013 though Malone notes that \"was going to be distributed anyways, because it was a pandemic.\"\n\n\"They're kind of neck and neck right now,\" she said of Biden and Trump in the state. \"Biden to me is ahead by a hair [in Wisconsin]. And that hair is the Black and Brown community. He just needs to step up. There's so little time to turn around our community and make us feel like he's worth our vote and voice.\"",

        "text": "Mahamat D\u00e9by wins Chad presidential election\nChad's military ruler wins presidential poll\n\nMahamat D\u00e9by succeeds his father who was in power for three decades\n\nGen D\u00e9by, 40, was installed as Chad's leader by the military after his father, Idriss D\u00e9by Itno, was killed during a battle with rebel forces in April 2021.\n\nMr Masra had earlier declared that he had won a \"resounding victory\" in the first round of voting, and that victory had been stolen \"from the people\".\n\nGen D\u00e9by won 61.3% of the vote, according to the state's election body, citing provisional results, while his closest rival, Prime Minister Succes Masra, won 18.53%.\n\nChad's military ruler Mahamat D\u00e9by has been declared the official winner of the presidential elections, legitimising his grip on power.\n\nHis victory means that the D\u00e9by family's 34-year-rule will continue.\n\nAfter the results were announced, supporters of the ruling coalition stormed the streets of N\u2019Djamena to celebrate Gen D\u00e9by\u2019s victory.\n\nIn his victory speech posted on social media, he promised to serve all Chadians - \u201cthose who voted for me and president for those who made other choices\u201d.\n\n\u201cI have a special thought for the unfortunate candidates who have lost the competition.\u201d\n\nJust before the election results were announced, Prime Minister Masra claimed victory in a live broadcast on Facebook, and called on his supporters and security forces to oppose what he said was an attempt by Gen D\u00e9by to \"steal the victory from the people\".\n\n\"A small number of individuals believe they can make people believe that the election was won by the same system that has been ruling Chad for decades,\" he said.\n\n\"To all Chadians who voted for change, who voted for me, I say: mobilise. Do it calmly, with a spirit of peace,\" he added.\n\nThe results of Monday's election were announced two weeks earlier than expected.\n\nThey still have to be confirmed by the Constitutional Council.\n\nChad becomes the first of the countries where the military seized power in West and Central Africa in recent years to hold elections and restore civilian rule.\n\nBut critics say with the election of Gen D\u00e9by, little has changed.\n\nMonday's voting was mostly peaceful but at least one voter was killed, according to local media.\n\nThere had also been some opposition reports of irregularities on polling day.\n\nTen politicians who had been hoping to run were excluded by the constitutional council because of \u201cirregularities\u201d, which some say was politically motivated.\n\nAnother potential opponent, and a cousin of Gen D\u00e9by, Yaya Dillo, was killed by security forces in February while allegedly leading an attack on the National Security Agency in the capital, N\u2019Djamena.\n\nActivists had called for a boycott of the election.\n\nMany are still in exile following a deadly crackdown on opponents following protests in October 2022.\n\nThe oil-exporting country of nearly 18 million people has not had a free-and-fair transfer of power since independence from France in 1960.\n\nIdriss D\u00e9by overthrew Hiss\u00e8ne Habr\u00e9 in 1990 and remained in charge for the following three decades until his battlefield death in April 2021 at the age of 68.\n\nGen D\u00e9by initially pledged to stay as interim leader for just 18 months, a period that was later extended. He also said that he would not run for president.",

        "text": "Election 2024: Where the Presidential Race Stands With Six Months to Go\nElection Day is now less than six months away. In some states, voting begins in just over four months. So where do things stand?\n\nFor all the sturm und drang of the past year on the election front\u2014and the countless news analyses, articles, op-eds, interviews, speeches, and blog posts\u2014little has changed in the basic structure of the presidential race. Joe Biden and Donald Trump continue to run neck-in-neck in the national polls, while the outcome will likely be decided by what happens in seven battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. How those races break will depend on whose voters turn out and whose stay home.\n\nBiden is seeking to turn out his voters by stressing how he has delivered for them while simultaneously reminding them why they sent Trump packing four years ago. Biden\u2019s problem is that many voters say they are worse off now than they were four years ago, even if economic statistics show the opposite. Compounding the problem is that voters appear to know little about the legislative achievements that Biden is trumpeting. Meanwhile, many Americans look more kindly on Trump\u2019s presidency than they did in 2020, a reassessment no doubt aided by Trump\u2019s success in delaying three of his four criminal trials from starting.\n\nThe Water's Edge James M.

The crisis at the southern border leads Trump\u2019s critique, joined by complaints that the economy is a \u201ccesspool\u201d that is unleashing \u201crecord horrible inflation\u201d reminiscent of Weimar Germany. But Trump is also hammering Biden for mishandling Ukraine, Gaza, Afghanistan, and a range of other foreign policy crises. He won\u2019t be doing so because these issues matter to large numbers of voters\u2014polls continue to show that foreign policy falls way down the list of issues that worry the public\u2014but because they fuel his narrative that Biden is not up for the job.\n\nThe two wild cards in all this\u2014besides events, which can always upend a race\u2014are abortion and third-party candidates. Democrats have outperformed in a range of a congressional and state races ever since the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade, often in ways that outpaced what pre-race polls predicted. Democrats hope that trend will be repeated on November 5.\n\nThe other wild card is third-party candidates. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Jill Stein, and Cornel West are not going to win the Electoral College. They could, however, determine who does. Kennedy has the greatest potential to tilt the election outcome given his name recognition and surprising strength in the national polls. But so far, he has made the ballot in just one state where the race is likely to be close\u2014Michigan\u2014though that could and likely will change before voters go to the poll. The question that keeps the Biden and Trump campaigns up at night is who Kennedy is most likely to take votes from.\n\nDoes this mean that the election will invariably be a photo finish? No, undecideds could break for either candidate and turn a nail-biter into a rout. By the same token, 2024 could produce a 269-269 tie in the Electoral College. That would throw the decision on who will be the next president to House of Representatives. That hasn\u2019t happened since 1824, when the House chose John Quincy Adams over Andrew Jackson, the candidate who won the most popular votes.\n\nSo buckle up. A lot can happen in six months.\n\nCampaign Update\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. challenged Trump to a head-to-head debate later this month at the Libertarian National Convention in Washington, DC.\n\nThe Kennedy campaign announced this week that he has made the presidential ballot in Delaware, Biden\u2019s home state, as a candidate of the Independent Party. Kennedy is now officially on the ballot in five states. The others are California, Hawaii, Michigan, and Utah. Michigan is the only state so far where Kennedy\u2019s candidacy looks as if it could tilt the outcome to either Biden or Trump.\n\nThe Candidates in Their Own Words\n\nBiden visited Racine, Wisconsin, on Wednesday to tout Microsoft\u2019s decision to invest $3.3 billion of its own money to build a new data center for artificial intelligence work. The Microsoft project is being built on the site where Trump in 2017 promised that the electronics firm Foxconn would spend $10 billion to build a factory that he described as the \u201ceighth wonder of the world.\u201d Biden didn\u2019t miss the opportunity to argue that Trump was all bluster and no product: \u201cHe and his administration promised a $10 billion investment by Foxconn\u2026 He came here with your senator, Ron Johnson, literally holding a golden shovel, promising to build the \u2018eighth wonder of the world\u2019\u2026 They dug a hole with those golden shovels, and then they fell into it.\u201d\n\nWhile in Racine, Biden made more news in an interview with CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett in which he said he would stop the shipment of offensive weapons to Israel if it went forward with an invasion of Rafah. He argued that \u201ccivilians have been killed in Gaza as a consequence of those bombs and other ways in which they (Israel) go after population centers... They\u2019re not going to get our support if in fact they go on these population centers.\u201d But Biden insisted that he remained committed to supplying Israel with defensive weapons: \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to make sure Israel is secure in terms of Iron Dome and their ability to respond to attacks that came out of the Middle East recently.\u201d\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Biden CNN Interview Video Pause Video Pause Biden CNN Interview Embed\n\nTrump denounced Biden\u2019s comments, saying: \u201cWell, I wouldn't do what Biden did. He just abandoned Israel. I've never seen anything like it.\u201d\n\nTrump went on to say \u201cif you\u2019re Jewish and vote for him [Biden], I say, \u2018Shame on you.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhat the Pundits Are Saying\n\nGeoff Duncan, Georgia\u2019s Republican lieutenant governor from 2019-2023, penned an op-ed for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution on Monday announcing that he will vote for Biden in November. Duncan argued that \u201cthe GOP will never rebuild until we move on from the Trump era, leaving conservative (but not angry) Republicans like me no choice but to pull the lever for Biden. At the same time, we should work to elect GOP congressional majorities to block his second-term legislative agenda and provide a check and balance. The alternative is another term of Trump, a man who has disqualified himself through his conduct and his character.\u201d\n\nRolling Stone ran a story claiming that Trump will send covert teams into Mexico to kill the leaders and enforcers of Mexican drug cartels should he reclaim the presidency. \u201cIn conversations with close MAGA allies, including at least one Republican lawmaker,\u201d Rolling Stone reports, \u201cTrump has privately endorsed the idea of covertly deploying\u2014with or without the Mexican government\u2019s consent\u2014special-ops units that would be tasked with, among other missions, assassinating the leaders and top enforcers of Mexico\u2019s powerful and most notorious drug cartels.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post reported that Trump told a gathering of oil industry executives last month that he would repeal Biden\u2019s climate change initiatives if they raised $1 billion to return him (Trump) to White House. Among other things, Trump \u201cpromised that he would scrap Biden\u2019s \u2018mandate\u2019 on electric vehicles.\u201d That pledge, however, may upset the auto industry. It has \u201cinvested billions of dollars in the transition away from gasoline-powered cars. Many automakers are under increasing pressure to sell more EVs in Europe, which has tightened its own tailpipe emissions rules, and they are eager to avoid a patchwork of regulations around the globe.\u201d\n\nWhat the Polls Show\n\nGallup released a report on Monday analyzing how China and the United States are viewed around the world. The analysis was based on polling done in 133 countries. Gallup found that the United States was viewed more favorably in eighty-one countries in 2023, with the other fifty-two favoring China. Kosovo, Israel, Poland, Ukraine, and Vietnam were the counties that most closely aligned with the United States. Russia, Iran, Serbia, and Pakistan were the countries that tilted most heavily toward China. When looking how these numbers have changed over time, Gallup concluded that \u201cthe U.S. appears to enjoy a significant net approval advantage under Democratic leadership and a significant disadvantage under Republican leadership.\u201d\n\nThe Pew Research Center released a poll on Wednesday showing growing divides between Democrats and Republicans over NATO and Ukraine. Overall, 58 percent of Americans have a positive view of NATO. But that number obscures stark partisan differences. Seventy-five percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents view NATO favorably. That compares with just 43 percent of Republicans and Republic-leaning independents, a number that is down from 55 percent in 2022. In the case of Ukraine, 36 percent of those surveyed says that U.S. support for Ukraine helps U.S. interests, 36 percent says it hurts, and the remainder say it has no impact. However, 49 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say support for Ukraine helps U.S. interests, while 47 percent of Republicans and Republic-leaning independents say it hurts.\n\nThe Campaign Schedule\n\nThe Republican National Convention opens in Milwaukee in sixty-six days (July 15, 2024).\n\nThe Democratic National Convention opens in Chicago in 101 days (August 19, 2024).\n\nThe first in-person absentee voting in the nation begins in Minnesota and South Dakota in 133 days (September 20, 2024).\n\nElection Day is 179 days away.\n\nInauguration Day is 255 days away.\n\nSinet Adous and Michelle Kurilla assisted in the preparation of this post.\n\nThis publication is part of the Diamonstein-Spielvogel Project on the Future of Democracy.",

        "text": "Harvard Youth Poll Results\n18-to-29-Year-old\u2019s Politically Active, But Ill-informed\n\nThe Institute of Politics (IOP) at the Harvard Kennedy School released its 47th Edition of the Survey of Young Americans\u2019 Attitudes toward Politics and Public Service, a Harvard Youth Poll.\n\nThe analysis is based on the data collected from 2,010 young American citizens between the ages of 18 and 29, who were interviewed from March 14 - 21, 2024. The study was supervised by John Della Volpe, Director of Polling from the Harvard Public Opinion Project, and assisted by undergraduate students.\n\nThe Harvard Youth Poll uncovered many interesting facts about two cohorts of young Americans. The first cohort is 18 - 24 years old, so-called Generation Z; and the second cohort is 25-29 years old, so-called millennials. These young citizens are relevant to the political discourse in the U.S. We will review five key findings.\n\n\n\n1. Politically Active: 75% are Registered to Vote in 2024\n\nFirst, young Americans are active participants in the democratic process. In the 2020 Presidential Election, 69% of young Americans voted. Due to the pandemic, only 32% of them voted in a polling station, while 8% voted early, and almost a third of young Americans (29%) voted by mail/absentee ballot. It is a very encouraging trend.\n\nLess than a third (27%) of young Americans sat out the 2020 election. Compared with overall voter participation in the U.S. during the Presidential Election, young Americans\u2019 participation rate is five percentage points higher! According to the US Elections Project, the national overall participation rate was 66%.\n\nThis year, three-quarters, 75%, of young Americans are registered to vote, and 66% plan to vote in the 2024 Presidential Election, an additional 13% state that they are 50-50 likely to vote. Only 21% of young Americans \u201cprobably\u201d or \u201cdefinitely won\u2019t be voting.\u201d U.S. Vote Foundation applauds the intention of young Americans to exercise their right to vote.\n\n\n\n2. Young Americans are Concerned: 58% Think the Country is On \u201cThe Wrong Track\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, while many young Americans are active as voters, far fewer are happy with the direction the United States of America is heading. In fact, 58% of the participants of the survey think that the country is on \u201cthe wrong track,\u201d while only 9% (less than 10%) of the participants believe that the country is \u201cgenerally headed in the right direction.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, young Americans are not content with the state of U.S. democracy. Only 3% describe the U.S. as \u201ca healthy democracy,\u201d and 20% state that the country is a \u201ca somewhat functioning democracy.\u201d It is alarming to see that 62% of young Americans think that the U.S. democracy has issues. Indeed, the study specifies that 16% believe that the U.S. is \u201ca failed democracy,\u201d and 46% believe that the U.S. is \u201ca democracy in trouble\u201d.\n\nAll in all, the majority of young Americans think that democracy in the U.S. faces significant challenges.\n\n\n\n3. 62% Think that the Government Doesn\u2019t Represent the Country They Love\n\nApparently young Americans disapprove of the job performance of the U.S. President, as well as the Democrats and the Republicans in Congress. More than half of the young Americans (64% and 62% of young Americans, respectively) disapprove of the job performance of the present administration. The same trend is seen with the approval ratings of both the Democrats and Republicans in the U.S. Congress: 60% of young Americans disapprove of the Democrats in Congress, and 70% of young Americans disapprove of the Republicans in Congress.\n\nFurthermore, young Americans are distrustful of billionaires (90%), Wall Street (86%), the Media (86%), Congress (83%), the federal government (79%), the President (76%), the Supreme Court (72%), and the United States military (60%). Overall, 62% of young Americans feel that the government doesn\u2019t represent the country they love, and 69% of young Americans are \u201cconcerned about the moral direction of the country.\u201d Repairing this trust will not come easily. It will take concerted effort on the part of the current and future administrations.\n\n\n\n4. 73% of Young Americans Use Social Media Platforms to Stay Informed about Current Events\n\nWhile being distrustful about the trajectory of the U.S., young Americans seem to be more informed about the current events and political developments in the country and abroad. Unfortunately, most of them count on social media platforms information about news and current events.\n\nAccording to the Poll, Instagram (25%), TikTok (23%), Facebook (19%), X (16%), and Snapchat (8%) are the top sources for staying informed. Furthermore, young Americans obtain their knowledge about domestic and international developments through YouTube (25%), local TV news (22%), CNN (14%), Fox News (12%), and MSNBC (7%). They do not read newspapers or periodicals on any regular basis.\n\n\n\n5. Concerns are Multi-fold: Economic Issues Dominate\n\nLastly, the political concerns that young Americans express are multi-fold. Almost a third of them (27%) are concerned with economic issues, such as the general economic situation (11%) as well as inflation, increasing cost of living (8%), and illegal immigration (9%). Only 8% of young Americans are concerned about foreign policy and national security, while barely 6% are troubled with environmental issues. More than half, 58% of young Americans, think finding a permanent job after graduation will be difficult.\n\nWhile asked about a set of 16 issues facing the United States, they identified the following issues as being most critical: inflation (64%), healthcare (59%), housing (56%), gun violence (54%), jobs (53%), protecting democracy (52%), corruption (52%), education (50%), women\u2019s reproductive rights (50%), crime (47%), immigration (47%), taxes (43%), and climate change (43%). In other words, economic concerns still dominate.\n\nOverall, the 47th Edition of the Harvard Youth Poll puts forward a number of findings that U.S. Vote Foundation would like to underscore.\n\nWhile exercising their right to vote, young Americans are concerned about the United States' economic situation and the direction the country is heading toward.\n\n\n\nOur nation\u2019s younger voters are deeply distrustful of the politico-social system.\n\n\n\nThey are regularly informed through use of social media, which, unfortunately, is not required to obey the same professional and factual standards as the established press.\n\n\n\nU.S. Vote Foundation sees this \u2018social media as news\u2019 trend as dangerous in the long term and continues to be committed to providing credible information about elections and the voting rights of U.S. citizens no matter where they reside.

        "text": "2024 U.S. Presidential Election: The Effects of Trump\u2019s Tariff Policy\nThe year 2024 is the year of the U.S. presidential election. Based on the results of the primaries so far, the Republican candidate is effectively confirmed to be former President Trump, and the Democratic candidate is current President Biden, making the 2024 U.S. presidential election a rematch of the 2020 election. This study examines the background of Trump's tariff policies and estimates the economic effects of scenarios.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe theoretical background of U.S. tariff policy can be attributed to a so-called \u2018beg-gar-thy-neighbor\u2019 approach. In reality, policy makers consider economic, trade policy, and political factors. Based on the confirmed tariff policies from the Trump campaign, the tariff imposition levels are divided into three categories: (1) Universal tariffs (10%p), (2) Application of Section 301 (25%p or 60% to China), and (3) Reciprocal tariffs (based on the tariff rate difference between the U.S. and its counter-part). The target countries are segmented into (1) FTA signatories, (2) Non-FTA signatories, and (3) China. Additionally, two cases were analyzed, (1) Unilateral tariff imposition by the U.S. and (2) Implementation of retaliatory tariffs by its counterpart, making a total of ten scenarios.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe U.S. trade balance could improve by $171.5 billion to $315.3 billion depending on the scenarios. On the contrary, additional tariffs imposed by the U.S. are expected to have a negative impact on the U.S. economic growth in all scenarios. The adverse impact on consumer prices is expected to be significant. Depending on the scenario, Korea's total exports are forecasted to decrease by $5.3 billion to $24.1 billion.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Important Things Happening in Mexico Deserve Close US Attention\nOn June 2, Mexicans will choose a new president, a new congress, and many thousands of state and local officials in Mexico\u2019s largest election ever.\n\nAt present, polls show a large advantage to Claudia Sheinbaum, the presidential candidate supported by incumbent President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (AMLO), over her principle rival, Xochitl Galvez, who heads the opposition coalition ticket.\n\nBeyond the presidential race, the outcomes in congressional and state elections will have big implications for the political clout of Mexico\u2019s new president, the temperature of political debates, and the potential for approving major reforms of Mexico\u2019s institutions, championed by AMLO to further his vision of Mexico\u2019s transformation.\n\nAs elections approach, analysts in Mexico, the US, and internationally have expressed serious concern about the strength of Mexico\u2019s democracy and the potential negative impact of AMLO\u2019s proposed reforms.\n\nGiven the closely interconnected relationship between Mexico and the United States, Americans must pay close attention to the outcomes Mexico\u2019s elections and what follows. The US needs good working relations with its southern neighbor to deal with migration, crime and trade issues.\n\nGiven that the newly legislature takes office on September 1, AMLO is hoping that his allies will win a 2/3 majority in both houses of Congress in June, allowing him to win passage of his proposed constitutional and legal reforms before he leaves office on October 1. The proposals would significantly alter the workings of Mexico\u2019s electoral authorities, congress, judiciary, and independent regulatory institutions, among other institutions. The thrust of the reforms as proposed would centralize more power in the executive branch and the presidency. However, there is significant opposition to several proposals, including some that previously spurred mass protests. It is far from clear what may result.\n\nWhat happens in Mexico is vital for the US. US-Mexico ties touch the daily lives of more Americans than any other country in the world. Mexico is the US\u2019s largest trade and co-production partner, supporting some 5 million US jobs. Most irregular migration crosses the US-Mexican border. Mexico remain the largest single source of US migrants and the source of family and cultural ties for over 35 million US citizens. Importantly, t he vast majority of the deadly fentanyl fueling US overdose deaths comes thru Mexico.\n\nThe US-Mexico relationship is simultaneously domestic and international for both countries. There is much to gain by good cooperation, but the policies and politics of both countries often spur tensions and discord. It takes strong political commitment and skillful management to sustain good collaboration.\n\nOf great concern is that the quality of Mexico\u2019s democracy and governance has been declining, according to a variety of reports that compare countries around the world. This alarming trend gets too little attention.\n\nMexico faces daunting challenges in building prosperity and assuring rule of law. Regular news reports of criminal violence and thriving cartel power underscore this. Mexico has had more homicides during the current presidential administration than during any other presidential term in recent decades. Mexico is ranked as having the third worst criminality score globally, with extortion and other crimes deepening. A key study notes that despite improvements, Mexico was substantially less peaceful in 2023 than it was in 2015. Significant violence mars the ongoing election campaign . Many worry about organized crime shaping local elections .\n\nRespected international studies put Mexico\u2019s democracy in a broader perspective.\n\nThe Bertelsmann Transformation Index, covering some 130 countries, shows Mexico dropping in its scores between 2016 to 2024. It argues that Mexico is \u201ccurrently on a path of de-democratization\u201d. It cites attacks on independent institutions and a significant decline in Mexico\u2019s rule of law and governance scores, among other concerns.\n\nThe Economist Intelligence Unit\u2019s Democracy Index 2023 ranks Mexico 90th out of the 167 countries it studied. This index categorizes Mexico as a \u201chybrid\u201d democracy, which falls below a \u201cfull\u201d or a \u201cflawed\u201d democracy. It finds Mexico\u2019s ranking dropped 15% since 2018 and highlights the numbers of civilian deaths related to criminal violence.\n\nInternational IDEA\u2019s Global State of Democracy Indices, which cover 173 countries, finds that since 2018 Mexico has declined in 12 of the 22 indicators it uses for assessing countries. The biggest declines are in parliamentary effectiveness, freedom of speech, press freedom, judicial independence, predictable enforcement, and strength of civil society.\n\nThe Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) Democracy Reports, which cover 202 countries, find a notable decline in Mexico\u2019s ratings for all of its indexes, and shows particularly large drops in Mexico\u2019s scores for \u201cdeliberative democracy\u201d, \u201cliberal democracy,\u201d and \u201celectoral democracy\u201d. V-Dem cites attacks on judicial and electoral institutions, false government information, and increased polarization, among other issues.\n\nFreedom House\u2019s latest Freedom in the World report, rating some 195 countries, characterizes Mexico as \u201cpartly free.\u201d It describes a decline in freedoms beginning after 2017 and flags concerns with organized crime and violence, corruption, lack of government transparency, poor rule of law, and civil liberties more broadly.\n\nThe World Justice Project\u2019s Rule of Law Index finds that Mexico\u2019s rule of law scores declined notably between 2018 and 2023 among the 100 plus countries analyzed, with particularly bad ratings on corruption, security, and criminal justice performance.\n\nThe World Bank prepares Worldwide Governance Indicators covering over 200 countries and territories. The data from 2012, 2017 and 2022 show Mexico\u2019s percentile rank declined in every category over the ten years, with the largest drops in government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law, and control of corruption.\n\nFinally, a 2023 Pew survey of 24 countries also flashed warning on Mexico\u2019s democracy. The Pew survey showed that support for a leader making decisions without interference from a parliament or court had grown more in Mexico than in any other country studied (rising 23% to 50% of those polled).\n\nThe key point: it is essential understand Mexico\u2019s current election cycle in the context of the serious concerns raised by expert studies examining democracy and governance around the globe. These echo Mexico-focused analyses by commentators and organizations about violation of human rights and civil liberties, attacks on individuals and NGOs that criticize the government, and violence against journalists and activists.\n\nMexicans have the most at stake, but next in line is the United States. The US is invested heavily in US-Mexico ties, including with a major trade agreement and a massive presence of US companies. Mexico and the US have set up regular meetings to address difficult issues. This process has produced good dialogue on trade, closer collaboration on migration, and improved but far from satisfactory cooperation on public security and drug trafficking.\n\nThe bottom line is that we all need to pay closer attention to the results of Mexico\u2019s June 2 elections and their aftermath. If AMLO\u2019s preferred presidential candidate and his party win 2/3 of Congress, we can expect to see an effort to amend Mexico\u2019s constitution in ways that analysts warn would further weaken the independence of Mexico\u2019s courts and rule of law, its electoral authorities, other independent regulatory bodies, and the participation of smaller parties in Congress, concentrating more power in the executive branch. The scenarios will build from the actual election outcomes.\n\nA constant will remain, however: the United States and Mexico are profoundly intertwined. The US will be better off with a strong, democratic Mexican partner to help strengthen prosperity and security, just as Mexico needs a strong partner in the US. Both countries need to understand the trends shaping electoral outcomes on the other side of the border and engage each other to forge as constructive a partnership as possible. This will bring better outcomes for Americans and Mexicans.",

        "text": "Poll Tracker: The Dominican Republic's 2024 Presidential Election\nDominican President Luis Abinader looks like he\u2019s on solid footing to win a second term. He is one of the region\u2019s most popular leaders, with an approval rating of roughly 70 percent. His anti-corruption message has resonated with citizens and, under his leadership, the Dominican Republic has boasted one the highest GDP growth rates in Latin America.\n\nSo it may come as little surprise that the incumbent leads polls ahead of the country\u2019s May 19 presidential vote. The 56-year-old, who represents the Modern Revolutionary Party (PRM), will be joined on the ballot by former President Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez (1996\u20132000; 2004\u20132012) of the Dominican Liberation Party (PLD) and Mayor Abel Mart\u00ednez of the People\u2019s Force (FP). Several other candidates will compete but all are polling well below 1 percent. If no candidate receives over 50 percent of the vote, a runoff between the top two will take place on June 30.\n\nVoting isn\u2019t compulsory in the Dominican Republic. Turnout for presidential contests in the country hovers around 70 percent, with the figure from the pandemic-era 2020 election an aberration at 55 percent.\n\nWho is leading the polls? What are Dominicans\u2019 top issues? AS/COA Online explores.",

        "text": "Mexico\u2019s Next President Will Face a Security Emergency That Can\u2019t Be Ignored\nMexican gangs have multiplied during the current administration, corrupting local democracies and tightening their grip on the economy. So far, Claudia Sheinbaum, the leading presidential candidate for the June 2 elections, has kept vague on her security proposals. But in office, she would undoubtedly face ever more brazen\u2014and political\u2014criminal actors.\n\nSince the election of President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador in 2018, organized crime has ramped up efforts to strong-arm the state. Favored tactics include road blockades, banners threatening officials, and the dumping of human remains outside government buildings.\n\nPolitical assassinations are the most direct line of attack. The current campaign season is shaping up to be the deadliest on record, according to data from the Mexican think tank, Laboratorio Electoral. Since the start of the election season on September 7th, 2023 until the publication of this piece, 29 political aspirants and candidates have been slain. Hundreds have withdrawn from the race (such as 358 candidates in Zacatecas and another 190 candidates in Michoac\u00e1n)\u2014while an unknown quantity chose not to risk running at all.\n\nOrganized crime groups were likely behind most of these killings. As politicians across the country hit the campaign trail, gangs launched their own violent bids for increased protection and influence.\n\nCriminals are also desperate to collaborate with politicians. Gangs have little chance of survival unless they can secure under-the-table deals with mayors and turf pacts with police. Illegal campaign financing is an ongoing concern. In troubled regions, criminal groups even field their own candidates.\n\nAlongside the growing threat of \u201cnarco politics,\u201d the new Mexican president will also have to shield the economy from the worst impacts of criminality. In recent years, gangs have diversified beyond drug trafficking. Illicit activities such as cargo theft and counterfeiting are a mounting problem for the private sector.\n\nExtortion is an even greater menace to businesses. Criminal groups historically demanded payments from vendors, such as market workers or chicken shop owners. Today, they routinely fix prices by forcing smaller businesses to buy products at inflated costs from suppliers they have compromised; for instance, fruit or poultry farms. Business leaders say gangs in at least 10 Mexican states are even banning the sale of products from companies outside their extortion rackets.\n\nNor is this crisis contained. Security challenges in Mexico have consequences that cross borders. Gangs threaten regional supply chains and forcibly displace communities, fueling undocumented migration. Criminal fragmentation also risks creating new entrants into the fentanyl market. That shift could deepen the US opioid crisis, as inexperienced cooks inaccurately measure substances.\n\nSheinbaum, the candidate for the ruling National Regeneration Movement (Morena) party, is keen to downplay this situation. The heavy favorite for the presidency, Sheinbaum has already backed the non-confrontational approach of President L\u00f3pez Obrador. She also plans to double down on the militarization of public security. As well as spending heavily on the army, Sheinbaum hopes to complete the transfer of the National Guard, Mexico\u2019s main law enforcement agency, from civilian to military control. But neither the army nor the National Guard have proven effective in tackling criminal conspiracies. Both forces have also been tied to widespread human rights abuses.\n\nDespite these failings, the leading candidate has outlined some policies that could prove effective. Sheinbaum hopes to strengthen Mexico\u2019s intelligence agency and create a national crime database. She also wants to classify extortion as a serious crime.\n\nBut the next administration will face security challenges of an unprecedented scale. Turning a blind eye to the crisis is unlikely to remain an option. The widespread use of shock and awe tactics by Mexican mafias, criminal infiltration into politics, and the economic impact of extortion will demand a response from the new president. That emergency will heighten calls to strengthen investigative capacities and counter the outrageous impunity that persists across Mexico.\n\nGreater cooperation with US security agencies is also essential. Both countries need to scrutinize suspicious financial activity and crack down on weapons trafficking. To be truly effective, Mexico\u2019s next president must work from an understanding that insecurity in Mexico is part of a shared crisis with the United States.",

        "text": "Nearly 80 officials overseeing elections in 7 swing states doubt 2020 results\nReno \u2014 Washoe County, Nevada, is a battleground county in a critical battleground state and may hold the keys to congressional contests, and potentially the presidency. But in this cycle, one of the most consequential races in the state is that of county commissioner.\n\nThat commissioner would wield the swing vote on a panel that \u2014 among other responsibilities \u2014 oversees elections in Washoe. Members appoint the county's top election official, set the budget for elections and ultimately certify statewide election results.\n\n\"It's important to realize that we are in a national election, that national election is being run at the local level,\" said Democratic Secretary of State Francisco Aguilar in an interview. \"And at that local level, they can completely shut down the election at the state, for the state and for the nation.\"\n\nAt a time when the electoral process has come under withering attack by former President Donald Trump and his boisterous MAGA following, control of the elections has emerged as a target of his allies in places like Washoe County, despite a persistent lack of evidence of widespread voter fraud in Washoe, or any other county in the U.S.\n\nA new CBS News investigation found there are nearly 80 officials working in election oversight positions across seven battleground states, including Nevada, who don't believe the 2020 election results, refused to certify the election, publicly supported the actions taken on Jan. 6, 2021 in the U.S. Capitol riots or have pushed election conspiracies.\n\nIn Washoe, the power of the commission has attracted the attention of a powerful and wealthy right-wing activist named Robert Beadles, who has falsely claimed the 2020 election was rigged. Since 2022, he has been lobbying in support of controversial voting changes introduced by other Commissioners, which include eliminating voting machines in favor of hand-counting paper ballots and having the National Guard at polling places \u2014 steps the ACLU has called \"categorically illegal.\"\n\nBeadles, who says he made his fortune in real estate and cryptocurrency, has spent significantly in local elections for school board, city council and the state legislature. He has also spent over $100,000 on commission races, particularly in support of two of the five current commissioners, Jeannie Herman and Michael Clark, both of whom have pushed election conspiracies or denied that Joe Biden won the election. This cycle, he aims to build a majority on the commission to promote his agenda.\n\n\"We have our two superheros on the county commission. We have Mike Clark and Jeanne Herman.\" Beadles said in a video posted to his Facebook. \"However, those two votes are not enough. We need three.\"\n\n\"If you want to save a county, you save the county commission, because they're the ones with one vote that can fix or destroy the county,\" Beadles told CBS News at a local Republican event he was moderating. \"People are looking at the president and Senate and all those types and that's great, but that one person can't necessarily make a difference. As much as one person in the county commission or city council can, they could sway the entire board.\"\n\nIn his pursuit of one more vote on the county commission, Beadles has targeted fellow Republican and a current commissioner, Clara Andriola, for defeat in the upcoming June primary. Andriola has held the line against the voting changes Beadles has proposed \u2014 which contributed to her censure by the Washoe County GOP \u2014 where Beadles serves on the executive committee. That committee also passed a resolution in 2022 claiming that President Biden was not legitimately elected.\n\n\"It was disappointing. It was hurtful \u2026 but I am a Republican, I still am a Republican and I will vote as a Republican,\" Andriola said of the censure. When asked how she thinks elections are run in Washoe, Andriola told CBS News. \"I think elections have been run as best as we can.\"\n\nBut for Beadles, Andriola is not Republican enough. Instead, he is backing several other Republican candidates, including Andriola's primary opponent, Republican Tracey Hilton-Thomas. In an interview with CBS, during a campaign stop, Hilton-Thomas says she works closely with Beadles and current Republican Commissioner to draft new election resolutions.\n\n\"I do believe that there is interference in our elections,\" said Hilton-Thomas. When asked whether she believed the results of the 2020 election, she said: \"I would have to say at this time, no, I do not believe the results \u2026 they won't show us, they won't show us the proof, we have to just trust their word. And I'm not a person that trusts people's word.\"\n\nBeadles has continued to peddle false claims about election fraud. In 2022, he told the Washoe County Commission that \"the elections are rigged \u2026 it's treason, you all are committing treason.\" He directed much of his ire about the election at County Registrar Deanna Spikula, who later resigned her position after facing an onslaught of harassment. Beadles has denied any responsibility for the harassment of Spikula or other officials.\n\nBeadles filed a lawsuit to try and block the The Election Worker Protection Act, which makes it a felony to harass, threaten or intimidate election workers. The suit has twice been rejected in federal court, but Beadles filed another appeal earlier this month. A public affairs officer with Washoe County Commissions said there has been a 100% turnover of election officials in that office since 2020.\n\nThe Reno activist has been promoted by Steve Bannon, a former top adviser to Donald Trump.\n\n\"They're really scared of Trump, but what they should be scared of is like 25 (million) to 100 million little Trump 2.0s running around the country,\" Beadles said on Bannon's \"War Room\" podcast.\n\nIn the June 11 primary, Washoe County voters will decide whether or not to vote out Andriola. And if Beadles is successful in getting one more vote on the commission, his allies will be in charge of certifying elections in the future.\n\nAguilar, the Nevada secretary of state, says election deniers \"understand the power of a county at the national level \u2026 Nevada is a battleground state, we are going to be part of a small group of states who determines the next president of the United States. And when you start to break down the data in the information county by county, you start to recognize the power of Washoe.\"",

        "text": "Carter Center and Rice\u2019s Baker Institute to Hold Panel Discussions on Best Election Practices\nATLANTA (May 13, 2024) \u2014 The Carter Center and Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute for Public Policy on May 17 will host panel discussions on guiding principles for election administration and reforms. The participants will examine key issues affecting U.S. elections and potential ways to strengthen elections and build confidence in their outcomes. The event will be held at The Carter Center in Atlanta.\n\nScheduled panelists include former Washington Secretary of State Kim Wyman; former Kentucky Secretary of State Trey Grayson; and former Rhode Island Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea. The panels will be moderated by Doug Chapin, senior fellow for program evaluation and policy analysis at Fors Marsh, and David Becker, executive director and founder of The Center for Election Innovation & Research.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to support good election practices and principles across the country,\u201d said David Carroll, director of the Carter Center\u2019s Democracy Program. \u201cWe hope to counter efforts that seek to weaponize election processes and to support democratic institutions and elections that serve all voters, regardless of party.\u201d\n\nIn February, The Carter Center and the Baker Institute published a report, \u201cGuiding Principles for Election Administration,\u201d to help build confidence in U.S. elections. The report identified 10 guiding principles critical to healthy election systems. The principles provide a framework for bipartisan policies that lead to greater confidence in elections as well as the need for equitable access and integrity of the results.\n\nThe Carter Center and the Baker Institute have partnered since 2020 to work on U.S. election issues, inspired by the bipartisan leadership of former U.S. President Jimmy Carter and former Secretary of State James A. Baker, III, who co-chaired the 2005 Commission on Federal Election Reform. \u201cElections are the heart of democracy,\u201d wrote Carter and Baker at the time, flagging concerns that eroding public trust in elections could endanger our democracy.\n\n\u201cThe May 17 event reaffirms the commitment that President Carter and Secretary Baker have to develop bipartisan ways to conduct elections that are both fair and secure \u2014 key elements required of generating confidence in the outcomes of U.S. elections,\u201d said John Williams, a Baker Institute fellow who oversees the institute\u2019s Presidential Elections Program.\n\nAn archive of this event can be viewed live here.\n\n###\n\nRelated Resources\n\nRead the Guiding Principles for Election Administration\n\nView the agenda\n\nContact: In Atlanta, Maria Cartaya, maria.cartaya@cartercenter.org\n\nIn Houston, Karina Zemel, karina.zemel@rice.edu\n\nThe Carter Center\n\nWaging Peace.

        "text": "The Good, the Bad, and the Unknown: AI\u2019s Impact on the 2024 Presidential Election\nThe 2024 presidential election has the potential to be one of the most consequential in generations. With significant political ideologies across the country, candidates, campaigns, and election officials are recently turning more to artificial intelligence to share their messages, reach more voters, and administer a secure election. However, these same tools could also be used for misinformation and cultivation of distrust in the electoral process. Given the stakes, this election is likely to shape the direction of the country for decades to come \u2013 and AI is set to play a major role.\n\nThe Risks and Challenges of Using AI in Elections\n\nThe rapid rise of AI and the lack of cohesive regulations has brought significant moral and technical challenges for society. The potential for AI to have negative impacts is perhaps most consequential in government and elections, where the \u201cWild West\u201d of AI is stoking public fears and threatening election integrity in several ways:\n\nDisinformation and Deepfakes : AI\u2019s ability to create deepfakes and spread disinformation, especially through social media platforms, can create false narratives, impersonate candidates, and manipulate public opinion. Recently, a robocall to New Hampshire voters in January \u2013 which used a deepfake audio recording allegedly from Joe Biden \u2013 urged voters not to vote in the Democratic primaries. To many experts, the proliferation of disinformation and deepfakes poses the most serious threat to election integrity and voter trust.\n\nElection Interference : AI can be used by both domestic and foreign actors to target the integrity of election systems like registration databases and voting machines, as well as exploit human psychology to sway voters and outcomes. In the 2016 presidential election, international hackers used AI to breach the Democratic National Committee\u2019s network, leak sensitive information, and spread distrust in the system.\n\nAlgorithmic Bias : A major concern with AI is the potential for algorithmic bias or discrimination, which can result in systems that may inadvertently disenfranchise certain groups of voters and favor certain candidates or parties.\n\nPrivacy Concerns: With AI managing large amounts of sensitive data, such as voter registration records and political preferences, these databases are common targets for attacks. The risk of data breaches and misuse \u2013 like the Cambridge Analytica scandal that harvested personal information on 87 million Facebook users against their consent for political advertising \u2013 can expose voters to identity theft, fraud, or harassment.\n\nThe Opportunities and Benefits of Using AI in Elections\n\nDespite these challenges and risks, AI may also have a significant positive impact on the 2024 presidential election. It offers exciting opportunities to reach and inform more voters, strengthen election integrity, and make the entire voting process more efficient. Here are a few ways AI could play a positive role in upcoming elections:\n\nTargeted Messaging : AI can help campaigns create messages that target audiences more precisely by collecting and analyzing massive amounts of voter demographic and behavioral data. AI can be used to segment audiences and tailor messages that appeal to voters\u2019 individual values and interests, helping campaigns reach more voters, especially those who are undecided or in swing states.\n\nInstant Responses : AI can be used to generate immediate responses to videos, speeches, and breaking news, which can keep voters informed. It can also help campaigns analyze the content and sentiment of their opponents\u2019 statements so they can more efficiently offer effective counter-messages.\n\nElection Administration: AI can streamline and automate certain election tasks, such as verifying voter eligibility, scanning and counting ballots, and detecting and resolving errors. Some states have already begun using AI to verify mail-in ballot signatures, providing the potential for a more efficient and secure verification process.\n\nVoter Education: AI can be used to educate voters by providing relevant and reliable information about candidates, their platforms, and the voting process. These tools can help voters evaluate and compare different sources and perspectives, while allowing candidates a way to reach and engage a large number of voters.\n\nUsing AI to Ensure Election Integrity\n\nAI\u2019s potential impact on the election process requires careful consideration and safeguards to ensure the integrity of democratic processes. Here are a few strategies being proposed or already implemented that aim to protect the quality and legitimacy of the upcoming presidential election:\n\nThe Future AI Use in Free and Fair Elections\n\nWhile AI has the potential to transform and optimize the electoral process, it also requires careful and responsible use, as well as ongoing adaptation to new technological challenges. The same tools used to reach and educate voters can be used to spread information and manipulate voter behavior. AI will certainly have a significant role in the 2024 presidential election and beyond, but ensuring that its uses are truthful, ethical, and respectful of voters\u2019 privacy and best interests.\n\nPursuing AI Education and Careers\n\nCapitol Technology University offers programs in Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Data Science that put you at the forefront of ethical AI use and management of AI technology.

        "text": "Biden hits Chinese electric cars and solar cells with higher tariffs\nBiden hits Chinese electric cars and solar cells with higher tariffs\n\nGetty Images\n\nUS President Joe Biden is ramping up tariffs on Chinese-made electric cars, solar panels, steel and other goods.\n\nThe White House said the measures, which include a 100% border tax on electric cars from China, were a response to unfair policies and intended to protect US jobs.\n\nChina said it was opposed to the hikes and would take retaliatory measures.\n\nAnalysts said the tariffs were largely symbolic and intended to shore up votes in a tough election year.\n\nThey follow months of criticism by former President Donald Trump, who is running for the White House against Mr Biden and has argued his rival's support for electric cars would \"kill\" the US car industry.\n\nMr Biden on Tuesday vowed that he would not let China \"unfairly control the market\" for electric vehicles and other key goods, including batteries, computer chips and basic medical supplies.\n\n\"If the pandemic taught us anything - we need to have a secure supply of essentials here at home,\" he said.\n\nThe tariffs announced on Tuesday will hit an estimated $18bn worth of imports, the White House said.\n\nAs well as a rise from 25% to 100% on electric vehicle tariffs, levies on solar cells will increase from 25% to 50%.\n\nTariff rates on certain steel and aluminium products will more than triple to 25%, up from 7.5% or less.\n\nIn response, China's commerce ministry said the new moves would \"severely affect the atmosphere for bilateral cooperation\", and criticised what it characterised as the politicisation of economic issues.\n\nAhead of the heavily-trailed White House announcement on Tuesday, a spokesperson for China's foreign ministry said it \"will take all necessary measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests\".\n\nThe moves expand sweeping border taxes that the US imposed on Chinese goods under Mr Trump, citing unfair trade practices.\n\nDuring the Biden administration's review of the measures, the government received nearly 1,500 comments, the vast majority of them from business owners arguing that they were driving up prices for everyday Americans, and asking them to be removed.\n\nMr Biden's decision to leave the tariffs in place and expand them into new areas - even as persistent US inflation has weighed on his approval ratings - is a testament to the dramatic shift in trade views for both political parties in the US, which had long championed the benefits of global commerce.\n\nWendy Cutler, a former trade official for the US who is now vice-president of the Asia Society Policy Institute, said she believed Americans were willing to accept higher priced cars, in exchange for helping to protect US companies and jobs.\n\n\"We've seen this movie before - with solar, with steel and [aluminium], and when it comes to cars and other products the United States needs to get ahead of the curve,\" she said.\n\n\"It's all about trade-offs and maybe in the immediate term cars become more expensive but in the longer term we want to have a competitive industry here.\"\n\nGetty Images\n\nIn a briefing with reporters, White House officials denied that domestic politics had influenced the decision.\n\nThey said Beijing had shown no sign of moving away from practices that harm the US, including rules that force western companies to share information with the aim of stealing it and subsidies that have put firms in a position to pump out products well beyond expected demand.\n\n\"They're flooding the market,\" Mr Biden said. \"It's not competing - it's cheating.\"\n\nThe White House said the tariffs were targeted and it did not expect them to stoke inflation, contrasting their approach with that of Mr Trump.\n\nThe former president, who once called himself a \"tariff man\", has campaigned on a proposed across-the-board 10% tariff on foreign imports, which could jump to 60% for goods from China.\n\nHe has also attacked Mr Biden for promoting electric vehicles, a move he has argued will destroy US car companies, key employers in states such as Michigan that will be key election battlegrounds in November.\n\nErica York, senior economist at the Tax Foundation, said both candidates were \"heading down the same path\" of higher barriers to trade and looking inward \"rather than looking at what we can do on the policy front that would actually make our sectors more competitive\".\n\nShe said the administration's promotion of the tariffs as strategic was a \"euphemism for protection for sectors that are politically important for this administration\".\n\n\"It comes down to a political economy calculus rather than what makes the most economic sense or what's most affordable for US consumers.\"\n\nThe US already imposes steep tariffs on electric vehicles made in China, which has made sales of such cars negligible.\n\nBut Washington has been watching warily as sales by Chinese companies in Europe and other countries increase.\n\nWhite House officials said ensuring that green technologies were not dominated by a single country was critical to making the transition successful and sustainable in the long run.\n\nWhile moves targeting electric vehicles are likely to have minimal practical effect, the business world is waiting to see if Europe will take similar steps, said Natasha Ebtehadj of Artemis Investment Management.\n\nNew tariffs - at a glance\n\nsemiconductors - from 25% to 50% by 2025\n\ncertain steel and aluminium products - from 7.5% to 25% in 2024\n\nelectric vehicles - from 25% to 100% in 2024\n\nlithium batteries and critical minerals - from 7.5% to 25% in 2024\n\nsolar cells - from 25% to 50% in 2024\n\nship to shore cranes - from 0% to 25% in 2024\n\nrubber medical and surgical gloves - from 7.5% to 25% in 2026\n\nThe European Union and the UK are among the other places debating moves to curb imports of Chinese-made electric cars, even at the risk of slowing their adoption.\n\n\"It's not really a surprise to investors or to Chinese companies, especially in the run-up to an election where both candidates are not really pro-China,\" she said.\n\n\"Given the relatively small volume of imports to the US, it's maybe more interesting what happens next in Europe.\"\n\nThe US and China have been locked in a trade war since 2018, when Mr Trump imposed tariffs on some two thirds of goods imported from China, at the time worth an estimated $360bn.\n\nThe measures prompted retaliation by Beijing, a stand-off that ended in a d\u00e9tente in early 2020 when Mr Trump reduced the rate of some tariffs, while China pledged to boost its purchases from the US.\n\nThose promises have fallen short, but the tariffs have since yielded more than $200bn according to the US in new border taxes for the US government, while prompting a major reshuffling of global trade patterns.\n\nMuch of that sum has been paid by everyday Americans in the form of higher prices for furniture, footwear and other goods.\n\nHowever, in a research note, Oxford Economics described the latest plans as \"more symbolic bark than bite\".\n\nThe firm said they were likely to lift inflation by a negligible 0.01 percentage points, while weighing on growth in a similar way, calling the effect a \"rounding error\".",

        "text": "The Contentious U.S.-China Trade Relationship\nIntroduction\n\nU.S. trade with China has grown enormously in recent decades and is crucial for both countries. Today, China is one of the largest export markets for U.S. goods and services, and the United States is the top export market for China. This trade has brought lower prices to U.S. consumers and higher profits for American corporations, but it has also come with costs.\n\nThe optimism that accompanied China\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) twenty years ago has vanished as Beijing continues to embrace state-led development, pouring subsidies into targeted industries to the detriment of U.S. and foreign companies. Though U.S. consumers have benefited from the flood of cheaper goods from China, millions of Americans have lost their jobs due to import competition. Meanwhile, investment by Chinese companies is raising national security concerns. The United States has long accused China of pressuring American companies to hand over their technology, or of pilfering it outright. How to respond to China now sits at the center of the U.S. political debate, with President Joe Biden following his predecessor, Donald Trump, in adopting an aggressive economic approach.\n\nWhat is the history of the U.S.-China trade relationship?\n\nFor thirty years following the establishment of the People\u2019s Republic of China in 1949, there was virtually no trade between the two countries; Washington had severed ties with the communist government in Beijing.\n\nDaily News Brief A summary of global news developments with CFR analysis delivered to your inbox each morning.

His government loosened state control over the economy and allowed private industry to develop. In 1979, the United States and China normalized relations as Chinese policymakers aimed to boost trade and investment, and in 1986 Beijing applied to rejoin the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the WTO\u2019s predecessor. After protracted negotiations with the United States and other WTO members, China joined the organization in December 2001. As a condition of admission, Beijing committed to a sweeping set of economic reforms, including steep tariff cuts for imported goods, protections for intellectual property (IP), and transparency around its laws and regulations.\n\nAt the time, U.S. President Bill Clinton and his advisors contended that bringing China into the global trading system would not only benefit the United States, but also foster economic and ultimately democratic reform in China. Still, the move was opposed by U.S. labor unions and many congressional Democrats, who argued [PDF] that China\u2019s weak worker and environmental protections would incentivize similar practices elsewhere and bring about a \u201crace to the bottom.\u201d\n\nEven before China joined the WTO, trade between the two countries was growing. But WTO membership ensured \u201cpermanent normal trade relations,\u201d thereby providing U.S. and foreign companies additional certainty that they could produce in China and export to the United States. Trade surged: the value of U.S. goods imports from China rose from about $100 billion in 2001 to more than $400 billion in 2023. This leap in imports is due in part to China\u2019s critical position in global supply chains; Chinese factories assemble products for export to the United States using components from all over the world.\n\nWhat are the benefits of this trade?\n\nU.S. consumers have benefited from lower prices, and U.S. companies have profited immensely from access to China\u2019s market. In a 2019 study, economists Xavier Jaravel and Erick Sager found that increased trade with China boosted the annual purchasing power of the average U.S. household by $1,500 between 2000 and 2007. China is now the third-largest export market for the United States, behind Canada and Mexico. A 2023 report by the U.S.-China Business Council, an industry group, found that exports to China supported more than one million jobs in the United States, or about 0.5 percent of the civilian labor force.\n\nAmerican companies earn hundreds of billions of dollars annually from sales in China\u2014money they can then invest in their U.S. operations. Chinese companies have invested tens of billions of dollars in the United States, though this investment has dwindled in recent years amid heightened U.S. government scrutiny.\n\nFor China, the gains from trade with the United States and the rest of the world have been tremendous. Since 2001, China\u2019s economy has grown more than five-fold, adjusted for inflation, and it is now the world\u2019s second largest, behind only the United States. (By some measures, it is the largest.) Hundreds of millions of people have escaped extreme poverty as a result of this growth.\n\nWhat issues has it created?\n\nThough the trade relationship has undoubtedly brought benefits, it has also presented the United States and other countries with a host of problems.\n\nManufacturing job losses. Research led by economists David Autor, David Dorn, and Gordon Hanson found that the costs of boosting trade with China, the so-called China Shock, were more pronounced than those from increased trade with other countries, such as Japan. This was due to the speed at which imports rose, the vast size of China\u2019s low-wage workforce, and the range of affected industries. Their research shows that political polarization also increased in the areas of the country most harmed by competition with China, which some analysts say helped to spur the rise of Donald Trump and populist political forces. In 2024, economists including CFR Senior Fellow Brad W. Setser referred to a renewed glut of Chinese exports\u2014particularly in electric vehicles, solar panels, and other \u201cgreen\u201d technologies\u2014as the \u201csecond China shock.\u201d\n\nNational security. U.S. policymakers are increasingly worried about Chinese efforts to spread disinformation and collect sensitive information on Americans. Wary of espionage, Washington has raised concerns that U.S. companies that use Chinese technology could be putting U.S. national security at risk. U.S. officials also fear that China\u2019s acquisition of sensitive U.S. technology will bolster China\u2019s military. They have repeatedly accused Beijing of stealing IP and requiring American companies to share their technologies as a condition of doing business in China, known as forced technology transfer.\n\nSubsidization and state-owned enterprises. To achieve its economic goals, the Chinese government has poured subsidies into a range of industries, including renewable energy, with the aim of creating \u201cnational champion\u201d companies. Some experts argue that these subsidies are wasteful, but they can be disruptive to other countries whose companies cannot compete against such levels of state support. The United States argues that many Chinese state-owned enterprises are effectively arms of the government and, unlike their private competitors, do not make decisions based on market forces.\n\nCurrency manipulation. Many economists say China kept the value of its currency, the renminbi, artificially low in the decade after it joined the WTO by accumulating U.S. dollar reserves. A weaker renminbi makes Chinese products more affordable abroad and U.S. goods more expensive in China, thereby contributing to the United States\u2019 trade deficit with China.\n\nLabor and human rights violations. The United States has long been critical of China on human rights issues, and U.S. labor groups have persistently complained about poor working conditions in China. These concerns have resurfaced on the trade agenda in recent years with reports of forced labor in Xinjiang, where China is repressing millions of Uyghurs. Beijing\u2019s 2020 national security law, which fundamentally altered Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms, is another source of tension; experts say the law could make foreign firms hesitant to do business in the city, jeopardizing its standing as a global financial hub.\n\n\u201cYou start to see how big a problem it is to try to live in this world in which China owns more and more markets and you can\u2019t get in.\u201d Jennifer Hillman ,\n\nAt the heart of the trade conflict are the two countries\u2019 competing economic systems. As journalist Paul Blustein details in his book Schism: China, America, and the Fracturing of the Global Trading System, Chinese officials enthusiastically implemented WTO requirements at first, engineering a profound transformation of the economy and legal system. But even as China liberalized its economy in some ways\u2014giving rise to a thriving private sector\u2014it never fully embraced the invisible hand of the market. The state, dominated by the Chinese Communist Party, oversees the economy through centralized management of state-owned enterprises, control over financial institutions, and a powerful economic planning commission. China\u2019s leaders say their system is necessary to improve the lives of the Chinese people and is in line with the economic strategies used by Western countries at similar stages of development.\n\nCFR\u2019s Jennifer Hillman says Beijing has perfected the model of obtaining Western technology; it uses it to develop domestic companies into giants, and then unleashes them into the world market\u2014at which point foreign companies can no longer compete. Hillman cites 5G networks as an example of an industry in which China dominates. \u201cYou start to see how big a problem it is to try to live in this world in which China owns more and more markets and you can\u2019t get in,\u201d she says. The United States has been the most vocal critic of Chinese trade practices, but other countries including European Union (EU) members and Japan share these concerns.\n\nHow has the United States responded?\n\nThe United States has attempted to address its trade concerns with China through a mixture of negotiation, disputes at the WTO, heightened investment scrutiny, tariffs, and its own industrial policy. The relationship has grown more combative over the past decade as U.S. policymakers have charted a progressively more assertive course. But experts including CFR senior fellow Edward Alden say the United States lacks effective policies for managing economic disruptions.\n\nAs part of China\u2019s entry into the WTO, U.S. negotiators demanded a temporary safeguard that could be used to limit imports from China, but this was hardly used before it expired twelve years later. Blustein writes that the George W. Bush administration was worried about cascading calls from U.S. companies for better protection and needed Beijing\u2019s support for other foreign policy objectives, including the global war on terrorism. The Bush administration imposed some tariffs on a range of Chinese goods that were subsidized or \u201cdumped\u201d (i.e., sold at an abnormally low price). It also launched high-level dialogues with China to address trade issues.\n\nThese dialogues continued under President Barack Obama, whose administration cracked down on Beijing. Obama used the special safeguard to impose tariffs on imported tires, and his administration won a number of WTO disputes against China, while blocking new appointments to the WTO\u2019s Appellate Body. Scrutiny of Chinese investment also increased, with Obama taking the rare step of blocking two Chinese acquisitions on the recommendation of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), an interagency body that screens investments on national security grounds. His administration also concluded negotiations for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a mega-regional trade agreement that it billed as a way to confront China on trade.\n\nPresident Donald Trump took an even more assertive approach, imposing tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods. Trump also withdrew from the TPP and negotiated a so-called Phase One agreement with China, which many experts criticized as punting on core U.S. concerns in exchange for a commitment by Beijing to purchase an additional $200 billion worth of U.S. goods\u2014which it failed to live up to. Trump also designated China as a currency manipulator for the first time in decades and maintained the Obama administration\u2019s block on new appointments to the WTO\u2019s Appellate Body, incapacitating the organization\u2019s dispute settlement system. Meanwhile, the U.S. Congress\u2014responding mainly to fears over Chinese acquisition of U.S. technology\u2014passed legislation expanding the role of CFIUS and tightening controls over high-tech exports.\n\nUnder President Biden, Washington has taken the most serious steps yet toward weakening China\u2019s play for economic dominance. He has signed legislation that could lead to the ban of China-owned social media giant TikTok; retained some $360 billion worth of tariffs as well as many sanctions applied by Trump on Chinese individuals associated with human rights abuses in Xinjiang and Hong Kong; introduced unprecedented export controls that restrict Beijing\u2019s ability to obtain advanced technology; and banned some U.S. investment in sensitive technologies that lawmakers fear could be used to aid China\u2019s growing military. He has also quadrupled tariffs on electric vehicles made in China, tripled those on steel and aluminum, and doubled the duty on semiconductors. Meanwhile, several U.S. governors have signed laws preventing state pensions from investing in equities controlled by the Chinese state.\n\nWhat lies ahead for U.S.-China trade?\n\nBiden\u2019s willingness to continue the economic confrontation with China has raised questions about the future of the trade relationship. Neither U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods (and retaliatory Chinese tariffs on U.S. exports) nor U.S. export controls has shown signs of being rolled back. Some legislators have introduced bills that would expand Biden\u2019s investment restrictions to include more Chinese industries; other proposed legislation would require federal government investment plans to divest from Chinese companies. The renewed pressure on TikTok marks another major escalation. Beijing calls the move \u201cbullying,\u201d and TikTok is suing the U.S. government, arguing that the forced sale is not feasible and violates the First Amendment.\n\nThe rise of China, as well as a new appreciation for the fragility of global supply chains laid bare by the COVID-19 pandemic, has contributed to the revival of industrial policy in the United States. The CHIPS and Science Act and Inflation Reduction Act, both passed in 2022, direct hundreds of billions of dollars to scientific research and domestic production of high-tech goods, such as semiconductors. Experts say the simultaneous efforts to impair competing Chinese industries, particularly export controls, could stifle China\u2019s semiconductor industry. Biden administration officials argue that these restrictions are part of a \u201csmall yard, high fence\u201d approach aimed at preserving national security, not a broader economic \u201cdecoupling.\u201d During a visit to China in August 2023, U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said that the United States believes \u201ca strong Chinese economy is a good thing.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, some experts have questioned whether the WTO system is sufficient to address U.S. grievances and whether China\u2019s economic model is fundamentally incompatible with global trading rules. The concept of a subsidy, for example, presupposes a bright line between the state and private industry that is increasingly blurry in China. In a 2022 report, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) said it has become \u201cwidely accepted in the United States that WTO rules do not, and cannot, effectively discipline many of China\u2019s most harmful policies and practices.\u201d That view has informed the decisions of both Democrat and Republican leaders to continue neutering the WTO.\n\nCFR\u2019s Hillman argues that allowing China into the WTO was not a mistake, but that the United States erred by failing to use the tools at its disposal to deter China\u2019s unfair trade practices sooner. Although the WTO remains a valuable forum for the United States, Washington might need to look elsewhere, Hillman says. Some experts have suggested a compact among like-minded countries that would function in parallel with the WTO. Politicians have advocated for more extreme options; Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO), for example, has called for abolishing the WTO altogether.\n\nHenry Gao, a professor at Singapore Management University and an expert on Chinese law and international trade, says that the use of unilateral tariffs damages the United States\u2019 image as a champion of free trade and cedes moral authority to China. Hillman and Gao agree that it was a mistake for U.S. leaders to assume that WTO membership would fundamentally change China. \u201cI would take a step back and ask: was the WTO even designed to convert countries\u2019 economic systems?\u201d Gao says. \u201cMy answer to that is no.\u201d Gao argues that China\u2019s model is unsustainable, and says that the United States should therefore be patient and work within the WTO, negotiating new rules as needed. \u201cIf you try to compete with China by becoming China, what is the point even if you win in the end?\u201d Gao says.",

However, Mr Biden's campaign chairwoman, Jen O'Malley Dillon, said the president had \"made his terms clear for two one-on-one debates, and Donald Trump accepted those terms\".\n\nTrump-Biden debates a 'shocker' says debate chairman\n\nMr Biden proposed two televised debates in June and September. His rival quickly accepted, before suggesting they debate every month.\n\n\"We believe there should be more than just two opportunities for the American people to hear more from the candidates themselves,\" the Trump campaign said.\n\nBoth candidates have traded barbs on social media, with Mr Trump stating: \"Just tell me when. Let's get ready to rumble!!!\"\n\nMr Biden said Mr Trump was \"free on Wednesdays\" - a reference to his criminal trial in New York, while Mr Trump claimed his rival was the \"worst debater\" who \"can't put two sentences together\".\n\nHow these debates break with tradition\n\nMr Biden's proposal of two debates breaks several established traditions.\n\nIt bypasses the presidential debate commission, which since 1988 has scheduled timings and had already set dates and locations for debates in the autumn. There are typically three such TV clashes.\n\nMr Biden's team wants the two debates to be conducted with no live audience - another break with tradition.\n\nCandidates would take turns answering questions from an agreed-upon moderator from a major news network, and the non-speaking candidate's microphone would be deactivated.\n\nMs Dillon said raucous partisan crowds were not \"conducive to good debates\".\n\nBut Mr Trump called for large audiences, saying \"it's just more exciting\" with a crowd.\n\nSpeaking to conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, he also said the debates should last two hours, and the two rivals should be required to stand for the duration.\n\nThe first 2020 forum between the two candidates was marred by frequent interruptions and cross-talk. The second was cancelled when Mr Trump caught Covid and refused to take part by video link.\n\nSeptember 2020: Trump and Biden clash on future of healthcare\n\nCan RFK qualify?\n\nCNN's rules state that participants must appear on enough state ballots to gain the minimum 270 electoral votes required to win a US presidential election, and they must receive at least 15% support in four separate recognised polls - a high bar for a third-party hopeful like Robert F Kennedy Jr.\n\nMr Kennedy's campaign says he is now officially on the ballot in six states and has collected enough signatures to qualify for the ballot in eight more. All those states combined bring him closer to the electoral threshold, but only to 185.\n\nHis latest polling figures also appear to be slightly below the CNN guidelines, even though he is polling better than any third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1996.\n\nCNN has not yet commented on his claims of qualifying.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday Mr Kennedy accused his opponents of trying to freeze him out \"because they are afraid I would win\". He has previously argued that White House elections are rigged in favour of the two main parties.\n\nMr Biden laughed when a reporter asked him on Wednesday if he wished to debate the independent candidate.\n\nWhy is the first debate so early?\n\nBy moving the debates earlier in the presidential campaign calendar, Mr Biden's proposal could lower any impact the TV clashes have on the outcome of the November presidential election, giving both candidates more time to recover from any poor performance.\n\nSome past incumbent presidents - including Mr Trump, Barack Obama, George HW Bush and Ronald Reagan - have had shaky showings in their first general election debate before regaining their footing in subsequent meetings.\n\nA June debate would take place before both the Republican and Democratic national conventions, while the September debate would be at least a month before election day. Surveys indicate many Americans do not begin paying attention to US presidential campaign news until the autumn.\n\nMr Biden also proposed a July vice-presidential debate that would take place after Mr Trump's running mate was nominated at the Republican convention in the summer.\n\nThe election-year presidential debates are typically broadcast on multiple US networks. At least 73 million Americans watched the first 2020 debate between Mr Trump and Mr Biden.\n\nMr Trump declined to participate in any Republican primary debates during this campaign, a point noted by Mr Biden in the video his campaign released announcing the debate proposal.",

        "text": "How to cope with political stress this election season\nKim Mills: It\u2019s May, and that means that Election Day is less than 6 months away. If just hearing that fact raises your blood pressure and sends your stress level through the roof, you are not alone. Back in 2022, APA\u2019s Stress in America poll found that 57% of people surveyed said that the 2024 presidential election was already a significant source of stress for them.\n\nThe same survey found that 76% of Americans believed that the future of our nation is a significant source of stress, and 66% were stressed by the current political climate. In fact, some recent research has found that just thinking about politics makes people anxious, stressed, and unhappy.\n\nSo how does political stress affect people\u2019s mental and physical well-being? Is it possible to stay politically engaged and follow the news while still maintaining your mental health? And if so, how? And what does this level of political stress mean for people\u2019s lives and for our country and for democracy as an institution? Welcome to Speaking of Psychology, the flagship podcast of the American Psychological Association that examines the links between psychological science and everyday life. I\u2019m Kim Mills.\n\nWe have two guests today. First is Dr. Brett Ford, an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Toronto and director of the Affective Science and Health Laboratory. There, Dr. Ford studies what people believe about emotions and how they regulate and manage their emotions. Since the 2016 election, she\u2019s been looking at how politics affect our emotions and how anxiety around politics drives people to engage or disengage with political action.\n\nOur second guest is Dr. Kevin Smith, a professor of political science at the University of Nebraska Lincoln. Dr. Smith studies the biology and psychology of individual differences in political attitudes and behavior, why some people are passionate about politics while others couldn\u2019t care less, where conservatives and liberals get their political beliefs from and how those beliefs drive choices and actions. In recent years, he\u2019s also been studying the effects of politics on people\u2019s health and well-being.\n\nThank you both for joining me today.\n\nBrett Q. Ford, PhD: Thanks for having us. I\u2019m glad to be here.\n\nMills: Now, you both study politics and emotion, but you came to these topics from different fields and perspectives. So I\u2019m going to ask you both to start by telling us a little bit about your background and why you got interested in politics. Dr. Ford, let\u2019s start with you.\n\nFord: Well, I started as a stress researcher, so I came at this from the sideways. I study how people manage stress, how people cope with different types of stressors in their lives. And circa 2016, it seemed like politics certainly qualified as a stressor. As the months and years unfolded, it seemed like maybe politics qualified as a chronic stressor. And so when we took that lens to it, it seemed like studying emotion regulation in the context of politics was an important direction for the work to go.\n\nMills: And, Dr. Smith, your background is political science. So what led you to these psychological questions?\n\nKevin Smith, PhD: Well, I was involved in a lot of quantitative genetic studies where we did some of the first studies looking at the heritability of political beliefs and attitudes. And we by now have a kind of mountain of evidence that even though it\u2019s a rather complex social phenotype, political attitudes and beliefs are fairly highly heritable. Which of course raises the question of how does that happen? How does genetics influence attitudes and behaviors?\n\nAnd one of the ways in which we were trying to answer that question is looking at sort of like biological information processing systems. And one of those systems, to make a long story short, was part of the autonomic nervous system, the fight or flight system where we were looking at levels of cortisol, which is popularly known as the stress hormone. And we found that people\u2019s cortisol levels are correlated to their political engagement. And that sort of got us to thinking, well, if engaging with politics is raising people\u2019s cortisol levels and we can observe that, is politics having a broader effect on their psychological, even physical health and certainly their social health? So that was kind of my launching point into it.\n\nMills: One could argue that almost everything controversial in life has political elements. Is the stress or anxiety that we feel related to electoral politics different from the stress or anxiety that we might feel from say, office politics or family politics?\n\nSmith: At least from my perspective, I think the short honest answer to that is we don\u2019t know\u2014the data that we have and we\u2019ve looked at it is consistent with the argument that politics is a unique chronic stressor in the environment and that people who are not particularly stressed or anxious about other parts of the social environment still seem to get stressed and anxious about politics. I hesitate to crawl out on a limb and declare that definitively, simply because at least as far as I\u2019m aware, there hasn\u2019t been a ton of study on that particular question.\n\nMills: Does that ring true for you, Dr. Ford?\n\nFord: I think it\u2019s useful to think about what politics shares with other forms of stress so we can triangulate our hypotheses and how we test our questions. It\u2019s certainly a multifaceted stressor, and so it includes, and that might be what makes it unique in the sense that it includes both these identity-based and group-based forms of stress. When we interact with people we don\u2019t like, that stresses us out. When we don\u2019t share values with other people, that stresses us out.\n\nThen there\u2019s also this superordinate structural level of stress that can come from politics, right? When you\u2019re facing systems that are much, much bigger than you and potentially feel like they are doing damage to you in some way or have the potential to, if the election doesn\u2019t work out in the way that you want it to. It reminds me a little bit of stress that\u2019s linked with being of lower socioeconomic status, right? These large intractable systems that seem to be working against you. So I think it\u2019s useful to draw on our knowledge about other stressors, but that at the end of the day, politics may be unique in the sense that it\u2019s this conglomeration of several really crucial forms of stress.\n\nSmith: And if I could just follow up on that, I agree 100% with everything that Brett just said. One of the other sort of unique aspects about politics is it\u2019s virtually impossible to avoid. Most of us have smartphones these days and it\u2019s literally in our pockets. I mean, you really, really have to work hard to avoid politics these days.\n\nMills: Well, Dr. Ford, you published a study last year in which you asked people to track their daily news consumption and their emotions and well-being. How does political news consumption affect people\u2019s stress levels, health and well-being?\n\nFord: We assume that people experience politics largely through their news consumption. We didn\u2019t necessarily constrain the study to that though. It could have been conversations that they had with people that they know. It was mostly just how are you learning about politics today? But I certainly expect a lot of that to come through the news and social media.\n\nAnd we found first of all that people\u2014and we did not recruit particularly special participants\u2014we found that participants were feeling stressed, feeling a variety of negative emotions about politics, at least 75%, 80% of the days that we asked them, and that they were feeling intense degrees of negative emotion on about half of the days that we assessed. Every other day, there\u2019s an intense negative emotional experience going on for people from across the political spectrum.\n\nMills: And, Dr. Smith, you\u2019ve done several national surveys on politics, stress, and health around the last two presidential elections. What did you find?\n\nSmith: Well, we asked our respondents a number of questions about how politics is affecting them psychologically, emotionally, socially, even their physical health. And what we found is that kind of astonishingly large percentages of Americans identify politics as a source of not just stress, but it is interrupting their sleep patterns. They sort of associate politics with\u2014I\u2019ve said things on social media or to people that I end up later regretting. I kind of compulsively follow some sort of social media news, that sort of thing.\n\nAnd two of our studies, we asked about suicidal ideation, and in both of those samples, 1 in 20 said that they\u2019d had thoughts of suicide associated with politics, which just astonished me. And if the estimates from our national surveys are even within the ballpark, I mean I think the short description is that politics is not being very good for the mental health of Americans and maybe not even their physical health.\n\nMills: How does political stress compare with other stressors in people\u2019s lives? I mean, that sounds pretty acute. Are politics as big a source of worry as money or health? I mean, we do surveys at the APA every year and we find money and health are way up there. Politics is on the list, but how do you find in your work where politics falls on the stress continuum?\n\nFord: I haven\u2019t looked specifically at those types of comparisons. If I were to speculate, part of what makes politics stressful is potentially the implications, the downstream implications that it has for personal outcomes. What is so upsetting about having someone in power who you don\u2019t agree with? It\u2019s largely because you think they\u2019re going to enact policies, laws, whatever that are going to impact you or the ones that you love. So perhaps in that sense it\u2019s a bit more distal than some of these moment to moment, I can\u2019t make ends meet today. But I do wonder if it is\u2014I liked the word continuum or spectrum. I imagine that these things are kind of falling along a spectrum and there aren\u2019t necessarily discrete categories, but that is speculation.\n\nSmith: And we\u2019ve come at it from a slightly different perspective in the sense that we have been looking at sort of diagnostic survey batteries for anxiety and stress that are general, and then we\u2019ve been trying to see whether measures of political stress and anxiety, are they sort of highly correlated with these? Can political stress still be an independent predictor or is it an independent predictor of these kind of negative emotional and psychological effects when you control for generalized anxiety? And generally speaking, at least in the data that we have so far, and we haven\u2019t done a ton on this, it seems to suggest that politics can be separable from more generalized measures of anxiety and stress. But we haven\u2019t looked at all about specific stressors. Are you worried about money or that sort of thing.\n\nMills: When it comes to election stress levels, do you find that there are say, partisan differences or differences between the sexes or other demographic factors?\n\nFord: We rarely find partisan differences in day-to-day experiences of stress about politics. And that\u2019s the study you referenced earlier where we kind of pinged people day after day, either two weeks or three weeks. And there aren\u2019t in that context partisan differences. Now when we zoom out and look at macro level events, we have some forthcoming work looking at the impeachments of Donald Trump at different points in the time course before the impeachment, the acquittal, impeachment, acquittal, and so forth. There are huge, huge partisan effects that track exactly as you think they would based on who kind of won or lost in a given context. So it\u2019s a really interesting pattern. It really depends on the context in which you\u2019re measuring those emotions, those macro level events where there are clear wins and losses, you see partisan differences that are very consistent, very strong. When you\u2019re asking people about day-to-day life, we\u2019re all kind of on an emotional rollercoaster it seems.\n\nSmith: In our research. I mean, we haven\u2019t looked, I mean we\u2019ve taken national samples and what we\u2019ve found fairly consistently in terms of the demographic factors that predict higher levels of these negative effects of politics, age is a big one. Younger people tend to suffer from these effects more than older people. We have found ideology to be a fairly consistent predictor with liberals tending to report more of this than conservatives. Gender\u2014I mean, we found some stuff, but it\u2019s kind of mixed and I wouldn\u2019t make anything definitive on that.\n\nBut two of the other things that we found consistent is that people who are interested in politics and paying attention to politics tend to suffer from this more or report more of this sort of stuff, which I guess isn\u2019t too surprising. The other thing that is I found really interesting is that people who do not like their partisan opposites, if you\u2019re a conservative who really doesn\u2019t like liberals and think they\u2019re lying and cheating, or if you\u2019re vice versa, you tend to report more stress and anxiety from politics. And I think those are the big sort of demographic predictors of this sort of thing that we\u2019ve found.\n\nMills: Now, United States citizens are certainly not alone in having a very fraught political atmosphere these days. What about people who live in countries where the head of state is absolute, in other words, a dictator, and people don\u2019t really have a choice as to who their leader is. Does that have any impact on whether people feel more or less stressed? Do we even know?\n\nSmith: As far as I know, maybe Brett knows something different, but I don\u2019t think we know, do we? Brett?\n\nFord: There\u2019s really interesting work being done in other cultures and other countries. There\u2019s several wonderful researchers who focus on emotion, emotion regulation and stress and group-based conflict in Israel. And I think to some degree, some of the patterns that we\u2019re talking about are kind of human patterns where something big and frightening happens, something threatening happens, it naturally evokes a response. But of course, people vary from each other, but on average there will be a response on average. People want to manage that stress. On average, humans are relatively resilient and we\u2019re actually pretty good at coping with stress on average, and yet there might be really important downstream consequences of managing that stress.\n\nThis is a question that I get semiregularly when I talk about work on how when you\u2019re really good at coping with the stress of politics, you\u2019re actually less likely to be engaged because emotions drive engagement. And people will ask, well, what about in countries where your engagement doesn\u2019t necessarily\u2014might not have the impact that it can in other countries that are more democratically oriented or in countries or locations where your action could directly jeopardize your health and well-being? What happens in those countries? And I say that work is really important and needs to be done, and I don\u2019t yet know of the work that has done it.\n\nMills: Have politics always provoked so much stress and anxiety in our culture, or is this new with the level of polarization we\u2019re seeing today? Or do we not even have the historical research to know?\n\nSmith: I don\u2019t think, I mean certainly in the sense of the kind of stuff that Brett and I are doing. I mean, I don\u2019t think we have research that goes back decades and decades to where we can sort of track it in a fine-grained way. But I mean, we\u2019ve gotten pretty upset and stressful and anxious about politics in the past. I mean, at one point we had a civil war, and I would imagine that that was pretty stressful and anxious for an awful lot of people. Certainly if you went back to the 1950s and the 1960s with some of the things that was going on with the civil rights movement, I\u2019m sure there was a lot of stress and anxiety around those sorts of things.\n\nBut are we in a new unique environment that is conducive to producing these sorts of emotional responses to politics? I mean, I think there\u2019s a reasonable argument that there is. I mean, everybody is blaming social media for everything these days, but I mean, the fact is it\u2019s a different information environment and a good deal of that information environment\u2014there\u2019s no gatekeeper, and it\u2019s specifically designed to provoke emotional responses. So in that sense, I would say that we\u2019re living in sort of a unique and different time, and that\u2019s even without talking about all the attendant things that go with a rerun of the 2020 election, which in and of itself was not just stressful, but if you listen to some of our subjects, kind of a traumatic event, it was. Yeah.\n\nMills: Well, Dr. Ford, one of the findings of your research is that when people are feeling anxiety or stress because of politics, there\u2019s strategies that can enable them to feel better. You just mentioned disengagement as one of them, but these strategies have trade-offs. Can you talk about that?\n\nFord: So given that our emotions help us do things, we have emotions for a reason. They help push us to take actions in the world. And our negative emotions also help us do things when we are angry, it helps us confront when we\u2019re anxious, it helps us take care of threats. And when we focus on getting rid of those emotions, and there\u2019s a variety of strategies that people use in their daily life to help manage these types of negative emotions that are really effective and useful and help promote mental health and even physical health, when we get rid of these emotions, sometimes we miss out on some of the benefits that those emotions provide us.\n\nAnd to the extent that they can help push us to be engaged and to stay motivated to take action when we lose them, we lose some of that motivation. And so the same strategies that help us get through the day and manage family stressors and money stress and things like that in really important ways can also help us in the context of politics. But then we find that the people who are very successful at using these strategies, they have better well-being in daily life, but they\u2019re the ones who are least likely to take action.\n\nSmith: And that is something that, especially as a political scientist, I find not just concerning, not just sort of super interesting, but really concerning. I mean, the findings that we\u2019ve come up with track exactly with what Brett is saying, is that negative emotion essentially motivates you to pay attention and get engaged civically. And if your way to deal with those negative emotions is to ignore the stuff that is producing those negative emotions, basically you civically disengage. And that\u2019s not healthy for democracy. I mean, Brett and I were having a little bit of a conversation earlier this week. It is sort of like the $64,000 question in our research is how do you get people to civically engage while still mitigating these sorts of effects? And yeah, I would really like to know the answer to that question.\n\nMills: Well, are there positive effects from being absorbed by politics, for instance? I mean, I\u2019ve been to a few national political conventions both as a reporter and later as an advocate, and I can tell you that the delegates and the other attendees seem really happy in this hyperpartisan milieu. Is that healthy?\n\nFord: Well, what is health? That\u2019s for another podcast. Yeah, I think you\u2019re exactly on the right track, and that\u2019s where our research is going and where hints in some ongoing research is pointing us as well. So when we focus on the negative emotions and getting rid of them, that\u2019s where we see these very consistent patterns of trade off. Because when we focus on the strategies that are really effective for getting rid of negative emotion, they often involve disengagement, tuning out, making things be less bad in our minds, which is super effective, right? Things not being such a big deal or it\u2019ll blow over or whatever. Those are really important strategies that we apply to other stressors in our lives, and it makes sense that that\u2019s part of our toolkit. But when we apply it to politics, that\u2019s maybe where we get into trouble because we start disengaging and tuning out.\n\nBut to your point, Kim, there are positive emotions too. And I don\u2019t talk about positive emotions to be a Pollyanna and say, let\u2019s all just put on rose-colored glasses and hold hands, and I don\u2019t know, sing Kumbaya, that\u2019s not really what it\u2019s about. It\u2019s not meant to be a denial of what is very stressful. It\u2019s actually the opposite. So we can let our negative emotions be, we don\u2019t have to make the situation be less bad. We don\u2019t have to make it be less severe, whatever. We can let that sit. We don\u2019t have to engage in the cognitive strategies to distort the situation to be something that it\u2019s not. We can let it be scary and frustrating and whatever, despairing, depending on who you are.\n\nBut it can also be an opportunity to connect with other people to have admiration or inspiration, to form these collective groups or have these collective experiences that can be uplifting and induce all sorts of other emotions. Compassion, pride, admiration, gratitude. Those emotions also drive political engagement. And so if we focus on cultivating those types of socially connected experiences, you get the benefit of feeling good, which in turn also helps keep you motivated. So that\u2019s I think, a really promising direction.\n\nSmith: And I think one of the things that a lot of people don\u2019t quite realize is there\u2019s a subsection of the population that really enjoys politics. I mean, they enjoy it as a contact sport. They like the conflict, they like to get involved. They like the self-satisfaction of being involved in a cause that they think is better than them and draw emotional sustenance from that. So yeah, I mean I think there are sort of positive emotions involved here, but there\u2019s a lot of individual level differences. I mean, the notion of getting up in front of people and going after someone who disagrees with you, and having that give and take\u2014to many people that would stress them out enormously. But for a lot of people involved in the political arena, it\u2019s like, Hey, yeah, that sounds like fun. Bring it on. Let me have some more of that.\n\nMills: Now, there\u2019ve been a lot of conversations so far this election year about how many voters are not happy with either of the presumptive major party presidential candidates. Is that an unusually stressful position to be in? Is it more or less stressful to feel like you have no good choice, at least at the top of the ticket?\n\nFord: It\u2019s not great.\n\nMills: No.\n\nFord: It\u2019s not a great situation. I mean, to the extent that it links up with other concepts that we know about learned helplessness, the idea that there\u2019s nothing you can do to really change things, because if you\u2019re perceiving either option as not so good, it sounds to me like a recipe for inaction and that\u2019s not going to be good for the country most likely.\n\nSmith: And even if it does prompt actions, probably a negative form of action. In other words, I\u2019m going to the polls not to vote for someone, I\u2019m going to the polls to vote against someone. There really isn\u2019t a choice here that I\u2019m going to feel good about. And I mean, I\u2019m not sure what that does to people psychologically, but I kind of doubt it makes them feel good.\n\nMills: Is your sense that it\u2019s more intense this year than in prior years? I mean, I know I always hear people saying I don\u2019t like either candidate, but I\u2019m going to vote or I\u2019m not going to do anything.\n\nSmith: Yeah, I mean, for a variety of different reasons, we have two uniquely unpopular major party candidates in the United States, and that does not make for a happy, isn\u2019t the future going to be great sort of mood amongst the electorate?\n\nMills: I want to go back, Dr. Smith, to something that you said right at the beginning about people\u2019s political bent being hereditary, in essence. Can you talk a little bit more about that and how we know, I mean, it\u2019s not so much that you would be necessarily a Republican or a Democrat, I mean, that parties are sort of made up constructs, but conservative and liberal, for example. Is that what we\u2019re talking about?\n\nSmith: Yeah, that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re talking about. And there\u2019s been a number of studies done over the past 20 or so years. The first one was done back in 1986, but nobody really picked up on it. But certainly since the early 2000. And a lot of these studies are twin studies, so they take advantage of the fact that there\u2019s\u2014identical twins are literally genetically identical. And fraternal twins, dizygotic twins share only about 50% of their genes. So in very, very rough terms, if identical twins are more like each other politically than fraternal twins, that\u2019s a prima fascia case.\n\nI mean, there\u2019s a lot of fancy statistics that can come into it, but that\u2019s the basic idea that if identical twins are more alike than fraternal twins, it\u2019s evidence that that trait is genetically influenced. But we also have adoption studies. People tend to be more politically like their biological parents than their adoptive parents. We have twins raised apart studies, and the twins tend to be more like each other. Now we have a genome-wide association scans that predict ideology. So there\u2019s a number of different ways that it\u2019s been triangulated. But the bottom line is ideology is not only heritable, it\u2019s more heritable than a lot of other psychological traits. I mean, the estimates vary, but on the low end it\u2019s 30% and on the high end it\u2019s 60%.\n\nMills: Next time you get a 23andme test, you\u2019ll find out whether you\u2019re liberal or conservative. But let me ask, because we\u2019re kind of getting into wrapping up here, whether you have advice that you want to leave our listeners with about how to manage their stress around the elections this summer and fall, because it\u2019s only going to ramp up, I\u2019m afraid.\n\nFord: My advice would be to not follow the common refrain of keep calm and carry on. I think that type of messaging reinforces the idea of if you\u2019re feeling bad, get rid of those feelings. It\u2019s okay for things to feel upsetting and just letting yourself sit with that and accept those feelings and accept the signals that they\u2019re providing you about how you feel about how things are and connect with people that you care about. Connect with people who share your values, connect with people who don\u2019t share your values. Provide yourself with opportunities to have moments of compassion and inspiration and pride and connection and love.\n\nAnd these things are not mutually exclusive. You can let the world be kind of a scary place and it can also be a beautiful place where you can connect with people. And through that balance, I think we can maintain a connection to our values, and those values can help keep us engaged and motivated to do our civic duties. And then these opportunities to connect with people help us maintain our mental health and well-being. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll try to do. I don\u2019t know, you can check back with me in a year.\n\nMills: All right.\n\nSmith: I think my response will make every poli sci 101 teacher really, really happy. I think one of the things that people can do is become better informed about the democratic process and the institutions of our political system. One of the things that we find is that people who are truly politically knowledgeable about what a representative democracy is, how it functions and what our institutions do, they tend consistently to report less of these negative effects than those who are less informed. And we think that part of what\u2019s going on there is if you understand the institutions and you understand how democracy works, democracy doesn\u2019t get rid of conflict, it just manages it. That\u2019s all it does. And the institutions in our system are set up to manage that conflict. And they\u2019ve taken a pretty good kicking over the past 5 to 6 years and you know what\u2014they\u2019ve held, they have more or less done their job.\n\nAnd I am pretty sure that the republic can survive the 2024 election regardless of what happens. And the reason why I can say something like that is because I not only understand the institutions, but have some faith in them and some faith in the process. And I think if people could, not in a Pollyanna-ish naive way, but in an informed way, gain some of that, I think that could take some of the edge off the anxiety and stress. What if I\u2019m a conservative and Biden wins, or if I\u2019m a liberal and Trump wins? You know what? Things will probably be okay. Not great, not great. I\u2019m not really not trying to be Pollyanna here. But we\u2019ll survive.\n\nMills: And this is really my last question. Are either of you or both of you doing any kind of research now related to the 2024 election specifically?\n\nFord: I am now! No, I mean, we need to understand what\u2019s going on, so it\u2019s certainly on our radar and we\u2019ll be stay tuned.\n\nMills: Okay.\n\nSmith: Yeah, and I\u2019m a political scientist, so it won\u2019t come as a shocker is\u2014absolutely, we\u2019re taking advantage of the 2024 election to redo some, to replicate some studies and also sort of investigate a few new avenues about how people are feeling about politics and dealing with it.\n\nMills: All right, well, we\u2019ll have to talk again. I want to thank you both for joining me today. This has been really interesting.

        "text": "From City Council to President, Women in Mexican Politics\nThis piece is based on remarks given by Dr. Roderic Ai Camp at the University of Nevada, which focused on the role of women in Mexican politics and elections over the last sixty years, with a specific focus on the current presidential election and the two leading candidates.\n\nMore women are running for office than any other election in Mexico\u2019s history. In the 2024 presidential race, the two leading politicians are women. Female politicians have been of personal interest to me since the early 1970s. Consequently, it is important to explore this topic from an historical perspective, hopefully shedding light on their role, including insights from numerous interviews I have been fortunate enough to have with successful female politicians in Mexico.\n\nAs some of you know, Mexico\u2019s culture generally, and in politics specifically, has reflected a dominant masculine influence, represented by the word machismo, a Spanish word which has become common-place in our own language. As is true elsewhere, women in Mexico were not allowed to vote until 1953. On the other hand, the Mexican Revolution of 1910 briefly opened up the possibilities for women to take on political roles. In fact, Frederick Turner argued in the 1960s that, \u201cWomen of all social classes in Mexico today look back on the Revolution of 1910 as the significant initiator of their political rights and their social emancipation.\u201d We have well-documented examples of women actively participating directly in the fighting, and in several cases, actually leading small cavalry guerrilla groups.\n\nMore directly related to political participation is the fact that Yucatan actually recognized their right to vote in 1922, resulting in three women elected to the state legislature and one to the city council.\n\nAt the national level, President Cardenas was able to get Congress to support female voting rights in the 1930s, but it was never enacted into law. In 1946, all women were allowed to vote in municipal elections. When I interviewed a prominent figure who was on the National Executive Committee of the National Revolutionary Party (predecessor of PRI) in the 1940s, he explained that the leadership was afraid to give women the vote because they would be likely to vote for conservative opposition candidates viewed positively by the Catholic Church. Interestingly, the first opportunity women had to vote for president was in the 1958 election, but only 48 percent did so.\n\nGeneral attitudes regarding the role of women in Mexico continued to impact the likelihood of their pursuing political careers. In the 1950s, a survey in Mexico City, revealed that 91 percent of men, and 90 percent of women, agreed with the statement that a woman\u2019s place was in the home. Such views were being passed on to the next generation, suggested by a 1960s survey of students, where 87 percent of boys, and 90 percent of girls, agreed with this statement. But those attitudes went far beyond just the generalized attitudes among males and females in Mexico. Those biases were even more definitive in the legal system.\n\nIn the pre-democratic era of Mexican politics, women slowly began to achieve positions in all branches of government. Interestingly, in the Mexican case, women first achieved important public offices nationally through the judicial branch. The first woman to serve in the Federal Court of Appeals was appointed in 1947. It is worth noting that while a number of women achieved positions in the lower judicial levels through the 1970s, the judicial branch did not exercise considerable political influence.\n\nIn Mexico, the executive branch exercises the most political influence. In fact, it has been so influential compared to the legislative branch, that the Mexican public generally, and politicians specifically, have a dismissive attitude toward the institution.\n\nI can illustrate this attitude from my own personal experience. In 2003, I was invited to give a presentation to all of the PRI members of Congress in Puebla, Mexico. After the presentation, my wife and I were invited to dinner by a friend who was a three-time member of Congress. During our dinner in a prominent restaurant, an official from the staff of the governor of Puebla approached our table, and told me that the governor had invited us to dinner. Although it was obvious, I explained that we already were eating dinner with my friend. He left, and then returned twice. I considered him to be rude, but understood he was obeying the wishes of the governor. He kept saying, \u201cbut sir, this is the governor,\u201d as if I didn\u2019t understand this political protocol. I explained that we were eating with my best friend in Puebla, a member of Congress, and to convey that to the Governor. This, of course, illustrates the attitudes among political office-holders at that time.\n\nWhy is it crucial that Mexican women obtain influential positions in the executive branch, rather than in the legislative or judicial institutions? If we examine the period from 1952 to 1976, only 3 women held top executive positions. The first woman to be appointed to the level of assistant-secretary was selected for that position in 1970 in the Secretariat of Public Education.\n\nEssentially, the typical path to top decision-making posts in Mexican cabinets, requires experience in the executive branch. In a study of more than 900 cabinet secretaries from 1958 to 2012, my colleague and I found evidence of gender discrimination in executive appointments, especially in agencies which never had a female secretary or assistant secretary. Ironically, women had greater policy expertise, based on professional experience and education, and stronger political skills based on electoral experience and political party leadership.\n\nIt is worth noting that women politicians in Mexico relied heavily on family connections than did men, an influential source of future politicians. Furthermore, women, similar to men, also rely heavily on personal connections other than family. A former Assistant Secretary of Human Rights and Democracy in the Secretariat of Foreign Relations, Mariclaire Acosta Urquidi, told me \u201cI think that in my experience, the fact that influential people knew my work, were key factors (beyond her family).\u201d\n\nOne of the most dramatic changes in Mexican politics was the introduction of gender parity in the legislative branch in 1996, and strengthened in 2002. This pattern became national at comparable levels when a 2014 constitutional reform guaranteed gender parity for all legislatures. By the beginning of Lopez Obrador\u2019s administration, Mexico ranked eighth in the world in the percentage of women in the legislative branch. It might surprise many of you to learn that Mexico was far ahead of the United States in their appointments to top judicial posts. The first female justice (Maria Cristina Salmoran de Tamayo) of the Supreme Court took office in 1961, twenty years before Sandra Day O\u2019Connor became the first female justice in the U.S.\n\nThese achievements in the legislative and judicial branches are noteworthy in increasing women\u2019s involvement in national political leadership. Even more important, however, is for women to serve in top cabinet positions, and equally significant, in those cabinet agencies which are the most influential politically and in public policy. Calderon was the first president to open top cabinet posts to women. Midway through his presidency in 2009, women were in charge of Public Education, Tourism, Energy, and Foreign Relations. As of 2018, only one woman, Josefina Vazquez Mota, a two-time cabinet secretary, became a presidential candidate of a major political party, the PAN. In 1994, however, Cecilia Soto Gonzalez ran for president representing the Labor Party. She was the first female presidential candidate to win a million votes. By the beginning of Lopez Obrador\u2019s administration, twenty different women had served in 22 posts as cabinet secretaries. AMLO, has taken this pattern to a new level, appointing the first gender-parity cabinet, and women to top agencies.\n\nIf we take note of top executive experience at the state level, as governors, only seven women have served in that position.\n\nWhy is it important to understand female representation at these different levels and in different branches of government? In Mexico, most presidential candidates have had experience as governors or cabinet secretaries. How do all of these patterns affect the two leading candidates in the 2024 elections?\n\nClaudia Sheinbaum, the former mayor of Mexico City (2018-2023), is the leading candidate as of April, representing Morena (National Regeneration Movement), the party founded by Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (AMLO). Not only has she attracted attention as a female candidate, and if elected, would be the first female president in Mexico, she would be the first Jewish candidate. Her parents are both Jewish and scientists (father a chemist) and (mother a biologist). Her grandparents immigrated to Mexico from Lithuania and Bulgaria. Sheinbaum graduated from the National Autonomous University in Mexico City with a degree in physics. This university has produced more national politicians, and more presidents of Mexico, than any other institution. She completed a Ph.D. at the Lawrence Berkeley National Library in California (1991-94), and was a serious researcher, having published many articles and two books on energy and the environment and sustainable development. Her political career began with an active involvement in student politics at UNAM. She served as the Secretary of Environment of the Federal District under Lopez Obrador from 2000-2006. In 2015, she became mayor of Tlalpan in Mexico City.\n\nHer opponent, X\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez, leads a coalition of the National Action Party (PAN), the Institutional Revolution Party (PRI) and the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), known as the Broad Front for Mexico. In addition to being a woman, she is the daughter of an indigenous father and a mixed-race mother. She was born in Tepatepec, Hidalgo, a community including Otomi indigenous Mexicans. Her father is Otomi, and her mother is part Otomi. If elected, she would be the first president since the 19th century (Benito Juarez) from an indigenous background. In addition, she is from a modest background, and worked as a child selling desserts to help her family.\n\nShe eventually attended the National University of Mexico, where she earned a degree in computer engineering. She eventually founded her own company (OMEI), which is involved in intelligent infrastructures. She created a foundation to help mothers and children suffering from malnutrition in indigenous areas. In 2000, President Fox appointed her to direct the National Institute of Indigenous Peoples, where she served until 2006. In 2010, she ran for governor of Hidalgo from a coalition of parties, barely losing with 47 percent of the vote. From 2015-2018, she was mayor of Miguel Hidalgo in Mexico City. In 2018, she was elected as a senator from PAN, serving until 2023.\n\nAlthough Sheinbaum appears likely to win the presidential race as suggested by recent election polling, the election process itself reveals a number of conditions which may produce significant consequences for democracy in Mexico. The election will take place on June 2nd. In addition to the presidency, there will be elections for all members of Congress, for 9 governors, for the mayor of Mexico City, and for 31 state legislatures. There are currently 98 million voters.\n\nThe National Electoral Institute (INE), which is responsible for Mexico\u2019s election, has established clear guidelines for funding the presidential campaigns. Legally, monies must come from government funding, not private sources. Since 1996, the Constitution requires that parties are assigned funding on the basis of a formula designed to promote fairness in the elections, with 70 percent distributed based on the percentage of votes each party received, and 30 percent equally to all parties regardless of size, as well as an assigned amount for independent candidates.\n\nIn 2024, 612 million dollars will be spent on public funding. Each party may accept up to a total of 7 million dollars from their own \u2018party members; 2.5 million from supporters, and 2 million from individuals. It\u2019s revealing to know that parties must allocate at least 3 percent of the total amount they received for ordinary activities to the training, promotion, and development of political leadership of women. INE is required to audit these donations before the campaign begins.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, Mexico will have a female president, clearly demonstrating that the future of female politicians nationally will continue to be successful. Ironically, many women in the past relied on experience at the local level to establish successful political careers. To achieve comprehensive success in public life, they will need to replicate comparable achievements at the gubernatorial level.",

        "text": "Potential Impacts of the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election on Supply Chains\nAs the world braces for the 2024 U.S. presidential election, the possible ripple effects on global trade and supply chains keep procurement professionals on edge. Let\u2019s see if we can draw upon recent historical data to forecast potential outcomes of the upcoming election on supply chain management.\n\nHistorical trends and predictions\n\nPresidential elections have historically been a harbinger of change, often bringing about policy shifts that can fortify or destabilize global trade networks. The last two presidential campaigns brought forth a slew of related predictions, ranging from the renegotiation of trade agreements to the imposition of tariffs.\n\nHowever, the actual outcomes were sometimes less dramatic than anticipated, while at other times, they were overshadowed by unforeseen global events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nImpacts of the first Trump administration on supply chains\n\nThe first Trump administration was characterized by bold policies that left an indelible mark on global supply chains.\n\nLet's explore the most important ones:\n\nTariffs War with China and the \u201cTrade Deal\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration took an aggressive stance on trade, mainly through the Section 301 tariff war with China, which imposed a 10% and later 25% import tax on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of Chinese imports to revive American manufacturing, reduce the trade deficit, and get China to agree to a new trade deal.\n\nThe actual impact was multifaceted, leading to a complex web of trade realignments.\n\nOne study showed that Trump\u2019s trade policies with China resulted in American companies shifting their supply from China to other Asian countries like Bangladesh, Hong Kong, India, and Taiwan, which increased the costs in their supply chains.\n\nDeregulation of the energy and financial sectors\n\nThe Trump administration also designed a series of deregulation policies in the energy and financial sectors to reduce operational costs and foster economic growth. These changes impacted supply chain managers within the renewable energy sector as they navigated a new landscape where traditional energy sources were gaining prominence again.\n\nCOVID-19 response\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic presented an unprecedented challenge to supply chains worldwide. The Trump administration\u2019s response, which included a mix of travel restrictions and economic stimulus measures, had a varied impact. Some initiatives provided much-needed relief to disrupted supply chains, while others may have inadvertently intensified the strain on these critical networks.\n\nImpacts of the first Biden administration on supply chains\n\nThe Biden administration\u2019s policies have continued to shape the global supply chain landscape.\n\nThe U.S. CHIPS and Science Act and semiconductor supply chains\n\nThe U.S. CHIPS and Science Act, highlighted by Gartner , represents a significant pivot towards bolstering domestic semiconductor production. This legislation has not only shifted semiconductor supply chains from Asia to the U.S. Still, it has also positioned Mexico as a burgeoning manufacturing hub for various goods destined for the American market.\n\nBiden\u2019s policies on climate action\n\nPresident Biden\u2019s commitment to climate action has had a tangible impact on the oil and gas industries in the U.S. while simultaneously catalyzing the growth of renewable energy sectors and electric vehicles. These policies have redefined the energy supply chain in the U.S., with long-term implications for sustainability and economic viability.\n\nContinued tariff policies\n\nMany supply chain managers expected the Biden administration to eliminate the tariffs on Chinese imports imposed by President Trump in 2018-2019. For American businesses, restoring business as usual with the Asian giant would have meant reconnecting with cheaper Chinese suppliers. However, this never happened, despite some analysts considering President Biden\u2019s stance on China\u2019s economic growth as weak.\n\nWhat if President Biden wins the 2024 U.S. presidential election?\n\nAs President Biden gears up for the 2024 U.S. presidential election, his administration\u2019s proposals could significantly influence global supply chains, particularly concerning China.\n\nThese are President Biden's main proposals:\n\nWorking with partners to combat China\u2019s growing economy\n\nBiden\u2019s approach to China involves strengthening alliances and partnerships to present a united front against China\u2019s economic practices deemed unfair. This strategy could lead to more coordinated international efforts to balance China\u2019s growing influence and could impact global supply chains by creating new trade blocs and agreements.\n\nInvesting in developing alternative supply chains\n\nDuring his campaign, President Biden has repeatedly stressed the need to diversify supply chains away from China. This could mean increased investment in other regions, including, but not limited to, Mexico.\n\nCrackdown on Chinese industrial espionage and bolster data security\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that China invests heavily in industrial espionage. One survey from the Center for Strategic and & International Studies (CSIS) found that 54% of Chinese espionage incidents since 2000 sought to steal commercial technologies, while 29% targeted military technology.\n\nBiden proposes cracking down on industrial espionage and enhancing data security measures. This could lead to tighter regulations and controls on technology transfers, impacting companies with supply chains intertwined with Chinese tech industries.\n\nWhat if President Trump wins the 2024 U.S. presidential election?\n\nFormer President Trump\u2019s potential return to office brings forth proposals that could drastically alter the landscape of international trade and supply chains:\n\n60% tariff on all Chinese imports and 10% on everything else\n\nIn his campaign for the 2024 U.S. presidential election, Trump has proposed increasing tariffs on all Chinese imports to 60%. Such a significant hike could escalate trade tensions and prompt companies to seek alternative sourcing options.\n\nTrump also proposes a 10% blanket tariff on all other imports. This policy could increase production costs and cause companies to reevaluate their global sourcing strategies.\n\nUndoing most or all of the Biden administration\u2019s climate actions\n\nWithdrawing from the Paris Accord and reversing climate actions taken by the Biden administration could have profound implications for industries related to renewable energy and sustainability, affecting supply chains focused on these sectors while bolstering supply chains for oil and gas.\n\nThe 2024 U.S. presidential elections: A focus on China\n\nThe 2024 U.S. presidential elections present a pivotal moment for global supply chains, with China at the forefront of the discourse. Supply chain managers must prepare for various scenarios that may unfold post-election.\n\nTools like BabelusAI can assist procurement professionals in discovering new suppliers, fostering more resilient and diversified supply chains that can withstand the uncertainties of political shifts.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "2024 Presidential Ticket Comparison & Evaluation\nThe Trump-Vance Ticket\n\nThe Trump-Vance presidential ticket is a stark contrast to the Biden-Harris ticket. Both former Donald Trump and J.D. Vance have gained attention for their positions on various social and political issues, often sparking debate about the impact of those positions on civil rights. Trump, the 45th President of the United States, is a businessman and media personality known for his polarizing and incendiary rhetoric, which has often been criticized for undermining civil rights and social justice efforts.\n\nIn May 2024, Trump was convicted on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in connection with hush money payments made to his alleged mistresses during his 2016 presidential campaign. For one and a half years, Vance has served as the junior U.S. Senator from Ohio. He is the author of \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d and he is known for his commentary on the struggles of the white working class and his critique of what he refers to as the liberal elite.\n\nDonald Trump\n\nLegislative Record: during his tenure as president, Trump focused on strict immigration policies, such as the travel ban and family separations, and an emphasis on law and order, including efforts to limit police reform. He signed the First Step Act, a criminal justice reform measure aimed at reducing recidivism and improving prison conditions. The legislation was championed by a bipartisan group of lawmakers, including key lead sponsors Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Representative Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY). Despite this act, Trump\u2019s administration saw the rollback of several civil rights advances, including protections for LGBTQ+ individuals and challenges to voting rights expansions. These actions have been widely criticized for undermining civil rights.\n\nAdvocacy: Trump\u2019s advocacy and rhetoric has often been criticized as racist, with several high-profile incidents illustrating this perception. Following the violence white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017, Trump faced widespread condemnation for stating that there were \u201cvery fine people on both sides,\u201da remark seen as equating white supremacists with anti-racism counter-protestors.\n\nIn 2019, he attacked the city of Baltimore, calling it a \u201cdisgusting, rat and rodent infested mess,\u201da comment many interpreted as racially changed against the predominately Black city. Similarly, Trump\u2019s law-and-order rhetoric during protests in Milwaukee and other cities following the murder of George Floyd often targeted Black Lives Matter activists and was seen as dismissive of the systemic racism in law enforcement being protested.\n\nConversely, his repeated reluctance to unequivocally condemn white supremacists, notably during a presidential debate in 2020 where he told the white supremacist terrorist organization \u2018Proud Boys\u2019 to \u201cstand back and stand by,\u201dfurther cemented his reputation for enabling racist ideologies.\n\nJames David \u201cJ.D.\u201d Vance\n\nLegislative Record: albeit brief, Vance\u2019s legislative record is marked by efforts to limit diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, which he has stated he views as divisive. He co-sponsored the \u2018Dismantle DEI Act\u2019, which aims to eliminate all federal DEI programs and funding for federal agencies, contractors, and educational institutions. He has supported legislation that critics argue promotes hate and division, such as opposing the teaching of Black history in schools and resisting federal mandates for racial sensitivity training.\n\nAdvocacy: due to his legislative efforts and public statements, Vance\u2019s advocacy has been criticized as anti-civil rights. When asked about \u2018Project 2025\u2019, the right-wing policy agenda rooted in white supremacist ideology, Vance stated that he believed it was full of \u201cgood ideas.\u201d",

        "text": "Bolivia: Two candidates, one party\nBolivia is a landlocked country in South America that has been experiencing political unrest that began after the ousting of former President Evo Morales in 2019, amidst allegations of electoral fraud. An interim government was instituted.\n\nIn 2020 Morales\u2019 party, the Movimiento al Socialismo (MAS) or Movement Toward Socialism, returned to power with the election of Luis Arce, an economist and banker who was credited with economic transformation during Morales\u2019 presidency, which renationalized Bolivia\u2019s thriving hydrocarbons industry, redistributed agricultural land, increased taxes on the wealthy, and lifted many members of the country\u2019s Indigenous population out of poverty.\n\nAfter Arce came to power, a bitter fight ensued with Morales, who has since become his rival. The rift threatens to split MAS. Now, Morales has vowed to run against Arce in the 2025 presidential elections furthering widening the political rift within the MAS.\n\nJohn Twichell, lecturer and director of Latin American Studies at the University of Miami College of Arts and Sciences, explains more about Bolivia\u2019s present state.\n\nWhat are the economic challenges the country has faced?\n\n\n\nBolivia currently faces major economic challenges that originate in its still contested late-20th-century methods of neoliberal reform which oversaw marketization and privatization of its productive sectors to the benefit of elites and foreign capital, but to the detriment of most of the Bolivian people. In addition to the disputed privatization of such utilities as water underscored by the Cochabamba Water War of 2000, the natural gas sector stands out for its market-driven expansion by means of foreign investment followed by its nationalization under President Evo Morales by way of decree in 2005. For the next 10 years, Bolivia\u2019s increasingly natural gas export revenue-dependent economy benefitted greatly from resource nationalism as a development strategy thanks to a commodities boom in international markets driven by China\u2019s industrialization indicated by steady GDP growth. Natural gas export revenue windfalls generated a fiscal surplus and foreign currency reserves surplus that grew to $15 billion by 2014, funding MAS\u2019 generous redistribution policies and social sector expansion.\n\nBy then heavily reliant on imports to provision the bulk of the economy, a fixed exchange rate of 6.96 bolivianos to the U.S. dollar was adopted in 2011 to maintain price stability. Since its peak in 2014, this model has grown increasingly difficult for the government to maintain, due in large part to precipitous declines in natural gas resources combined with deferred investment and an extended period of relatively lower international prices. The result is observable in a balance of payments deficit. U.S. dollar reserves have declined to dangerously low levels of a few hundred million, the Bolivian Central Bank is now imposing currency controls, domestic businesses are not able to access U.S. dollars to pay for goods they need to import, and there is a growing consensus among financiers and the general public who are lining up at banks to withdraw dollars that Bolivia can no longer maintain its fixed exchange rate, prompting fears of currency devaluation, inflation, and perhaps even a return to its bleak history of hyperinflation. In response, the Arce government has stepped up efforts to develop its lithium export sector through foreign investment mainly by China while it also expands natural gas exploration into once environmentally protected spaces, some of which are home to indigenous peoples.\n\nWhat is the present political climate in Bolivia right now?\n\n\n\nThe present day political climate in Bolivia is defined by extremism, polarization, and turbulence, due partly to the economic situation noted above, yet due even more so to fallout still surrounding the October 2019 presidential elections when the incumbent at the time Evo Morales \u2014 who ignored 2016 referendum results in which Bolivians rejected his efforts to run for reelection to a fourth term\u2014and MAS in general faced immediate charges of electoral fraud by the opposition which unleashed widespread protests. The Organization of American States also questioned the integrity of the October 2019 election. In subsequent days, political maneuvering by the opposition, a conspicuous absence of MAS faithful willing to defend Morales out in the streets, along with military and police desertion of Morales himself, ultimately led Morales, at the suggestion of the military, to resign as president and flee Bolivia into exile in Argentina, immediately declaring himself the victim of a coup.\n\nIn the midst of institutional chaos, conservative outlier Jeanine \u00c1\u00f1ez, a senator from the department of Beni, emerged from obscurity to declare herself next in line to lead a transitional government as de facto president. Overshadowed by continuing violent protest in its early days which she was convicted of brutally repressing, \u00c1\u00f1ez\u2019s transitionary term coincided with the onset of the pandemic and an ensuing failure to address its effects. Nonetheless, \u00c1\u00f1ez declared herself a candidate for the 2020 special presidential election, which she lost to Luis Arce of MAS, Morales\u2019 former economy minister.\n\nAlso important, Bolivia\u2019s political climate is greatly influenced by its unitary form of government and a stark geographical political-economic divide between the federal capital of La Paz and the pro-market agro-industrial stronghold department of Santa Cruz with its capital of Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia\u2019s most populated city, which has experienced significant economic and population growth over the past decade. In response, business and government leaders of Santa Cruz are leveraging that growth to demand a greater share of distribution of federal tax revenues, which culminated in protests, strikes, and roadway blockades\u2014a common political tactic in Bolivia\u2014after the Arce government sought to delay the 10-year census due in 2023; but then, by legislative mandate, it ultimately acquiesced to by carrying out the census this past March with the highly anticipated results expected to be released in September.\n\nWhat has happened to the MAS party of former president Morales and what role do they play in today\u2019s government?\n\n\n\nSince the 2020 special election and the return of MAS to the role of executive under Arce, Morales came out of exile back to Bolivia and resumed his role as party leader and main conspirator which has pitted the two former allies and their respective faithful against each other\u2014the evistas versus the arcistas\u2014and led to an incredible rupture within MAS.\n\nA 1990s political movement with its origins in reaction to the detrimental impacts of neoliberalism, and widely considered to be more of a \u201cbig tent\u201d encompassing social movement that gained its momentum and strength by drawing together a variety of interest groups and social movements representative of Bolivia\u2019s range of geographical, urban-rural, and identity-based cleavages, MAS is revealing itself to be resistant to party discipline. This, even though, it has achieved ostensible single party rule. Morales\u2019 declaration of himself as challenger to Arce as MAS candidate in the 2025 presidential election, followed by the Constitutional Court\u2019s December 2023 decision prohibiting Morales from running as a candidate\u2014reversing a prior court\u2019s ruling that reelection is a fundamental human right\u2014has only exacerbated the MAS rift, with some of its most important interest group supporters now siding with Morales against Arce in the ongoing leadership dispute. In summary, division and fragmentation within MAS suggest it will go into the 2025 election weakened and at a political disadvantage against the opposition, especially if economic conditions continue to worsen.\n\nWhat kind of human rights abuses have been carried out by the government since 2019?\n\n\n\nHuman rights abuses, accusations of them and charges and convictions related to them point back to the presidential election of October 2019 and ensuing weeks and months, when as many as 36 were killed and many others were injured during mass protests in the first days of \u00c1\u00f1ez\u2019s government. Accusations came to light and charges of terrorism were brought forth by the Arce government in the \u201cGolpe I\u201d case against both \u00c1\u00f1ez and Luis Fernando Camacho, governor of Santa Cruz.\n\n\u00c1\u00f1ez has since been convicted and was sentenced to 10 years in prison while Camacho, ever since his shocking Dec. 28, 2022 arrest, has been held in pretrial detention inside the notoriously harsh Chonchocoro prison located in the highlands outside of La Paz. Camacho, a candidate in the 2020 presidential election, is widely considered to be the main leader of the political opposition and its leading presidential candidate to represent the right-wing Creemos party in the 2025 election. Camacho\u2019s supporters have protested his arrest and refer to it as \u201ckidnapping\u201d intended to instill fear in the opposition.\n\nNotably, Human Rights Watch, in its \u201cBolivia: Events of 2023\u201d report, after reviewing the charging documents of both \u00c1\u00f1ez and Camacho, declared \u201cthe terrorism charge unsubstantiated and grossly disproportionate\u201d in the former, and found \u201cno supporting evidence for the terrorism charge\u201d in the latter case. In summary, the dangerously polarized nature of politics in Bolivia appears to have overshadowed the protection of basic human rights irrespective of political alignment.\n\nWhy is Bolivia characterized as a country where political interference in the justice system is common?\n\n\n\nPolitical interference in Bolivia\u2019s judiciary is widely acknowledged and not bound to any political party, with many judges and prosecutors in temporary positions. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, following a 2023 on-site observation of its judicial processes and institutions, declared Bolivia\u2019s judiciary to operate subservient to the \u201cinterests of the ruling political power,\u201d also referred to by political scientists as the tactic of \u201clawfare\u201d or legal warfare.\n\nIn that vein, accusations have been made by the opposition that \u00c1\u00f1ez, Camacho, and more than one hundred other political, military, and police leaders are being held as political prisoners in connection with the events of late-2019. Meanwhile, the current Minister of Justice Ivan Lima dismisses such claims and defends the government\u2019s obligation to pursue justice for the victims killed in the protests mentioned above.\n\nStill, setting aside the cases tied to late-2019, it seems hard to defend a system that holds more than half of its detainees in pretrial detention against a judicial backdrop that lacks independence. Repeated delays in the scheduling of elections of judges to the high courts\u2014delays being imposed by MAS while it lacks the two-thirds majority in Congress needed to unilaterally select candidates\u2014casts further doubt on the impartiality of this branch of the federal government in Bolivia.",

This safe harbor is in lieu of obtaining direct cost information from suppliers. The guidance also amends\u00a0last May\u2019s Notice to add more safe harbor classifications, including the addition of hydropower technologies, as well as to provide clarity for rooftop solar.Treasury and IRS continue to consider stakeholder comments and plan to issue further domestic content guidance to address issues not in the scope of this guidance, including adding further sectors, including offshore wind, to the new elective safe harbor table and issuing proposed rules for projects using elective pay (sometimes referred to as direct pay).

        "text": "In a Democracy, No One Is Above the Law. The US Supreme Court Has a Responsibility to Uphold this Principle\nWith former president Donald Trump facing criminal charges in four separate federal and state cases, much has been said about the \u201cunprecedented\u201d nature of this moment: never before has a US president or former president been criminally indicted\u2014even if a few came very close.\n\nTrump\u2019s supporters have seized on that novelty to portray the indictments as illegitimate, comparing them to the strong-arm tactics of dictators. In fact, criminal indictment of political leaders is relatively common among democracies: 43 percent of the countries rated Free in Freedom House\u2019s Freedom in the World report have prosecuted current or former heads of state or government since 2000. This includes the leaders of fellow democracies like France, Israel, and Austria, who were either political candidates or in office at the time, according to our new analysis.\n\nWhile such cases are always politically controversial, and carry risks, that has not stopped independent justice systems in many of the world\u2019s freest countries from pursuing and managing cases credibly. Democracies can emerge stronger from such events by demonstrating to citizens that the rule of law applies to everyone, and that democratic institutions are working as intended. The United States has everything it needs to handle former president Trump\u2019s court cases credibly and work within the system to determine his guilt or innocence. The Supreme Court, for its part, should uphold the fundamental democratic principle that no one is above the law.\n\nRising to the challenge\n\nCan the United States, like many other democracies, fairly and credibly prosecute and try a former president and current presidential candidate? The signs point to yes.\n\nAmerica\u2019s judicial independence, rule-of-law tradition, and constitutional protections for the accused are among its most deeply embedded strengths as a democracy. Its law enforcement authorities and courts have credibly handled hundreds of criminal charges against senior politicians from both major parties, irrespective of the political implications. They continue to do so, with the federal indictment and trial on corruption charges of Senator Robert Menendez, a powerful member of the Democratic Party, as a recent example.\n\nThe United States also has robust protections against the politicization of prosecutions\u2014from constitutional due process protections and independent courts that serve as a crucial check on prosecutors, to independent grand juries that review and approve indictments, to federal and state standards that forbid prosecutors from charging, or failing to charge, a case based on its political implications.\n\nIn short, notwithstanding the inherent controversy surrounding the indictments against former president Trump, Americans have good reasons to trust that the US criminal justice system will manage them fairly and credibly.\n\nBut this trust need not be blind. Independent media and other analysts, acting in good faith, should scrutinize cases carefully and report objectively on how the potential for real or perceived political bias is being managed\u2014noting institutional safeguards in place and ask probing questions about how they are working. In doing so, however, they should always bear in mind that the mere existence of political implications or consequences stemming from a case does not indicate an improper political motivation. To the contrary, if a democracy\u2019s most senior political leaders were never subjected to legal scrutiny and accountability\u2014as in an autocratic state like Russia or China\u2014there would be far more reason to worry.\n\nThe dangers of immunity\n\nDespite America\u2019s institutional strengths, there remains ambiguity about the extent to which presidents enjoy immunity from criminal prosecution, if at all, for actions they take while in office. US Department of Justice policy prohibits prosecution of a sitting president, but that policy does not have the full force of law and remains subject to considerable constitutional debate. Lower courts recently ruled that any criminal immunity is lifted after a president leaves office, but the Supreme Court is currently considering an appeal on that question in the case of Trump v. United States, with a ruling due next month. Trump\u2019s lawyers argue that former presidents enjoy absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for their official actions unless they have first been impeached and convicted by Congress.\n\nThe Supreme Court should reject such dangerous arguments and clarify that presidents are not above the law. The defense of this principle is crucial in any genuine democracy, and it is particularly vital when illegal abuses of power threaten the democratic order itself. Given the facts of the current case, which centers on a former president\u2019s alleged involvement in a months-long effort to interrupt the peaceful transfer of power after a free and fair presidential election, the stakes could scarcely be higher.\n\nHowever the details of the case might play out at an eventual trial, with all the rights and due process protections the former president will be afforded, to quash the matter entirely by granting immunity from prosecution would do severe damage to both the rule of law and the integrity of elections in the United States. It would signal that future presidents may freely commit crimes while in office so long as they have enough allies in Congress to block accountability through impeachment. It would also deal a major blow to US-led efforts to counter authoritarianism around the world, as a group of retired military generals and senior defense officials argued in an amicus brief.\n\nThankfully, despite the country\u2019s deep political polarization, Americans support the principle that no one is above the law. In a recent national poll, 70 percent of respondents said they do not believe that US presidents should be immune from prosecution for crimes they allegedly committed while in office. Even as they vehemently disagree over who their next president should be, Americans are overwhelmingly in agreement about presidential immunity, and they are counting on the Supreme Court to ensure that any president who engages in criminal behavior can be brought to justice.",

        "text": "Biden and Trump agree to presidential debates on June 27 and Sept. 10\nWashington \u2014 President Biden and former President Donald Trump will go head-to-head in presidential debates on June 27 and Sept. 10, with the two White House hopefuls accepting invitations from CNN and ABC News to participate in the events after a flurry of activity on Wednesday.\n\nPlans for the debates came together quickly after the president's campaign said in a letter that he was willing to debate his Republican opponent twice before the November election. That kicked off a series of competing proposals and social media posts from the presumptive Democratic and Republican nominees, culminating in the two debates being scheduled for June and September within a matter of hours.\n\nMr. Biden then took to social media to announce that he had accepted an invitation to participate in a debate hosted by CNN on June 27, and urged Trump to join him.\n\n\"I've received and accepted an invitation from CNN for a debate on June 27th. Over to you, Donald. As you said: anywhere, any time, any place,\" Mr. Biden said in his post.\n\nCNN then announced it will host the debate between Mr. Biden and Trump at its Atlanta studios on June 27 at 9 p.m. ET. There will not be an audience \"to ensure candidates may maximize the time allotted in the debate,\" CNN said. Anchors Jake Tapper and Dana Bash will moderate, according to the network.\n\nCNN and ABC News laid out five criteria for qualifying for their debates. The candidates must:\n\nBe constitutionally eligible to serve as president\n\nFile a statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission\n\nHave their name appear on enough state ballots to reach the threshold of 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency\n\nAgree to the debate's rules and format\n\nReceive at least 15% in four separate national polls of registered or likely voters that meet CNN or ABC News standards.\n\nMr. Biden and Trump are the only two candidates seeking the presidency who qualify under those terms so far. It's unlikely that Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who is running as an independent, will be on the stage because of the polling requirement and number of states where he has secured access to the ballot.\n\nThe CNN debate is set to take place before the Republican and Democratic nominating conventions, when party delegates choose their respective presidential nominees.\n\nMr. Biden then announced that he had received and accepted an invitation to a second debate hosted by ABC News on Tuesday, Sept. 10. Trump quickly said he will also attend. His campaign is also pushing for two more debates in July and August.\n\nKennedy reacted to the debates by accusing the two candidates of \"colluding to lock America\" into a rematch of the 2020 election and criticized them as being unpopular.\n\n\"They are trying to exclude me from their debate because they are afraid I would win. Keeping viable candidates off the debate stage undermines democracy,\" he said in a social media post.\n\nHow the debates came together\n\nIn the letter from the Biden campaign sent earlier Wednesday, Jen O'Malley Dillon, chair of the president's reelection campaign, proposed one debate in late June, after the likely conclusion of Trump's ongoing criminal trial in New York and Mr. Biden's travel to the G7 Summit in Italy. Trump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records to allegedly cover up payments to an adult film star and has pleaded not guilty. The Biden campaign proposed a second debate in early September.\n\nTrump seemed to swiftly accept the Biden campaign's suggested debate schedule for June and September, writing on social media that he is \"ready and willing\" to debate his Democratic opponent at the two proposed times. But the presumptive GOP presidential nominee said he would \"strongly recommend\" more than two debates at a \"very large venue.\"\n\n\"Just tell me when, I'll be there,\" Trump wrote.\n\nIn his own video shared to social media, the president urged his Republican opponent to take him on.\n\n\"Donald Trump lost two debates to me in 2020, and since then, he hasn't shown up for a debate. Now he's acting like he wants to debate me again. Well, make my day, pal. I'll even do it twice. So let's pick the dates, Donald. I hear you're free on Wednesdays,\" Mr. Biden said. Trump's criminal trial does not convene on Wednesdays.\n\nDonald Trump lost two debates to me in 2020. Since then, he hasn\u2019t shown up for a debate.\n\n\n\nNow he\u2019s acting like he wants to debate me again.\n\n\n\nWell, make my day, pal. pic.twitter.com/AkPmvs2q4u \u2014 Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) May 15, 2024\n\nIn addition to specifying Mr. Biden's plans for facing off against Trump, O'Malley Dillon said the president will not participate in debates sponsored by the nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates, which has overseen presidential debates since 1988.\n\nInstead, Mr. Biden would take part in debates hosted by news organizations, O'Malley Dillon said. She cited what she said was the commission's unwillingness to enforce rules for candidates during the 2020 debates and the large audiences in attendance that disrupted the events. During the 2020 presidential campaign, the first debate between Trump and Mr. Biden descended into chaos as Trump repeatedly interrupted and spoke over Mr. Biden and moderators struggled to regain control of the event.\n\nMr. Biden clinched the Democratic presidential nomination and Trump secured the Republican nomination in mid-March, setting up a rematch of the 2020 contest for the White House.\n\nThe Commission on Presidential Debates said the sites it announced in November to host three presidential debates this year are prepared for the events. The commission said it is also ready to execute its plan for the debates.\n\n\"The American public deserves substantive debates from the leading candidates for president and vice president,\" it said in a statement. \"The nonpartisan [CPD] was established in 1987 specifically to ensure that such debates reliably take place and reach the widest television, radio and streaming audience.\"\n\nThe commission's three presidential debates were scheduled to take place in September and October at universities in Texas, Virginia and Utah.\n\nBiden's debate terms\n\nUnder the parameters laid out by the Biden campaign, the debates should be hosted by any broadcast organization that oversaw a Republican primary debate in 2016 that Trump participated in and a Democratic primary debate in 2020 that Mr. Biden took part in. The outlets that fit those terms are CBS News, ABC News, CNN and Telemundo. Telemundo and CNN hosted a Republican primary debate that Trump attended in 2016.\n\nTrump shunned the Republican primary debates for the 2024 election, but said he would take on Mr. Biden \"anytime, anywhere, any place.\"\n\nThe debates, the Biden campaign continued, should be one-on-one, a condition that would keep Kennedy off the stage.\n\nKeeping the debates to Mr. Biden and Trump allows \"voters to compare the only two candidates with any statistical chance of prevailing in the Electoral College \u2014 and not squandering debate time on candidates with no prospect of becoming President,\" O'Malley Dillon wrote.\n\nThe campaign said the broadcast hosts should select the moderators from their \"regular personnel, so as to avoid a 'ringer' or partisan,\" and time limits should be set for answers and responses to ensure time is evenly split between the two and avoid a \"spectacle of mutual interruption.\" O'Malley Dillon said microphones for the candidates should be active only when it is his turn to speak.\n\nFor the vice presidential debate, the Biden campaign suggested the first event be held in late July after the Republican National Convention and follow the same parameters for the presidential debates.\n\n\"As Donald Trump has said he will debate 'anytime, anywhere,' we hope both campaigns can quickly accept broadcast media debate invitations on the parameters above,\" she said. \"Americans need a debate on the issues \u2014 not a tedious debate about debates.\"\n\nRon Klain, the former White House chief of staff who has served Mr. Biden in various roles for nearly 40 years, said he will once again help his old boss prepare for televised debates with Trump.\n\nKlain stepped down as White House chief of staff last year and serves as chief legal officer for Airbnb. He confirmed in a text message to CBS News that he will use vacation time to help Mr. Biden prepare.\n\n\"Everyone has different ways of spending vacation \u2013 this will be mine,\" Klain said.\n\nHe previously helped Al Gore, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton prepare for their respective primary or general election debates with opponents.\n\nNews of Klain's vacation plans were first reported by The New York Times.\n\nTrump's debate terms\n\nIn their own proposal, Trump campaign senior advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles said the former president also accepted the Biden campaign's suggestion for a debate in September, but pushed for more than two events.\n\nThey suggested one debate per month in June, July, August and September, in addition to the vice presidential debate. Trump has not said who his running mate will be, though he is expected to announce his vice presidential pick closer to the Republican National Convention, which begins July 15 in Milwaukee.\n\n\"Additional dates will allow voters to have maximum exposure to the records and future visions of each candidate,\" LaCivita and Wiles wrote in a memo to O'Malley Dillon and the Biden campaign. \"We believe the American people deserve more than what the Biden administration has to offer.\"\n\nAaron Navarro and Jake Rosen contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Explainer: The Dominican Republic's 2024 Presidential and Congressional Elections\nMajor issues: Inflation, security, and Haitian relations\n\nTwo issues dominate the concerns of Dominicans going into the elections: inflation and crime.\n\nInflation hit 4.8 percent in 2023, above the government\u2019s 4.0 percent goal. Still, that\u2019s an improvement from 2021 and 2022 when the inflation rate soared over 8.0 percent. In an effort to combat high inflation generated by pandemic spending and impacts of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Central Bank has implemented monetary policies to stimulate the economy by providing credit to small- and medium-sized businesses. While the situation has improved over the past few years, inflation and the high cost of living still spell trouble for the 40 percent of Dominicans living in vulnerable economic conditions, per the World Bank. Despite the country having one of the highest GDP growth levels in Latin America and the Caribbean, 56 percent of Dominicans rated the economy as bad or very bad in a March Gallup poll.\n\nThen there\u2019s crime. The most recent survey of Enhogar, a study by the Dominican Republic\u2019s national statistics agency published in December 2023, showed that 29 percent of the population lives in fear of crime in their neighborhood. Perception of insecurity was especially acute among women. In response, the government has implemented a security strategy known as \u201cMy Safe Country,\u201d which includes measures to train police; to increase financing for education, food, and transportation; and to boost citizen participation in neighborhood activities.\n\nAnother issue in the election? Haiti. The neighboring country, which is also the Dominican Republic\u2019s second-biggest trading partner, continues to endure a period of deep instability after the collapse of its government. That crisis has pushed thousands of Haitians to flee to the Dominican Republic, where they join a preexisting large population of migrants, many of whom work as low-skilled, undocumented labor. Abinader has maintained a policy whereby his administration provides humanitarian aid to its neighbor, but will not offer security or military aid. His government is also constructing a wall between the countries. All three major candidates for president propose to continue a hardline approach to Haitian migration.",

        "text": "Movimiento Ciudadano: The Underdog of Mexico\u2019s 2024 Presidential Election?\nPolling data for Mexico\u2019s upcoming June 2nd presidential election consistently show the Morena candidate, Claudia Sheinbaum in the lead, the opposition candidate, X\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez, in second place, and trailing behind, usually with less than 10% of vote, the Movimiento Ciudadano candidate, Jorge \u00c1lvarez M\u00e1ynez. However, upon closer examination of two specific demographics, the \u201cyouth vote\u201d (18-34 years old) and voters in states where Movimiento Ciudadano has a stronghold, a different picture emerges.\n\nMovimiento Ciudadano hasn\u2019t yet gained a significant stronghold in central Mexico, but it has in the states of Nuevo Le\u00f3n and Jalisco, where the party holds two governorships. National surveys reveal M\u00e1ynez\u2019s popularity substantially below that of his competitors, but a survey conducted in Guadalajara (the capital of Jalisco) of 50 respondents (almost 70% of whom were between the ages of 18 and 34) showed otherwise. [1] The survey found that 34% of respondents plan to vote for M\u00e1ynez, 32% for Sheinbaum, and only 14% for G\u00e1lvez. 68% plan to vote for the Movimiento Ciudadano candidate for governor, Pablo Lemus. 84% of survey respondents said they utilize social media as their primary source for information about the elections and candidates, with 36% preferring Facebook and another 20% preferring TikTok. While this survey is a sampling of a small percentage of Jalisco\u2019s voting population, it paints a different picture than what the national surveys show.\n\nAlong these lines, but specifically focusing on the younger demographic of voters is the Simulacro Nacional, or the national election simulation. Last week, over a quarter of a million university students from more than 400 different universities and campuses across Mexico participated in these mock elections and Claudia Sheinbaum won with 63.5% of the vote, followed by Jorge \u00c1lvarez M\u00e1ynez with 23.1% of the vote, and X\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez with 8.5%. Among this population of young voters, Sheinbaum\u2019s lead is undeniably strong, and at the same time, M\u00e1ynez\u2019s performance should be recognized and his party\u2019s efforts to capture this vote applauded. Yes, Maynez\u2019s popularity in national surveys pales in comparison to that of his competitors', but these exercises reveal that Movimiento Ciudadano is a force to be reckoned with \u2013 and one that might impact the trajectory of Mexican politics, particularly for the next presidential cycle.\n\nM\u00e1ynez\u2019s performance should be studied, rather than criticized at this juncture. Though he has polled substantially below his competitors in national polls, he only just arrived on the national political scene in January of this year when he was named the Movimiento Ciudadano presidential candidate, just weeks after the original candidate, current Movimiento Ciudadano governor of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, Samuel Garc\u00eda, abruptly dropped out of the race. Of note, the party has faced significant internal conflict regarding the decision not to ally with the opposition for the 2024 elections. [2]\n\nMovimiento Ciudadano has taken a page of Morena\u2019s playbook \u2013 courting a specific sector of the voting population that has historically been overlooked \u2013 millennials \u2013 and made it the party\u2019s primary audience. Unlike his baby boomer competitors, M\u00e1ynez is a millennial and his campaign reflects as such, both in terms of the platform and PR strategy. In conjunction with traditional campaign promises of improving the security situation in Mexico, bolstering the economy, and addressing corruption, M\u00e1ynez\u2019s platform also includes mention of ensuring affordable housing (with a specific focus on younger generations), reforms to Mexico\u2019s pension plans, and even the legalization of certain drugs. Unlike his competitors who host traditional \u201cm\u00edtines\u201d to stump and meet potential voters, M\u00e1ynez has taken a different approach, hosting campaign events at universities around the country.\n\nThe party also knows the power of social media (largely in part thanks to the Monterrey Movimiento Ciudadano mayoral candidate and First Lady of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, Mariana Rodr\u00edguez) and has wielded it wisely to connect with voters. M\u00e1ynez lags behind in the polls, but the numbers on social media tell a different story. Following the April debate, the number of followers M\u00e1ynez has on Facebook and TikTok surpassed those of G\u00e1lvez. While social media following doesn\u2019t translate to voter turnout at the polls, in an increasingly ever-connected world, it does indicate popular support \u2013 and a captive audience, ready for the next electoral cycle.\n\nIt seems that Movimiento Ciudadano is in its \u201cbuilding season,\u201d not necessarily expecting full-blown success in this election, but rather, strategically plotting and planning for the chapter ahead \u2013 the 2030 presidential election. However, the significance and impact of Movimiento Ciudadano\u2019s participation in this presidential election cannot be overlooked.\n\nOne, in the short term, Movimiento Ciudadano\u2019s participation splits the vote, taking away votes from the other two candidates, predominantly impacting the opposition. In fact, just this week (less than three weeks away from Election Day), Luis Donaldo Colosio[3] suggested that M\u00e1ynez withdraw from the race, so that would-be M\u00e1ynez voters instead vote for the opposition candidate, thus increasing the odds of Morena\u2019s loss come election day. Alejandro Moreno, the PRI party president, encouraged this proposal, promising that if M\u00e1ynez withdraws from the race, Moreno, in exchange, will relinquish his title as party president to M\u00e1ynez. This must occur ahead of the third and final presidential debate on May 19th. M\u00e1ynez, for his part, has reaffirmed his commitment to participating in the race and has called Moreno\u2019s proposal a desperate act. Will Movimiento Ciudadano eventually cede and collaborate with the opposition to defeat the current ruling party? Or, does this set up an eventual alliance or commitment to collaborate between Movimiento Ciudadano and Morena, should Morena win the election? Or, the third, and most likely option, will Movimiento Ciudadano continue operating alone?\n\nSecond, Movimiento Ciudadano\u2019s public relations, voter courting strategy is a long-term game and the party is both building up and out its rolodex. How likely are these young voters, fueled by the momentum that Movimiento Ciudadano has garnered over the past year, likely to ride the wave into the next presidential election? Those between the ages of 18 to 34 years old constitute 37% of Mexico\u2019s eligible voting population, according to the INE. For comparison, voters who are 65 and older only represent 13%.\n\nOnly time will tell what becomes of Movimiento Ciudadano. Perhaps we\u2019re seeing the emergence of a new type of politics in Mexico, or at least a party that skews more toward courting younger voters as compared to the party politics of the past that focused on promoting and upholding the status quo. Or, maybe we\u2019re witnessing the emergence of a new political class in Mexico, the politician pseudo influencer, who in the case of Movimiento Ciudadano, is identified by their neon orange attire, use of the term fosfo fosfo, and above all, strategic use of social media. M\u00e1ynez may not outright win the election, but the popular support he\u2019s drummed up, particularly among millennial voters, and the controversy he\u2019s stirred up within Mexico\u2019s political circles are significant accomplishments in and of themselves.\n\n\n\n[1] Special thanks to Lic. Jes\u00fas Alejandro G\u00f3mez Ledezma for conducting the surveys and sharing the data.\n\n[2] As a result, key figures within the party ranks, such as Jalisco\u2019s Movimiento Ciudadano governor, Enrique Alfaro, have decided to step away from the party.\n\n[3] The current mayor of Monterrey, MC candidate for the Senate, and son of the late Luis Donaldo Colosio, the PRI presidential candidate who was murdered at a campaign rally in Tijuana in 1994.",

        "text": "Pete Buttigieg talks with WHYY News about 2024 election\nRussell-Sluchansky: Inflation has come down since the pandemic when it saw historic numbers, but the Bureau of Labor Statistics still puts it higher than pre-pandemic times, which really cuts into the increased wages that the campaign has talked about. So what is the message for voters like Laurie?\n\nButtigieg: I think the message for voters like Lori, again, is to look at the difference between what we are proposing to do about it and what Donald Trump wants to do about it, right? Joe Biden has been laser-focused on cutting costs. Yes, we faced price increases, by the way, the entire world has, as a result of COVID inflation is coming down, but it\u2019s still something that so many Americans are feeling.\n\nIt\u2019s why Joe Biden was so focused on things like cutting the cost of insulin, getting rid of junk fees on credit cards and other expenses that Americans face. It\u2019s why he\u2019s confronting corporations that have been taking advantage of people, and it just couldn\u2019t be more different than the anti-union, pro-corporation approach that Donald Trump took cutting taxes for the wealthy, opposing unions, opposing increases to the minimum wage that would actually make a difference when it comes to the everyday cost of living for Americans.\n\nRussell-Sluchansky: Despite all this, the most recent poll looking at Pennsylvania, this one from the New York Times, puts President [Biden] well underwater in terms of favorability, with 50% not happy with the president. Another poll showed that only 17% of voters were happy with the choices they were given between the two. My conversations here with Democrats really support those numbers. For example, I talked with Diane from Allentown, who said she plans to vote for the president but is really voting against the former president, as you were saying. Here\u2019s what she said about Joe Biden.\n\nDiane: \u201cI think he means well, I think he\u2019s trying his best. I think he\u2019s up against a lot. Age is a factor as far as the next election is concerned, but again, compared to the alternative, he\u2019s our best choice, in my opinion.\u201d\n\nRussell-Sluchansky: Now, this really kind of jives with what you\u2019re saying when a lot of Democrats I talk to talk about this election, they\u2019re talking about voting against Donald Trump. What are your internal polls saying about the success of really pumping up that as a campaign strategy?\n\nButtigieg: This is not just about what we\u2019re up against, but what we\u2019re for, and we talk a lot about both.\n\nWhen you have two people who have both been president, running for president against each other, you don\u2019t have the kind of things that go on when there\u2019s a brand-new face on the ballot. But you do have something that I actually think is an advantage for voters, which is exactly what you are comparing. You are comparing Joe Biden who, as Diane mentioned, is a good person who is doing everything that he can to make everyday life easier in America. Then you have someone like President Trump who is more focused on his own past and on revenge and retribution, whose presidency was marked by chaos, by inferior economic results compared to the current presidency, not to mention a violent attack on the United States Capitol.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to wonder what you\u2019re going to get. Again, I would focus not just on the promises that President Trump broke versus the promises that President Biden kept, like infrastructure, climate action, job creation and more, but the promises that Donald Trump kept taking away, [like] the right to choose. And if he kept that promise to take away rights in America, I think he would take away more rights in America given the chance.\n\nRussell-Sluchansky: All right. So much to talk about, but we have to leave it there. Thank you so much for your time, Mr. Buttigieg.\n\nButtigieg: Thank you again for having me.",

        "text": "Why Biden might be happy to debate Trump in June\nWhy Biden might be happy to debate Trump in June\n\nGetty Images The pair last debated four years ago, and there had been speculation over whether they would debate at all this time around\n\nIn the span of four hours on Wednesday, a plan to hold two presidential debates between Joe Biden and Donald Trump went from rumour to reality.\n\nWhile some details still need to be hammered out, it appears the Democratic and Republican candidates will face off twice, on 27 June and 10 September. Usually the debates are in September and October.\n\nMr Trump, who has for months been calling for a debate \"anytime, anywhere\", got what he wanted. Mr Biden, meanwhile, got to set the terms of their meetings.\n\nNow we have an idea of the agreed terms, here's a closer look at how the debates could benefit, or damage, the two campaigns.\n\nBiden takes the plunge\n\nThe president had been coy about whether he was ever going to debate his Republican opponent. But if he had taken a pass, he would have been the first president since Richard Nixon in 1972 to skip the debate process entirely.\n\nGiven that there have been repeated questions about his age and competency to serve another four years in office, a move to sidestep the presidential face-offs would have risked convincing the public that he was not up to the task.\n\nAs it was, he was able to set the terms of the debate in a way that could be to his advantage. The two events will be hosted by CNN and ABC News, and not Fox News, avoiding a debate moderator with a clear right-wing tilt.\n\nThe June debate will be held in CNN's Atlanta studios with no live audience, which also may play better for the president, whose crowds have been less enthusiastic than the former president's. It also guarantees Mr Biden will not be interrupted by pro-Palestinian protesters, which has been a campaign concern during recent public appearances.\n\nThere are several ways the early timing of the first debate - held, in a break with tradition, before the summer party nominating conventions - may also help Mr Biden.\n\nFirst, it will allow his team an earlier opportunity to frame the election as a binary choice between Mr Trump and Mr Biden. Mr Biden's advisers have long contended that as the public becomes more aware of the possibility of another Trump presidency, the Democrat's support will solidify.\n\nSecond, a June debate gives Mr Biden more time to recover if he has a weak performance. Incumbent presidents - from Ronald Reagan to Barack Obama - have a history of uneven first-debates. If Biden follows this trend, he has months, including what is sure to be a carefully scripted Democratic convention speech, to rebound.\n\nOf course, the plan also has risks. If he is still trailing in October, there won't be any high-profile debates, with their audiences in the tens of millions, to shake things up. There's also the chance he does struggle, which could lead to second-guessing about his decision to participate at all. And if he seriously falters in June, it may cement the public's view that he's not up to the task to the point where no convention speeches or multimillion-dollar advertising campaigns could change it.\n\nTrump's big debate gamble\n\nMr Trump gave up a lot of control to secure the president's debate commitment. If he soundly defeats Mr Biden in November, as he promises he will do, it will prove to have been worth it.\n\nThe upside of the debate plan for the former president is clear. He will have the opportunity to draw a sharp public contrast between himself and his opponent and, potentially, advance the notion that Mr Biden is feeble and that he would be a stronger, more capable leader.\n\nAs with Mr Biden, the early debate timing would give Mr Trump opportunity to recover if he doesn't fare well.\n\nWhile the Biden team has said the two currently scheduled presidential debates will be the only ones this season, Mr Trump can - and already has - called for more face-offs and can try to paint Mr Biden's refusal as a sign of weakness.\n\nMore on the US election\n\nThe agreement between the two campaigns, and their decision to circumvent the debate commission, will also make it more difficult for Mr Kennedy to appear on the stage. While it's unclear which candidate his presence would help or hurt most - both campaigns may have reason to want him excluded - the independent's campaign is a wildcard element that, as the candidate currently ahead in the polls, Mr Trump may be most keen to avoid.\n\nThe downsides for Mr Trump are also fairly clear. It's been nearly four years since the former president participated in a debate, so he may face the same risk of being caught flat-footed and rusty that Mr Biden faces.\n\nWhile he's a few years younger than Mr Biden, he still would be the oldest person elected US president if he were to win - and an uneven performance could raise concern about his own fitness for office. And thanks to all the disparaging remarks Mr Trump has made about his opponent, the bar for debate performance will probably be higher for him.\n\nBy agreeing to debates hosted by mainstream media outlets, Mr Trump will almost certainly face pointed questions about his refusal to accept the results of the 2020 election and his responsibility for the 6 January 2021 attack on the US Capitol - potentially reminding voters of the chaotic way his first term in office ended.\n\nBy allowing the Biden team to set the debates so early, the final month of the presidential campaign will be focused on organisation, advertising and voter turnout. That's where financial resources can make a big difference - and it's an area where Republicans have been trailing Democrats of late.\n\nFront-runners, in a position of strength, are typically the candidates who set the debate terms and, if desired, refuse to participate entirely. The trailing candidates, looking to catch a break, want debates early and often.\n\nIn this sense Mr Trump is again flipping conventional wisdom on its head. We'll see which candidate can best land on his feet.",

        "text": "Migrant crossings plunge at US-Mexico border - why it may not last\nMigrant crossings plunge at US-Mexico border - why it may not last\n\nGetty Images Increasing number of migrants have been stopped by Mexican authorities on their way north to the US border.\n\nMigrant detentions at the US-Mexico border have fallen dramatically in recent months, as a Mexican crackdown stops tens of thousands getting anywhere near a crossing point.\n\nExperts however believe that the reduction is only temporary and ultimately unsustainable.\n\nMore than 6.4 million migrants have been stopped crossing into the US illegally during Joe Biden's administration - a record high that has left him politically vulnerable with just six months to go until the US presidential election.\n\nAt a news conference earlier this week, Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador said that the number of migrants at the border had fallen by 50%, from a high of 12,000 a day to 6,000 a day four months later.\n\nSeparate statistics kept by US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) show that about 177,000 migrants \"encounters\" were recorded in January, followed by about 189,000 in both February and March.\n\nThat is a significant fall from December's 302,000.\n\nCBP figures published on 15 May show that migrant encounters fell even further to 179,000 in April. Of these, 128,000 tried to cross between points of entry unlawfully - a 30% reduction from the same time period in 2023.\n\nEven at this level, however, those figures are still significantly higher than was the case in previous years.\n\nMr L\u00f3pez Obrador credited cooperation between the US and Mexico for the recent decline, along with the increased availability of \"legal channels\".\n\nBut the primary reason, according to experts, is a Mexican crackdown on migrants transiting the country on their way north to the US.\n\n\"The only policy change has been Mexico cracking down harder,\" said Adam Isacson, a migration and border expert from the Washington Office on Latin America.\n\n\"Everything else is the same as it was [in December]. There's been no new real announcements, and no changes in deportations.... but it's become harder for them to get to the northern border.\"\n\nIn practice, the crackdown - which followed a December meeting between US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Mexican officials including Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador - has seen Mexican security forces set up new checkpoints on roads, increase patrols, and, in some cases, remove migrants from freight trains headed towards the US border.\n\nMexican government statistics also show that officials have smashed their own records, with about 120,000 detentions in January and February alone, the last months for which statistics are publicly available.\n\nThe vast majority of these migrants have remained inside Mexico, with only limited deportations of about 8,000 people mostly taking place to Guatemala and Honduras.\n\nInstead, large numbers of migrants are moved to Mexico's interior or southern regions.\n\nLila Abed, the acting director of the Mexico Institute at the Washington DC-based Wilson Center, told the BBC that the status quo was unsustainable and that the reductions are \"temporary, rather than permanent.\"\n\n\"The real issue for Mexico is how it's going to be able to attend to this increasing number of migrants and their communities,\" Ms Abed said, adding that Mexican authorities were \"completely overwhelmed\".\n\n\"Bussing migrants to southern Mexico is not solving the problem, it's just sort of putting a cap on it.\"\n\nAdditionally, Ms Abed said that the root causes of migration to the US - such as insecurity, government instability and economic hardships - have for the most part not changed.\n\n\"The root causes that are pushing migrants out of their countries of origin are being aggravated,\" she said. \"That's obviously going to cause a larger flow of migrants towards the United States.\"\n\nThe decline in migrant crossings at the US border comes at a politically fraught time for President Biden. Polls show that immigration is a primary electoral concern for many voters in the run-up to the presidential election in November.\n\nGetty Images Immigration and border security have emerged as primary electoral issues ahead of the November US election.\n\nA Gallup poll at the end of April found that 27% of Americans view immigration as the most important issue facing the country, topping the economy and inflation.\n\nA separate poll conducted in March by the Associated Press and NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that two-thirds of Americans now disapprove of Mr Biden's handling of the border, including about 40% of Democrat voters.\n\nThe White House, however, has been largely quiet on the recent drop in migrant arrivals and detentions.\n\nA White House statement in late April said only that Mr Biden and Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador had discussed \"how to effectively manage\" hemispheric migration, adding that both leaders had directed their national security teams to \"immediately implement concrete measures to significantly rescue irregular border crossings.\"\n\nThe BBC has reached out to the White House for comment.\n\nSome experts have suggested that the silence is reflective of a White House that is well aware that numbers could begin to climb again - potentially soon.\n\n\"I strongly suspect that the administration has finally learned its lesson about declaring victory early. We've seen that in the past, multiple times,\" said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, policy director at the American Immigration Council.\n\n\"But then after two or three months of lower numbers, they start to creep back up and the administration has to eat crow.\"\n\n\"I also suspect that they are aware that whether or not this is viable remains to be seen, and do not want to draw too much attention to it,\" he added.\n\nFaced with the possibility of another influx - and the lack of progress passing immigration reforms in Congress - the Biden administration is reportedly mulling a broad executive order that would dramatically limit the number of asylum seekers at the border and essentially shut it down if migrant figures rise above a certain point.\n\n\"The question is whether the numbers hold until after the November elections, but if the bubble bursts before November,\" Mr Isacson said.",

        "text": "News\nThe North American Studies Program welcomes Professor Bryan Wagner\n\nThe North American Studies Department is pleased to welcome Professor Bryan Wagner as a visiting scholar funded by a Lessenich fellowship. Professor Wagner will be researching and teaching in Bonn in collaboration with Prof. Dr. Sabine N. Meyer in June and July.\n\nBryan Wagner is Professor in the English Department and affiliated faculty in the American Studies Program, Folklore Program, and Center for the Study of Law and Society at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nHis research focuses on African American expression in the context of slavery and its aftermath, and he has particular interests in legal history, vernacular culture, urban studies, and digital humanities.\n\nHis first book, Disturbing the Peace: Black Culture and the Police Power after Slavery (Harvard University Press, 2009), offers a new theory of black vernacular tradition based on the tradition\u2019s historical engagement with criminal law. By interpreting outlaw legends and blues lyrics via the cues they take from the modern law of slavery and police, we discover a historical consciousness derived from the experience of legal dispossession that does not reduce to cultural inheritance.\n\nHis second book, The Tar Baby: A Global History (Princeton University Press, 2017), interprets the global tradition of the tar baby, a folktale that exists in hundreds of versions derived over centuries on at least five continents. We know the tar baby was circulating at the same time and in many of the same places as the philosophy of property and politics developed in colonial law and political economy, and it can also be shown that the story is addressed to many of the same problems\u2014labor and value, enclosure and settlement, crime and captivity\u2014presented in tracts and charters associated with the so-called great transformation in world history. When the tar baby is read alongside these philosophical cognates, it begins to look less like a hidden transcript coding context-bound and interest-based resistance, and instead more like a universal history that seeks to grasp all at once the interlocking processes by which custom was criminalized, lands were colonized, slaves were captured, and labor was bought and sold, even as it also reflects on the experience of disenchantment and the impact of science on the conflict over resources.\n\nOther books include Looking for Law in All the Wrong Places (Fordham University Press, 2019), an essay collection, edited with Marianne Constable and Leti Volpp; The Wild Tchoupitoulas (Bloomsbury, 33 \u2153 Series, 2019), a study of a classic funk album that helped to set the template for the commercialization of processional second-line music; and The Life and Legend of Bras-Coup\u00e9: The Fugitive Slave Who Fought the Law, Ruled the Swamp, Danced at Congo Square, Invented Jazz, and Died for Love (Louisiana State University Press, 2019), a documentary history of an eminent maroon.\n\nHe directs two multidisciplinary projects in the digital humanities: Louisiana Slave Conspiracies, an interactive archive of trial manuscripts related to slave conspiracies organized at the Pointe Coup\u00e9e Post in the Spanish territory of Louisiana in 1791 and 1795, and Trem\u00e9 1908, which tells the story of one year in the everyday life of an extraordinary neighborhood that was a crucible for civil rights activism, cultural fusion, and musical innovation. He is currently working on a public humanities project, An Open Classroom on New Orleans Culture, which is producing and sharing open educational resources with educators in collaboration with partnering organizations including Neighborhood Story Project and New Orleans Center for the Creative Arts.",

The provisional results are to be announced Wednesday 24 April 2024 and new directors notified. CorpVote conducted the voting for the election of the Board positions for the College.

If the person holds both offices, the person is counted only once to establish a quorum and may have only one vote, as per clauses 9.3.1 and 9.5.1 of the RACP Constitution. The candidate may choose to be appointed to their preferred position. The candidate can advise this after the AGM has closed on 17 May 2024. In this instance the candidate will need to submit a resignation in writing for the other position. Where the candidate resigns from one of the positions, this creates a casual vacancy. The Board is then required to fill the position as a casual vacancy as per clause 8.10 of the RACP Constitution. The Board resolved to fill the casual vacancy by appointing the Member that received the next highest number of votes in the relevant category of the 2024 election. A person appointed to a Board casual vacancy will hold that office until the next AGM and is eligible for re-election in accordance with the Constitution. A notification will be provided to each of the candidates advising them of the provisional results and that the successful candidate terms will commence at the end of the Annual General Meeting on Friday, 17 May 2024.\n\nElected College Body positions Elected College Body positions Division, Faculty, Chapter, Region Position Nominee Australasian Chapter of Palliative Medicine Aotearoa New Zealand Representative Dr Astrid Adams\n\nAll remaining vacancies not filled via the election process will be advertised as casual vacancies as set out in the Governance of College Bodies By-law (PDF).

Here are the people with the greatest potential to disrupt the race.\n\nJill Stein\n\nGetty Images Some Democrats believe Jill Stein's 2016 bid helped propel Donald Trump to victory\n\nThe activist and doctor ran as the Green Party's candidate in 2012 and 2016. Now back at 74 years old, she recently told BBC Americast that \"Americans are not voting for a candidate they like... They're generally voting against the candidate they hate the most. \"And that's no way for a democracy to function.\" Ms Stein calls for an \"economic bill of rights\" that would include universal access to healthcare and a right to employment. She also vows to fight climate change, defend abortion access and transgender rights, and was recently arrested at a student protest on behalf of Gaza. She is unlikely to get more than 2% of the vote - but that could still play spoiler to Ms Harris. Hillary Clinton supporters partly blame her for the Democrat's narrow defeat in 2016. In three critical states, Mrs Clinton lost to Mr Trump by fewer votes than Ms Stein received. During this election cycle, Ms Stein has accused Democrats of trying \"to sue us off multiple state ballots\" to cheat and \"change the rules to maintain their grip on power\". According to the party's website, Ms Stein will be on the ballot in at least four states, though her campaign is working to be added to more states. Butch Ware, a professor at the University of California Santa Barbara, is her running-mate.\n\nCornel West\n\nGetty Images Cornel West's campaign has focused on a socialist platform\n\nThe 70-year-old activist and well-known academic has a complicated presidential bid. He launched it in June with the People's Party. After falling out with the group, Mr West said he would seek the Green Party's nomination, but then changed course to run as an independent. His socialist platform includes funding public healthcare and slashing the US defence budget. Melina Abdullah, a member of the board of directors of the Black Lives Matter Grassroots organisation, is his running mate. He has attacked Mr Biden as a \"war criminal\" and Mr Trump as a \"fascist pied piper\".\n\nHis candidacy could have been a threat to Ms Harris in crucial swing states like Michigan, though his request to appear on the ballot there was recently denied. He is currently on the ballot in nine states and has struggled to raise money.\n\nChase Oliver\n\nGetty Images The Libertarian Party nominated Chase Oliver over Mr Trump and Mr Kennedy\n\nThe Libertarian Party - the third biggest political party in the country - has nominated Chase Oliver as their presidential candidate, with Mike ter Maat as his running mate. In doing so, they spurned Mr Trump and Mr Kennedy, both of whom spoke at the party's convention this month in a bid for its support. Mr Trump received a notably unfriendly reception and lashed out at the audience during his speech. Mr Oliver, an openly gay sales executive who previously ran on the Libertarian ticket for US congressional races in Georgia, says voters are done with picking from \"the lesser of two evils\". \"I'm just about to be the age of 40. I'm living the life of a normal American,\" he recently told BBC Americast. \"I understand what it's like to go to the grocery store with the same amount of money but seeing less and less filling up the cart. Those are things that Donald Trump and Joe Biden are so far-removed from that they just can't communicate those values anymore.\"\n\nHis campaign advocates for balancing the budget, ending military support to Israel and Ukraine, closing all overseas US military bases and abolishing the death penalty. Libertarians support small government and individual freedoms, typically pulling 1-3% of the vote from Republicans. The party's nominee in 2020 received more votes than Mr Trump's margin of defeat in three battleground states.\n\nRobert F Kennedy Jr\n\nGetty Images RFK Jr said he ran against the \"two-headed monster\" of American politics",

        "text": "Morehouse: College divided over Biden's upcoming graduation speech\nMorehouse: College divided over Biden's upcoming graduation speech\n\nAnadolu President Joe Biden delivers remarks about constitutional voting rights in Atlanta, GA, in 2022\n\nAs one of the nation's most preeminent historically black colleges prepares to host President Joe Biden, students say controversy surrounding his visit has overshadowed their graduation.\n\nMr Biden will travel to Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia, on Sunday to deliver the school's commencement address, a tradition complicated by criticism over his handling of the Israel-Gaza war, which has sparked nationwide college protests.\n\nThe speech's audience and setting - a battleground state critical to Mr Biden's re-election - also bring into focus the looming November presidential election. Morehouse, one of 107 historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) in the US, and the only all-male HBCU, offers Mr Biden a chance to address young black men - a crucial group of voters whose support for the Democratic president has eroded.\n\nWhile the college has seen a handful of demonstrations against the war in Gaza, they have not reached the size and scope of others. But frustration grew in April after students' concerns at protests went unanswered and Mr Biden was announced as their graduation speaker.\n\nSome students and faculty called for the president's invitation to be rescinded.\n\nThe college responded by giving students and faculty an opportunity to voice concerns at forums on campus. But Morehouse President David Thomas made clear that Mr Biden would be the speaker.\n\n\"It makes me feel like it's no longer about me,\" said Marq Riggins, a Morehouse 2024 graduate who said he's not enthusiastic about the remarks. \"He's coming here to take pictures with us.''\n\nIn a procedural step on Thursday, faculty at Morehouse voted on giving Mr Biden an honorary degree during Sunday's graduation. Some media reports indicated opposition among faculty, but ultimately they voted in favour of the honorary degree, 50-38.\n\nMr Riggins is not alone in his frustration and distrust of the president.\n\nA 13 May poll from the New York Times, the Philadelphia Inquirer and Siena College that examined swing states found the president behind with multiple constituencies he is courting, including younger voters, voters in Georgia and young black voters.\n\nBlack voters are a critical voting bloc for Democrats, especially in Georgia, where about a third of the population is black. Mr Biden won Georgia in 2020 by a mere 12,000 votes - one of the slimmest state margins in his victory over former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe White House has dismissed recent polls, pointing instead to low black unemployment. Ahead of his November rematch with Mr Trump, Mr Biden also is touting student debt cancellation, infrastructure investments, and more than $16bn in federal funding and investments in HBCUs to black voters.\n\nSteve Benjamin, who leads the White House Office of Public Engagement, told reporters on Thursday he travelled to Morehouse last week to learn from students and faculty \"what they wanted to hear on their very special commencement day\".\n\nMr Benjamin said many students wanted to talk about the Middle East, reconnecting communities and wealth creation. He added that the president believes in free speech and that extends to those who wish to protest at the event.\n\n\"I wouldn't be opposed to being disruptive,\" said Mr Riggins, the student. \"It's a sloppy mess of political agendas.\"\n\nBrycen Barnes, a Morehouse graduating senior, said he is supportive of Mr Biden's visit, but doesn't necessarily want it to be a campaign stop.\n\n\"I don't view it as a necessarily bad thing,\" he said. \"I'm glad we're having a president [speak to us]. I want it to be genuine that he's coming here, I don't want it to be political.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Biden sat for two interviews on black radio stations, including one in Atlanta where he told listeners that Mr Trump hurt black people during his time in office.\n\n\"Black unemployment, uninsurance rates went up under Trump,\" Mr Biden said. \"Trump's tax plan reinforced discrimination. Typical white households got double the cut of the typical black household. They botched Covid-19 response, leaving black people dead and black-owned businesses shuttered.\"\n\nKaroline Leavitt, a campaign spokesperson for Mr Trump, countered that Mr Biden is being forced to buy multimillion-dollar ads to get support from \"what he thought was his vote base\".\n\n\"Black and Hispanic voters, like all Americans, are worse-off now than they were under President Trump - by a lot - and every poll reflects that reality,\" Ms Leavitt told the BBC. \"They have less money and higher prices for everything while being forced to live under a weak President who puts illegal immigrants' interests ahead of theirs.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Mr Biden marked the 70th anniversary of Brown v Board of Education, the historic ruling that found school segregation to be unconstitutional. Derrick Johnson, president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), dismissed questions about Mr Biden and black voters, saying that opinion polls have been wrong in the past.\n\nAfter the commencement, the president will travel to Detroit to address a NAACP chapter dinner.\n\nFormer US congressman Cedric Richmond, a senior adviser to the Democratic National Committee who organised Mr Biden's visit to Morehouse, said it will give the president a chance to directly address young black people.\n\n\"Students understand how worthy it is or what a big moment it is for a president to be addressing their institution,\" Mr Richmond told the BBC.",

Legal experts explain why he can remain in power.\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy's five-year term as Ukraine's president formally ends on May 20. An election would normally have been held in late March, but the parliament postponed the vote as the country is still at war and under martial law. But a major question remains for Ukrainians: who might succeed Zelenskyy once he leaves office?\n\nIn early 2024, few politicians and commentators openly pondered who could, or should, follow Zelenskyy. At the end of February, when Zelenskyy looked back on the past two years of fighting with Russia, the president dismissed any talk questioning his legitimacy as a \"hostile narrative.\"\n\nSpeaking with journalists, Zelenskyy said neither the country's allies nor anyone in Ukraine were asking such questions. He said any such speculation was \"part of the Russian Federation's program.\"\n\nUkrainian legal experts consulted by DW said they expected Zelenskyy would remain in power until a new president is elected. \"The Ukrainian constitution states this clearly,\" said Andriy Mahera, of the Center of Policy and Legal Reform in Kyiv. \"The president does not automatically lose his powers five years after inauguration. These powers are only removed when the newly elected president takes office, i.e., after elections.\"\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy marks 5 years as Ukraine's president To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nPresidential and parliamentary elections are currently out of the question. Ukraine's constitution places a temporary restriction on the former, whereas martial law bans both \u2014 in part , officials have said, to protect voters from harm.\n\nShould Zelenskyy resign?\n\nMartial law also curtails certain civil liberties. \"Some constitutional rights and freedoms are restricted, for example, the right to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and freedom of movement,\" said Mahera. The Central Election Commission and the Institute of Lawmaking and Scientific-Legal Expertises of National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine issued similar assessments earlier this year.\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy has often been seen visiting soldiers near the front line Image: Ukrainian Presidential Press Service/REUTERS\n\nVeteran Ukrainian politicians have also waded into the debate. Hryhoriy Omelchenko, a former parliamentarian and member of the constitutional drafting commission of the mid-1990s, said it was no coincidence that the extension of presidential terms remains unregulated, adding that this serves as safeguard.\n\nEven so, Omelchenko penned a letter to Zelenskyy \u2014 published in Ukrajina Moloda newspaper in March \u2014 urging the president \"not to usurp state power\" and to voluntarily resign in May.\n\nZelenskyy's legitimacy derives not just from the law, but also from broad popular support. A survey conducted by Ukraine's Razumkov Center in January found that 69% of respondents trust Zelenskyy. Less than a quarter said they do not trust the president.\n\nA survey by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) in early February found that 69% of respondents thought Zelenskyy should remain in power until martial law ends. Only 15% of those surveyed supported holding elections in the current circumstances, and 10% wanted Zelenskyy to hand over power to parliamentary Speaker Ruslan Stefanchuk.\n\nParliamentary Speaker Ruslan Stefanchuk is seen as one possible replacement for Zelenskyy Image: Ukrainian Presidential Press Off/Zumapress/picture alliance\n\nKIIS executive director Anton Hrushetskyi told DW that either scenario risked undermining the government's legitimacy and destabilizing Ukraine.\n\n\"Millions of people are abroad, millions live under occupation, hundreds of thousands are serving in the army \u2014 if citizens cannot take part in elections, as either voters or candidates, this will undermine the legitimacy of the election results,\" he said.\n\nConstitutional Court could rule on president's powers\n\nLegal experts told DW that the Constitutional Court should settle the debate over the president's powers and the timing of an election. \"Only the Constitutional Court can interpret the constitution to ascertain whether other laws are in line with it,\" said Mahera.\n\nThe president, government, Supreme Court, a group of 45 parliamentarians or parliament's human rights commissioner would need to call on the Constitutional Court to review the matter.\n\nDzerkalo Tyzhnia reported in late February that Zelenskyy's office was working on a petition to the Constitutional Court. According to the news site , the plan was for 45 members of Zelenskyy's Servant of the People party to file the petition.\n\nAccording to the parliamentary group, Zelenskyy has full legitimacy. The opposition is largely in agreement.\n\nVarious parties in Ukraine have said they have no intention of appealing to the Constitutional Court, highlighting an inter-party agreement not to hold elections until martial law ends.\n\nThis article was originally written in German.",

Here's a look at what they stand for and how their policy proposals compare on 10 key issues.\n\nEconomy\n\nThe economic policy of President Biden has its own name - Bidenomics - and involves building the economy, in his words, \"from the bottom up\". That means investing in infrastructure and manufacturing, clean energy and expanding job opportunities. The economic data shows strong growth and jobs creation under his leadership. But voters feel the pain of high inflation, especially food and petrol. Mr Trump has blamed his successor's big spending for inflation and vowed a return to an agenda of lower taxes and less regulations. He also says he will look to replace Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell, a man he appointed but now accuses of being too \"political\".\n\nImmigration\n\nPresident Biden's promise of a more humane approach on immigration saw him suspend or revoke several Trump-era border policies, lift the refugee admissions cap and expand humanitarian parole. But a massive surge in illegal immigration and ensuing public backlash has prompted the Democrat to shift in favour of more restrictive measures. He is expected to issue an executive order that would allow border officials to limit migrant arrivals and swiftly deport those who enter the US illegally. Mr Trump rallied his congressional allies to kill that bill, claiming it did not go far enough. He is promising, if re-elected, to revive first-term policies that will \"seal the border\" and to carry out \"the largest deportation operation\" in US history. The Republican has also pledged to end birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented migrants and to wage war on Mexican drug cartels.\n\nAbortion\n\nPresident Biden has painted his opponent as the \"architect\" of an assault on reproductive freedom, after a Supreme Court with three Trump-appointed justices overturned Roe v Wade, the landmark 1973 ruling that granted US women the constitutional right to an abortion. With several states moving to restrict abortion access, he is promising to restore the rights afforded by Roe as the law of the land if Democrats win back Congress. Mr Trump calls himself \"proudly the person responsible\" for ending Roe but at the same time has criticised extreme measures in states like Arizona and Alabama. After a muddled few months, he finally set out his position as supporting states' rights to determine their own laws. But he declined to show support for a national law or how many weeks in his view should be the limit.\n\nUkraine aid\n\nPresident Biden has repeatedly urged Congress to continue funding Ukraine, warning that a win for Russia's Vladimir Putin will endanger Europe and embolden another major US adversary - China. Mr Trump warned in February he would \"encourage\" Russia to \"do whatever the hell they want\" to Nato countries if those allies did not meet their financial obligations to the bloc - though he has since softened his rhetoric.\n\nIsrael/Gaza War\n\nPresident Biden remains \"rock solid\" in his support for Israel, providing billions of dollars worth in weapons and urging more aid to the US ally, but has ramped up public criticisms of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about his handling of the war in Gaza. Often boastful of his support for Israel, Mr Trump now says the country must \"finish what they started\" against Hamas militants in Gaza but \"get it over with fast\" because it is \"losing the PR war\".\n\nTaxes\n\nPresident Biden supports raising the corporate income tax rate to 28%, bringing it closer to the 35% rate that prevailed prior to Mr Trump's term. He has also proposed imposing higher tax rates on the wealthiest Americans, cracking down on tax avoidance, and expanding tax credits for low earners and families. He recently escalated Trump-imposed tariffs on China, including a 100 percent tax on its electric vehicles. Mr Trump is pledging across-the-board tax cuts if he returns to office, in part by prolonging soon-to-expire income tax cuts, along with estate and wealth tax breaks, from legislation he signed in 2017. He will maintain the corporate income tax rate at 21% and proposes a universal 10% tariff on all US imports, and a 60% tariff on imports from China.\n\nHealthcare\n\nPresident Biden and Democrats have taken action to lower prescription drugs costs for older people. As the \"Obamacare\" health insurance programme continues to grow in popularity, he has fought to protect and expand coverage, and lower costs, moves that have pushed enrolment to an all-time high. Mr Trump has often vowed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act with \"something better\", but failed to detail an alternative. He and his Republican Party are routinely fending off Democratic claims that he will chip away at the Social Security and Medicare safety nets for American seniors.\n\nCrime\n\nPresident Biden credits investment in public safety for the significant decline in violent crime after major spikes during the first two years of the pandemic. Recent FBI data shows there is a downward trend but many Americans, like those surveyed by Gallup a few months ago, feel that crime is rising. New York recently deployed its National Guard to patrol the city subway in response to a spike in transit crime. Mr Trump has often highlighted violent incidents involving migrants or singled out public safety concerns in Democratic-led cities to paint a picture of surging, out-of-control crime levels under his rival. He has called for the death penalty to be used on drug dealers.\n\nClimate\n\nPresident Biden invested a historic $300bn (\u00a3239bn) into clean energy and climate initiatives through his Inflation Reduction Act. He has also set ambitious new goals for cutting greenhouse gas and vehicle emissions, and spurred a boon in the green energy economy. But some climate activists oppose actions he has taken to boost oil and gas production, including the Willow oil project in Alaska. Mr Trump, by contrast, has again taken up the vow to \"drill, baby, drill\" and unleash domestic energy production, in part to bring prices at the pump down. Domestic production is, however, higher under Mr Biden. At a recent dinner with oil executives and lobbyists, the Republican promised to eliminate Mr Biden's new climate rules and environmental regulations if they donated $1bn to his campaign.\n\nGun laws\n\nPresident Biden signed into law the most significant gun safety legislation in more than two decades, which includes enhanced background checks for gun buyers and other protections. His justice department has also banned the manufacture and sale of \"ghost guns\". He has repeatedly urged Congress to pass a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Mr Trump weakened US gun laws in office, but also took action to ban bump stocks, the accessories that allow semi-automatic weapons to fire more quickly. Accepting the National Rifle Association's endorsement this month, he said he would unravel all of Mr Biden's new gun rules and fire the head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.",

        "text": "Time to Reset the U.S. Trade Agenda\nOver the past three years, U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan have worked to articulate a \u201cworker-centered\u201d trade policy while arguing for a \u201cnew Washington consensus\u201d in U.S. international economic policy that will foster global investment and cooperation on issues like climate and development.1 Tai, Sullivan, and other U.S. officials have succeeded in laying out a vision for American industrial policy, one that has attracted hundreds of billions of dollars of announced investment in U.S. computer chip manufacturing and clean energy technology. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also has popularized the concept of \u201cfriendshoring\u201d\u2014the idea that U.S. allies and partners can benefit as multinational corporations diversify away from China.2 This term first appeared in a 2021 White House report on supply chains.\n\nBut when it comes to the brass tacks of trade\u2014trade deals, tariff lines, the paperwork that companies have to file at the border, and other mechanics\u2014U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s administration has not articulated a coherent agenda. At times, the administration has tried to use the specter of China\u2019s economic threat to generate support for trade deals. One notable example is its signature Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), which is intended to strengthen economic relations between the United States and countries across the Pacific. But geopolitical arguments for deals are failing to carry the day. Last November, deep congressional skepticism and electoral concerns spurred the administration to indefinitely postpone the IPEF trade pillar, and it is unclear whether it will complete the work even after the 2024 election.\n\nWhen it comes to the brass tacks of trade\u2014trade deals, tariff lines, the paperwork that companies have to file at the border, and other mechanics\u2014U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s administration has not articulated a coherent agenda.\n\nFormer president Donald Trump, in his current campaign to return to the White House, does have a clear vision for trade: he has announced plans to deploy tariffs and other protectionist measures to support favored U.S. industries.3 The architect of Trump\u2019s trade policy between 2017 and early 2021, former U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer, has argued that the United States should vigorously deploy tariffs and other trade restrictions both to protect U.S. industry and to force not only China, but a variety of European and Asian countries, to cease unfair trade practices.4 However, a number of experts have raised concerns about the economic impacts of these policies as well as the risks they would pose to U.S. geopolitical relationships.5\n\nResetting America\u2019s trade agenda and developing a trade vision capable of drawing broad support across Washington is going to require the government to, as Steve Jobs would have said, \u201cthink different.\u201d Rather than treating trade deals as a geopolitical endeavor that the United States should suffer through to support America\u2019s allies and partners, or pursuing Trump\u2019s vision of simply reducing trade (the geopolitical argument), the United States should get back to a basic premise that has guided successful trade policy in the past\u2014that policymakers can develop and promote trade policies that advance American economic interests as well as American geopolitical interests.\n\nResetting America\u2019s trade agenda and developing a trade vision capable of drawing broad support across Washington is going to require the government to, as Steve Jobs would have said, \u201cthink different.\u201d\n\nGiven the nature of the economic challenges the United States currently faces, this approach will require policymakers to spend less time on the geopolitics and more time on the economics. That choice, in turn, will encourage a shift in the primary focus away from regional deals and toward narrower sectoral deals that address the problems of greatest concern to most Americans, such as climate, energy, and the looming artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. To actually solve those problems, the United States should be open to using a new set of tools in creating trade deals, including those related to financial instruments, development, and national security. Today\u2019s biggest challenges cannot be solved simply with market access and regulatory cooperation. The next chapter in American trade policy will need to entail new types of sectoral deals between the United States and key allies and partners on a set of issues that include climate and energy, supply chains, and AI and the digital economy.\n\nThe Rise of the Modern Trade Paradigm\n\nRebooting America\u2019s trade agenda first requires understanding why the protrade consensus that prevailed from the 1990s to the mid-2010s\u2014the most recent era of significant U.S. trade dealmaking\u2014broke down.\n\nSince the end of World War II, the United States has undertaken successful rounds of trade dealmaking during periods when trade deals had both a clear geopolitical and a clear economic logic. In the late 1940s, in the aftermath of the war, the deal that fit both U.S. geopolitical and economic interests was the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Geopolitically, American policymakers saw the GATT as a tool to shore up Western alliances in the nascent days of the Cold War.6 From an economic perspective, trade negotiators designed the GATT to be an antidote to prevent a return to the \u201cbeggar thy neighbor\u201d tariff policies of the 1930s, which postwar economists and policymakers saw as having exacerbated the Great Depression. The agreement required reductions in tariff rates and ensured that members accorded each other \u201cmost favored nation\u201d trading status to put further downward pressure on tariffs over time. From a U.S. perspective, American officials also understood the GATT as a tool to help open markets to U.S. goods at a time when the United States was the world\u2019s largest net exporter and needed foreign markets to replace war-driven demand for U.S. industry. Reductions in foreign tariffs on U.S. goods provided a major direct benefit for American industry.7\n\nSince the end of World War II, the United States has undertaken successful rounds of trade dealmaking during periods when trade deals had both a clear geopolitical and a clear economic logic.\n\nThe United States pushed to expand the GATT several times during the Cold War. The so-called Kennedy Round of 1964\u20131967 resulted in additional tariff reductions and began to establish disciplines around dumping, the practice where a country sells a product internationally at a lower price than the product sells for in its home market. The Tokyo Round of the 1970s expanded participation in the GATT to more than one hundred countries, seeking to include much of the nonaligned developing world. It began to try to tackle nontariff barriers and \u201cvoluntary export restraints,\u201d a type of measure where countries would agree to limit export quantities in exchange for avoiding tariffs. With the introduction of a Subsidies Code, the Tokyo Round also began to introduce the concept of rules around subsidies.\n\nHowever, the modern trade orthodoxy that guided U.S. trade policy from the end of the Cold War through the mid-2010s crystallized in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The fall of the Berlin Wall ushered in America\u2019s unipolar moment, when America\u2019s geopolitical policymakers saw an opportunity to use trade and economic relations to anchor its former Soviet adversaries and emerging geopolitical competitors, notably China, in a U.S.-led international order. Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and Bill Clinton, meanwhile, presided over a period of neoliberal economic consensus in Washington that Washington thought was an economic model appropriate for the world as well. Trade policy and trade deals (as well as other policy levers such as the International Monetary Fund) offered a tool to promote that U.S. economic model abroad. This intersection of geopolitics and economics ushered in a remarkably productive period of trade policymaking, with initiatives such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the World Trade Organization (WTO), and free trade agreements (FTAs) with more than a dozen nations. Other related policies included the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), which cut tariffs on imports from democratic countries in Africa in a bid to foster development and democratic progress on the continent.\n\nThe deals of this era had a clear geopolitical logic. NAFTA was designed to strengthen the North American political union and, in the eyes of both presidents Bush and Clinton, to provide an eventual pathway toward a more democratic and economically unified Western Hemisphere\u2014a vision that George H. W. Bush\u2019s son and later president George W. Bush, took further with the Central America\u2013Dominican Republic FTA (CAFTA-DR) a decade after NAFTA entered into force. The WTO, and China\u2019s ultimate accession to it at the end of the decade, reflected the prevailing 1990s geopolitical view that a global trading arrangement would help draw countries like China toward the West. As Clinton said of China\u2019s accession in 1999, \u201cit represents the most significant opportunity that we have had to create positive change in China since the 1970s,\u201d noting that China was \u201cagreeing to import one of democracy\u2019s most cherished values: economic freedom. The more China liberalizes its economy, the more fully it will liberate the potential of its people.\u201d8 Or, as George W. Bush said about U.S. legislation to enact the CAFTA-DR agreement, \u201cthis bill is more than a trade bill. This bill is a commitment of freedom-loving nations to advance peace and prosperity throughout the Western hemisphere.\u201d9\n\nFTAs with Morocco (2004), Bahrain (2005), and Oman (2006), enacted in the years following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, were intended to bolster American allies in the war against Islamic terrorism and with the aspiration that economic progress could reduce the terrorist threat. In a 2003 presidential speech, George W. Bush laid out his economic vision for the region, which proposed bilateral FTAs as stepping stones toward a Middle East Free Trade Area. As he remarked, \u201cacross the globe, free markets and trade have helped defeat poverty, and taught men and women the habits of liberty.\u201d10\n\nThe economic logic behind these deals was as important as the geopolitics. From a macroeconomic perspective, the trade deals of this era reflected a view that the U.S. economy could benefit from offshoring lower-value U.S. manufacturing in order to lower consumer costs, while encouraging the domestic growth of higher-value industries like software, healthcare, and value-added manufacturing. As Clinton put it in 1993, \u201cthis debate about NAFTA is a debate about whether we will embrace [economic] changes and create the jobs of tomorrow, or try to resist these changes, hoping we can preserve the economic structures of yesterday.\u201d11 Trade globalization was thought to create opportunities for new U.S. exports, encourage innovation by forcing companies to compete globally, and lower consumer costs. Furthering Clinton\u2019s argument in support of NAFTA and an aspirational Latin America free trade deal, policymakers also thought that an expanded U.S. trade block could deliver the economies of scale needed to compete with the emerging European Union trade block and growing intra-Asian regional trade.12\n\nWith the texts of the deals themselves, trade policymakers sought to promote the then-prevailing economic consensus in Washington, which championed reduced government subsidies; nondiscrimination for goods produced by other countries; lower regulatory burdens for business, including the then-nascent digital economy; and strong intellectual property (IP) protections. Policymakers also sought to promote higher labor and environmental standards and to tackle challenges like corruption. Senior figures in Washington often spoke of these goals as raising standards internationally and writing global rules based on U.S. rules.\n\nThe WTO\u2019s Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM Agreement), which went into effect in 1995, for example, drastically expanded the pre-WTO GATT\u2019s disciplines regarding industrial subsidies.13 Throughout the text of the WTO agreements and U.S. FTAs, countries agreed to accord \u201cnational treatment\u201d to each other\u2019s goods, committing not to give preference to domestically produced goods. In most U.S. FTAs, and with respect to the countries that have signed up to the WTO\u2019s Government Procurement Agreement, this nondiscrimination commitment even extended to government procurement of goods\u2014meaning that the U.S. government, for example, should not show a preference for U.S.-made cars over foreign cars when buying for the federal fleet.14 Of course, these agreements also required governments to allow U.S. companies to bid on their procurement contracts.15\n\nU.S. FTAs typically included chapters ensuring that FTA partners offered IP protections comparable to U.S. IP protections. Several also sought to codify legal immunity for digital platforms regarding content posted by their users, just as platforms have immunity in the United States from lawsuits over user-posted content. Free data flows generally were protected, and governments made other commitments to not limit the operations of digital platforms operating in their countries. Trade policymakers also regularly touted deal language that promoted workers\u2019 rights and environmental standards.16\n\nThe final chapter of this era of trade policymaking was President Barack Obama\u2019s support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a trade deal between a dozen economies in the Americas and Asia negotiated by the Obama administration in 2016. The TPP expanded on earlier FTAs from the 2000s and early 2010s, including by developing new disciplines on state-owned enterprises and currency manipulation.17 But the Obama administration made its case for the TPP largely on geopolitical grounds, arguing that it would be an important economic counterweight to China\u2019s influence in the Pacific and an economic pillar of the administration\u2019s \u201cpivot to China.\u201d18\n\nThe Modern Paradigm\u2019s Fall From Grace\n\nObama signed the TPP in January 2016. But even as he pushed for congressional ratification of the deal, it was becoming clear that the trade paradigm that had dominated Washington policy discussions since the early 1990s was falling out of favor. By late 2015, key congressional leaders had begun to express skepticism of the emerging TPP provisions, and ultimately they never scheduled a vote on the deal.19 Both of the major presidential candidates in 2016, Democrat Hillary Clinton (who had supported the early development of the TPP while serving as Obama\u2019s secretary of state) and Republican Donald Trump, opposed the deal on the campaign trail, and Trump withdrew the United States from the deal shortly after his inauguration in 2017. (The other members of the deal, led by Japan, moved forward and completed the deal, rebranded as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, in 2018.)\n\nObama signed the TPP in January 2016. But even as he pushed for congressional ratification of the deal, it was becoming clear that the trade paradigm that had dominated Washington policy discussions since the early 1990s was falling out of favor.\n\nAs president, Trump generally eschewed traditional trade deals in favor of a tariff-heavy approach to trade, intended to put pressure on China while protecting U.S. industries, like steel, that he deemed important. Nevertheless, he did successfully enact the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), an overhaul of the NAFTA agreement from twenty-five years earlier. And while some in the trade policy and national security communities hoped that Biden would launch negotiations to reenter the TPP, Biden has instead launched trade initiatives like the IPEF that are intended promote cooperation on trade and standards but do not provide access to the U.S. market as traditional FTAs would. And even without U.S. market access, such initiatives have proved politically controversial. In November 2023, for instance, Biden indefinitely postponed finalization of the trade-related aspects of IPEF owing to concerns by Democrats in Congress that the deal would be politically harmful and due to opposition by American labor unions.20 Biden also quietly postponed nascent trade talks with the United Kingdom and Kenya that began in the last months of the Trump administration, and late last year his trade representative, Katherine Tai, withdrew long-standing U.S. support for proposed digital trade rules at the WTO. Trump, in his campaign to regain the presidency this year, has doubled down on his commitment to tariffs and other protectionist measures rather than deals, floating the idea of imposing a 60 percent tariff on goods imported from China and a 10 percent tariff on products imported from everywhere else.21\n\nOf course, trade has long been a hot-button political issue. Texas billionaire H. Ross Perot made his opposition to NAFTA a signature issue in his 1992 independent presidential campaign against Bill Clinton and incumbent George H. W. Bush, and trade deal approvals have always been hard fought in Congress. But for the twenty-five-year period between 1990 and the mid-2010s, geopolitical and economic logic were able to overcome that political opposition to see deals to fruition. Today, there is scant evidence that new trade deals could get through Congress, and a dwindling number of elected political leaders are willing to argue in favor of them. There are several reasons for this change in political support.\n\nTrade has long been a hot-button political issue. Texas billionaire H. Ross Perot made his opposition to NAFTA a signature issue in his 1992 independent presidential campaign against Bill Clinton and incumbent George H. W. Bush, and trade deal approvals have always been hard fought in Congress.\n\nThe first is the shifting U.S. relationship with China. Although economic research from the 1990s and early 2000s generally found that expanding U.S. trade flows had at most a limited impact on U.S. manufacturing employment, with other factors such as automation playing a larger role, research from the mid- and late 2010s found that the \u201cChina shock\u201d of growing U.S.-China trade in the 2000s had substantially more disruptive impacts on jobs.22 Moreover, communities adversely impacted by the China shock have seen little recovery over the past decade.23 Adverse employment impacts from trade with China, combined with China\u2019s rise as a geopolitical competitor, have led to bipartisan support for \u201cderisking\u201d U.S. supply chains from China, fueled the arguments of trade skeptics, and renewed a focus on U.S. domestic manufacturing.\n\nThe second reason is shifts in domestic political preferences. It is true that some polling shows that the majority of Americans are supportive of trade: a 2023 poll commissioned by the Chicago Council for Global Affairs, for example, found that 74 percent of Americans say \u201ctrade is good for the U.S. economy.\u201d24 But as prominent economist Alan Blinder pointed out several years ago in Foreign Affairs, \u201cmost Americans\u2019 belief in free trade is a mile wide but an inch deep,\u201d with polling responses varying widely depending on which questions are being asked and whether Americans are asked only about trade in the abstract or also about American manufacturing and jobs.25\n\nTrade policy is a classic example of an issue where a constituency that is invested deeply in and affected by an issue, such as specific U.S. industries and workers who face the risk of losses from trade, exert more influence than a majority of voters who may benefit from lower prices but who do not see their well-being as being deeply connected to trade issues. Recent polling by American Compass, a conservative organization that is skeptical of trade deals, has also shown that while a plurality of Americans thinks they personally benefit from globalization, a similar plurality thinks the United States as a whole has been harmed.26 Other recent polling suggests that on trade, more Americans trust Trump, with his zeal for tariffs, than trust Biden.27 Academic research, meanwhile, indicates that while Trump\u2019s tariffs were an economic mixed bag, they won Republicans votes at the ballot box.28\n\nA third reason is that the raw economic benefits of trade deals have become less compelling. Take the TPP as an example: even the Obama administration\u2019s own official estimate found that the TPP would add just 0.15 percent to U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) after a decade, hardly a compelling economic justification for the deal.29 And in the years since Trump abandoned the deal, actual U.S. trade flows have still moved in a beneficial direction: China\u2019s share of U.S. goods imports declined from a high of over 20 percent in the late 2010s to approximately 15 percent last year, while the absolute value of U.S. goods imports from China fell last year to the lowest level in a decade.30 Trade with allies and partners also has grown: since 2017, U.S imports of goods from India are up 37 percent, up 80 percent from Indonesia, up 61 percent from the Philippines, and up a whopping 200 percent from Vietnam\u2014the last of these now exports goods valued at a quarter of its entire GDP to the United States. The United States became India\u2019s largest trading partner in 2023, while U.S. exports to the European Union and European imports from the United States are both up more than 25 percent over the past few years.31 Overall U.S. exports today substantially exceed prepandemic levels, reflecting growing global demand for U.S. energy, agriculture, and manufactured goods, as well as U.S. services.\n\nMeanwhile, Americans traditionally thought to be adversely impacted by trade are doing well. Real wages for lower-income Americans grew strongly in 2023, and, in a reversal of the trend that has prevailed for most of the past two decades, the real wage growth for lower-income Americans over the past two years has been higher than the rate of wage growth for higher-income Americans.32 Women and Black Americans also saw historic gains in the labor market.33 A situation where both U.S. companies and U.S. workers are doing well creates little incentive to open U.S. markets to more competition. Numbers like these reinforce skepticism about the benefits of new FTAs.\n\nAmericans traditionally thought to be adversely impacted by trade are doing well. Real wages for lower-income Americans grew strongly in 2023.\n\nBut perhaps the most important reason for declining U.S. political support for new trade deals is that the economic theory of the case that underpinned the deals of the 1990s to the mid-2010s has fallen out of favor in Washington. At a fundamental level, a bipartisan consensus has emerged in Washington that the United States should rebuild its manufacturing industrial base and focus more on the economic well-being of American workers. Irrespective of whether prioritizing manufacturing optimizes American economic growth, there is strong political support for doing so.\n\nIn some sectors, U.S. domestic support for reindustrialization is driven by geopolitics: Congress\u2019s bipartisan support for the CHIPS Act in 2022, which will provide more than $75 billion in incentives for manufacturing semiconductors in the United States, was driven in part by concern that a conflict between China and Taiwan could cut off America\u2019s access to the chips it needs for industrial, defense, and consumer applications. In other sectors, such as manufacturing clean energy technologies, the push for reindustrialization is driven by a combination of geopolitical desires\u2014ensuring that the United States is not dependent on China for green technologies\u2014as well as domestic economic interests in boosting manufacturing employment in emerging manufacturing sectors. Across the political aisle, Biden\u2019s trade representative Katherine Tai and Trump\u2019s former trade representative Robert Lighthizer are united in a view that a goal of trade policy should be to raise wages and well-being for workers and that, for too long, trade policy has focused on benefits to consumers.\n\nAt a macroeconomic level, this desire to reindustrialize in many respects runs counter to the economic theory that underpinned many of the major trade deals of the past, which posited that U.S. workers would move up into \u201chigher value\u201d sectors like information technology, healthcare, and advanced manufacturing as the United States offshored lower-value (and lower profit margin) types of manufacturing. Moreover, many of the tools that policymakers want to deploy to rebuild manufacturing may run up against the trade rules that the United States long supported. Many of the United States\u2019 European and Asian allies, for example, argue that the manufacturing subsidies the United States adopted in the CHIPS Act and particularly the green energy\u2013focused Inflation Reduction Act violate the spirit and likely the letter of provisions of the WTO and U.S. trade agreements that long sought to limit industrial subsidies or at least give countries the right to retaliate against them.34 Likewise, \u201cBuy America\u201d provisions that direct the U.S. government to purchase American-made products run counter to trade rules on government procurement long supported by the United States.\n\nThe United States confronts a similar dynamic with respect to policymakers\u2019 preferences on technology and the digital economy. Going back to the early days of the internet and continuing through the 2019 U.S.-Japan digital agreement, U.S. trade agreements have sought to promote light-touch regulation of the tech sector, guarantee the free flow of data across borders, and protect tech companies from lawsuits for content posted online. Today, Democrats and Republicans alike are pursuing a much more aggressive regulatory approach to technology companies, including competition policy crackdowns, efforts to repeal companies\u2019 immunity for content posted online, and increased restrictions on cross-border data flows, at least to China. Some members of Congress and policy experts in the United States even want to revisit long-standing patent and copyright protections\u2014such as the Biden administration\u2019s current consideration of exercising \u201cmarch in rights\u201d to override patents to reduce drug costs\u2014arguing that U.S. law has become too protective of intellectual property.35 The rise of generative AI is also likely to prompt a profound reassessment of intellectual property protections. These shifting domestic preferences, much like America\u2019s growing preference for industrial policy, in many ways run counter to provisions historically supported in U.S. trade deals and will require a reassessment and overhaul of the trade rules America pushes for.\n\nHow to Reset the Agenda\n\nFaced with fading support for FTAs, over the past two years trade-focused experts, industry lobbies, and protrade officials in Washington have floated a number of ways to reboot support for trade deals. The most popular approach has been to lean heavily on geopolitical arguments for trade. Commentators and political figures from across the political spectrum have argued that geopolitical competition with China makes trade deals with allies important: a late 2023 report by the bipartisan U.S. House of Representatives Select Committee on China, for example, argued that to compete with China the United States should \u201cpursue trade agreements with strong rules of origin and high standards,\u201d and it suggested Taiwan and possibly the United Kingdom and Japan as partners.36 As the Washington Post put it more succinctly in the title of a 2023 editorial, \u201cTo compete with China, the U.S. should put real trade deals on the table.\u201d37\n\nGeopolitics has been the driving argument for the Biden administration\u2019s IPEF. As Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said at a 2022 launch event, the IPEF \u201cmarks an important turning point in restoring U.S. economic leadership in the region and presenting Indo-Pacific countries an alternative to China\u2019s approach to these critical issues.\u201d38 Commentators such as Matthias Dopfner, meanwhile, have argued that Western democratic states should create a democratic trading block that increasingly would align trade policy with values while establishing the type of large economic scale that drives the efficiency gains that have been a long-standing economic argument for trade.39\n\nThe idea of a broad democratic trading bloc is appealing as a long-term vision. But there is little reason to expect that geopolitical arguments for trade will prevail in the debate\u2014particularly after they failed both to gain support for the TPP and to prevent Biden from postponing the IPEF trade pillar. The political and policy reality is that, aside from America\u2019s robust defense budget, Americans are wary of policies that they perceive as requiring the American taxpayer to pay for the benefit of even other democratic states, as evidenced by the comparatively low levels of U.S. foreign assistance, and, more recently, the sharp congressional debate over continuing U.S. military and economic support to Ukraine.40 Framing trade deals as a sort of tax the United States should pay to strengthen the democratic world against China and other autocracies is unlikely to be a winning argument in the American heartland without a healthy dose of economic self-interest thrown in as well. Moreover, a number of large emerging market democracies that would be an important part of a democratic trading block, such as India and Brazil, have traditionally pursued protectionists trade policies and seem unlikely to be interested in a broad market liberalization in the near or mid-term.\n\nThe idea of a broad democratic trading bloc is appealing as a long-term vision. But there is little reason to expect that geopolitical arguments for trade will prevail in the debate.\n\nA handful of former officials, seeing the political success of the USMCA\u2014Trump\u2019s updated NAFTA\u2014have argued that the new agreement could be expanded to add additional members, potentially ultimately countries on both sides of the Pacific.41 But here, too, both the politics and the policies likely would prove challenging. Although there was broad bipartisan support for USMCA, that support reflected the fact that the United States already had a trade deal with Mexico and Canada (NAFTA) and bipartisan recognition that after twenty-five years, elements of NAFTA were in need of an update. Adding more countries, which would de facto result in the United States entering into new agreements with countries that did not have preexisting FTAs, would carry a different and almost certainly more challenging set of political dynamics. Instead, the way to reset the trade agenda is to start by resetting the economic logic of deals. If successful periods of trade policymaking have occurred in the past when the United States saw deals as advancing both its economic and its geopolitical interests, policymakers need deals that work on the economics as well as the geopolitics.\n\nTo reset the economics, policymakers should start by thinking less about traditional goals of market liberalization and more about discrete global challenges that require international economic cooperation\u2014and possible ways of using trade deals to address those challenges. This would almost certainly mean pivoting from a bilateral or regional approach to trade to a sectoral approach to trade that brings together different sets of international partners to address discrete challenges.\n\nTo reset the economics, policymakers should start by thinking less about traditional goals of market liberalization and more about discrete global challenges that require international economic cooperation.\n\nStart with climate and energy. Global climate change poses an existential threat, as carbon dioxide emissions hit a new global high in 2023 despite years of international promises to address the problem.42 The United States accounts for only about 15 percent of total global emissions, whereas traded goods and services account for perhaps 25 percent of global emissions.43 Trade policy offers a powerful tool to tackle the 85 percent of emissions that originate outside the United States. Meanwhile, many U.S. allies and partners face a near-term challenge of securing their supplies of traditional fossil fuel energy, particularly following Russia\u2019s 2022 war on Ukraine. European allies, for example, have had to scramble to find substitutes for Russian oil and gas. Even the United States remains far too dependent on Russia for uranium for nuclear power.44\n\nA climate and energy agreement could bring together a group of countries with the technologies and critical materials needed to produce clean energy, such as South Korea on battery technology, Indonesia for critical minerals, and the European Union for its role in clean power. The countries could work together to coordinate clean energy supply chains and industrial policies to promote the adoption and manufacturing of clean energy technologies. They also could commit to technological cooperation on clean energy technologies, with members, for example, offering streamlined permitting for nuclear energy construction from other member states. As with any trade deal, there would be an economic give and take: the United States and Europe, for instance, could offer countries access to incentives for green energy manufacturing in exchange for reliable access to critical inputs produced with high environmental and labor standards.\n\nA climate and energy agreement could bring together a group of countries with the technologies and critical materials needed to produce clean energy.\n\nMeanwhile, the United States and Canada, major producers of traditional fossil fuels, could commit to providing access to fuels such as liquefied natural gas to address near-term energy security needs while the green transition is underway. The United States also could commit to maintaining high tariffs on Chinese clean energy technologies, including Chinese clean energy technologies produced in third countries, leveraging supply chain diversification away from China as an incentive for participation. It might also make efforts to lean heavily on the European Union and other allies to agree to impose similar tariffs on their imports of green energy products, such as electric vehicles (EVs), from China.\n\nConversely, countries could coordinate so-called carbon border adjustment mechanisms, which impose tariffs on products based on their carbon emissions, to put pressure on nonmember states like China and other highly polluting countries to reduce their emissions as well. Indeed, the United States and Europe are already discussing miniature versions of coordinated trade action for the clean economy. The proposed Global Arrangement for Sustainable Steel and Aluminum would promote trade in low-carbon steel and aluminum products, and proposed agreements on critical minerals would offer foreign battery materials makers some access to U.S. Inflation Reduction Act subsidies.45 These nascent steps could be bolstered and expanded into a compelling agenda.\n\nA second sectoral area for trade policy focus would be to develop an \u201ceconomic security\u201d arrangement that coordinated industrial policy measures while strengthening supply chains for critical products. Countries such as Germany and Japan have joined the United States in pursuing new industrial policy measures, as in the case of the European CHIPS Act, which provides incentives for semiconductor manufacturing in Europe to match the U.S. version.46 Although this approach is welcome, in that it will likely spur further global production of important products like green technologies and semiconductors, poorly coordinated industrial policy measures risk triggering global subsidy fights and creating incentives for companies to play governments off against one another in a bid to maximize subsidies beyond those strictly needed to spur a project.\n\nMeanwhile, the United States continues to face significant supply chain risks for other key products, such as medical devices and pharmaceutical ingredients. The production of many pharmaceuticals ingredients and some medical devices is concentrated on China and India. The United States, Europe, Israel, and a number of other countries, however, have a strong interest in resilience. An economic security arrangement could enable like-minded countries to coordinate industrial policy measures and promote supply chain resilience across critical products.\n\nAn economic security arrangement could enable like-minded countries to coordinate industrial policy measures and promote supply chain resilience across critical products.\n\nA final area for a sectoral agreement is AI and the digital economy. The United States has already begun to promote shared global standards for AI development through the G7\u2019s Hiroshima process.47 Over time, an AI and digital economy agreement could link G7 political agreements into binding commitments for a larger number of countries to adopt. With respect to the digital economy, such agreements could establish shared standards and rules of managing data flows to strategic competitors, notably China, to prohibitions on government review of source code for apps and software developed in participating countries and expanded access to the digital economy and trusted telecommunications network infrastructure.\n\nSectoral agreements also would let the United States reconceptualize the tools that are included in a trade agreement. Since the first modern FTA in the 1980s, American trade agreements have focused on reducing tariffs and aligning regulations, generally around American standards. But trade\u2014the actual exchange of goods and services and the associated economic activity\u2014depends at least as much on policies and tools outside the scope of these FTAs as it does on FTA provisions: effective infrastructure, streamlined permitting processes, access to capital, and a skilled workforce. It is time for the United States to open the aperture of what a trade agreement can include to bring in a larger set of tools and potential commitments. For example, an AI and digital economy agreement should not be limited to governance and regulatory standards\u2014it also should include meaningful financial commitments to help developing-world partner countries procure secure Western telecommunications equipment, rather than relying on Chinese suppliers. Similarly, a climate and energy agreement should include commitments to work together on streamlining the permitting process for high-priority projects that require a footprint across participating countries.\n\nNational security tools should also be on the table. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) and export controls have come to play a far more prominent role in the international economy in recent years. Here, the United States should use trade deals in an offensive rather than defensive manner, for example, using trade deals to lock in commitments by foreign governments to restrict Chinese acquisitions of strategic companies in their countries. But the United States should also use its own national security tools as an incentive. A climate and energy agreement, for example, should promise to whitelist reputable automotive companies from allied nations like Japan for streamlined CFIUS approval, ensuring that they can invest in promising EV and autonomous driving companies in the United States. A digital economy agreement could include commitments not to impose export controls on allies without advance notice and consultation.\n\nFinally, sectoral deals will let the United States focus trade provisions on specific facilities, rather than country of production. When the Trump administration negotiated the USMCA, for example, it included novel provisions that required workers to be paid at least $16 an hour for automotive parts to qualify for USMCA tariff treatment\u2014essentially meaning that only certain Mexican plants qualify. Sectoral trade agreements are well suited to take this type of approach: a climate and energy agreement, for example, could offer foreign-made electric parts access to some of the subsidies contained in the Inflation Reduction Act, but only for facilities that meet the highest labor and environmental standards.\n\nSectoral agreements also offer a new set of opportunities\u2014to reframe trade deals as solving tangible problems that matter to the American people and to the world at large, and to negotiate rules that would internationalize some domestic policy changes within the United States.\n\nNegotiating large sectoral agreements undoubtedly will be challenging, as countries argue over the scope of covered sectors, market access, and the commitments to put on the table. But sectoral agreements also offer a new set of opportunities\u2014to reframe trade deals as solving tangible problems that matter to the American people and to the world at large, and to negotiate rules that would internationalize some domestic policy changes within the United States.\n\nAddressing China\u2014and Whither the WTO?\n\nOf course, a rebooted U.S. trade agenda is not just about deals with allies\u2014it also requires addressing the U.S. trade relationship with China.\n\nFor many years, the strategic paradigm of U.S. trade policy toward China was defined by the hope that economic ties would persuade China to continue on a course of gradual economic and political liberalization. By the mid-2010s, it was clear that this paradigm had failed, prompting Trump to impose sweeping tariffs in a bid to generate negotiating leverage to compel China to change its economic model. China responded to the tariffs, initially with retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports like agricultural products, and ultimately Trump offered tens of billions of dollars in assistance to U.S. farmers to offset the impacts of Chinese tariffs.48 Later, China offered a handful of concessions as part of a \u201cPhase 1\u201d trade deal, largely to avoid a threatened future tariff escalation. However, China steadfastly refused to make more fundamental changes to its economy and market, and there is no evidence that China\u2019s willingness to reform has increased in the years since.\n\nMoreover, even in the unlikely event that China made additional trade concessions to the United States, it is far from clear that they should be accepted: the United States has a strategic interest in reducing its dependencies on China in critical goods irrespective of whether China offers better terms on trade. For example, even if China somehow offered to allow American firms to produce critical minerals or EV batteries in China on fair terms, the United States has a strategic interest in ensuring that its domestic markets are not reliant on those supplies. The United States of course should pursue appropriate, fair terms for trade in nonstrategic goods, but when it comes to critical products, the U.S. objective should be to derisk the relationship, not for American and Chinese firms to compete on a level playing field.\n\nEven in the unlikely event that China made additional trade concessions to the United States, it is far from clear that they should be accepted.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, the United States should rebalance its China tariffs to prioritize derisking rather than leverage for a deal. For example, it should raise tariffs on products where supply chain vulnerabilities remain acute, like EVs, batteries, medicines, and critical materials, while potentially offering some reductions in tariffs on nonstrategic consumer goods.\n\nEffective derisking will require more than simple tariffs on China, however: it also will require measures to reduce the Chinese content in imports from third countries. There is a growing body of evidence, for example, that some of America\u2019s growing imports from Vietnam are of products composed mostly of Chinese components, with low-value finishing work done in Vietnam. The United States needs to revisit the so-called rules of origin that determine what a product\u2019s country of origin is for tariff purposes to begin derisking the upstream elements of critical supply chains. It also needs to figure out how to tackle China\u2019s dominance in a handful of strategic construction industries, like shipbuilding and port infrastructure, where China\u2019s impacts are global.\n\nThough a U.S. pivot to sectoral agreements and more active management of the U.S.-China trade relationship could offer the potential to reboot the U.S. trade agenda, it will draw even more questions from U.S. allies about whether the United States has any residual support for the WTO. The WTO still serves as a basic framework for trade between nearly 200 countries, but the simple, often unspoken reality is that many American policymakers today regard the WTO as an outdated institution that reflects a different geopolitical moment. One of the WTO\u2019s core tenets is that countries would accord each other preferential \u201cmost favored nation\u201d trade status, in that the United States would set similar tariffs for both competitors like China and allies like Germany. With the resurrection of great power geopolitics as a defining feature of international relations, for most American policymakers it makes little sense for the United States to promote a global trading regime. Instead, most U.S. policymakers would prefer to see the development of a U.S.-centered trading bloc or blocs among allies and partners.\n\nThat said, most of America\u2019s allies remain committed to the WTO, for understandable reasons. As the world\u2019s largest economy, the United States is relatively well-positioned to negotiate bilateral or plurilateral agreements with major trading partners. Most small and midsize countries, however, strongly benefit from a stable global trading system rather than having to negotiate hundreds of bespoke agreements. The WTO also offers smaller countries a set of rules they see as being a valuable check on both the protectionist actions of large countries and for smaller countries to manage trade among themselves. The WTO itself, meanwhile, requires consensus for major changes, making reform unlikely. Moreover, a U.S. withdrawal from the WTO would be costly. It would result in more than one hundred countries around the world having the right to impose higher tariffs on the United States. To avoid that outcome, the United States would have to negotiate an unmanageable number of new deals in a short time frame.\n\nThe WTO also offers smaller countries a set of rules they see as being a valuable check on both the protectionist actions of large countries and for smaller countries to manage trade among themselves.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no clear path forward to resolve global differences on the WTO, given differences of both interest and opinion between the United States and its partners. The simplest path is likely for the United States and China, or perhaps the G7 on one side and China on the other, to reach a kind of mutual detente in which WTO rules would not actually govern trade between them. In many ways, this scenario would simply codify and expand the existing de facto reality between Washington and Beijing, where both Trump\u2019s 2018 tariffs on China and China\u2019s retaliation violate WTO rules, but the two governments effectively have reached a mutual understanding on tariff rates that simply exist outside the WTO system. Over the longer term, however, the world may see global trade continue to move toward discrete blocs\u2014and this trend is already well underway.49 But there is not yet any international consensus on what a vision for that future would look like.\n\nConclusion: Does Trade Policy Matter?\n\nOf course, for many Americans, and many policymakers, a rational lesson of the past few years could be that American trade policy does not need a reboot. Supply chains are diversifying away from China, U.S. exports are up, and real wages for workers are rising. Even if allies and partners complain about the lack of new American trade deals, rising actual trade volumes and closer defense relationships, like the AUKUS nuclear submarine deal with Australia and the UK and closer U.S. military cooperation with the Philippines, help to strengthen geopolitical ties. And even policymakers who want to use trade deals to strengthen geopolitical relations have to acknowledge that the correlation between economic and geopolitical relations is far from perfect. After all, Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 despite decades of European policy aimed at using trade to anchor Russia economically into the West. As Lighthizer told a House committee last year, the iconic rock band the Beatles taught him that \u201cmoney can\u2019t buy me love\u201d and that he doubted that \u201ctransferring our wealth to these people is going to make them like us more.\u201d50\n\nThe best argument is that trade is a key element of solving global challenges that affect us all, like the green energy transition and the risks of AI and the digital economy.\n\nThe strongest argument for rebooting U.S. trade policy ultimately may not be geopolitics, nor even the economic argument that trade deals will help an already-strong U.S economy. Instead, the best argument is that trade is a key element of solving global challenges that affect us all, like the green energy transition and the risks of AI and the digital economy. For trade policy to advance those goals, and win the domestic support that will be needed to make them happen, it is time to develop a trade policy designed around them.\n\nNotes\n\n1 Katherine Tai, \u201cRemarks of Ambassador Katherine Tai Outlining the Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s \u2018Worker-Centered Trade Policy,\u2019\u201d Office of the United States Trade Representative, June 2021, https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/speeches-and-remarks/2021/june/remarks-ambassador-katherine-tai-outlining-biden-harris-administrations-worker-centered-trade-policy; Jake Sullivan, \u201cRemarks by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on Renewing American Economic Leadership at the Brookings Institution,\u201d White House, April 27, 2023, https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/04/27/remarks-by-national-security-advisor-jake-sullivan-on-renewing-american-economic-leadership-at-the-brookings-institution/.\n\n2 See, for example, Janet Yellen, \u201cRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L.

But a massive surge in illegal immigration and ensuing public backlash has prompted the Democrat to shift in favour of more restrictive measures. He is expected to issue an executive order that would allow border officials to limit migrant arrivals and swiftly deport those who enter the US illegally.\n\nMr Trump rallied his congressional allies to kill that bill, claiming it did not go far enough. He is promising, if re-elected, to revive first-term policies that will \"seal the border\" and to carry out \"the largest deportation operation\" in US history. The Republican has also pledged to end birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented migrants and to wage war on Mexican drug cartels.",

        "text": "2024 Taiwanese presidential election\nPresidential elections were held in Taiwan on 13 January 2024 as part of the 2024 general elections.[1][2] Tsai Ing-wen of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), the incumbent president of the Republic of China, was ineligible for reelection due to term limits. As such, the DPP nominated Vice President Lai Ching-te, who had secured the party chairmanship by acclamation in March 2023. He selected Hsiao Bi-khim, a former US citizen and the then Representative to the United States, as his running mate. Lai was elected president with a plurality of 40.05% and was inaugurated on 20 May 2024.[3][4][5][6]\n\nThe opposition Kuomintang (KMT) nominated the incumbent New Taipei mayor Hou Yu-ih as their candidate for president in May 2023. In November, Hou chose the former Legislative Yuan member Jaw Shaw-kong to be his running mate. The Taiwan People's Party (TPP) nominated Ko Wen-je, its leader, the former Mayor of Taipei, who in turn chose Legislative Yuan member Cynthia Wu as his running mate. Despite previously saying he would support Hou's nomination, businessman Terry Gou declared his own independent bid in September 2023, before ultimately dropping out in November. Although the KMT and TPP had initially agreed to field a joint ticket in November 2023, the two sides were unable to reach a final agreement, and each announced their own vice presidential candidate on the last day of registration.\n\nThis presidential election had a turnout rate of 71.86%, which was a 3.04% reduction from the 2020 election. This marked the first time since the 2000 election that the winning candidate obtained less than 50% of the vote, and the first time that a party won more than two consecutive presidential elections since direct elections were introduced in 1996.\n\nBackground [ edit ]\n\nTsai Ing-wen, the incumbent President of the Republic of China (Taiwan), was ineligible to seek re-election after serving two terms.\n\nTsai Ing-wen of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) became the first female president after winning the 2016 presidential election, defeating KMT nominee Eric Chu. She won a second term in 2020 and continued to serve until 20 May 2024.[7] Tsai resigned as party chairperson after the DPP suffered losses in the 2022 Taiwanese local elections. She was replaced in an acting capacity by Chen Chi-mai.[8] Tsai's Vice President Lai Ching-te ultimately became the party chairperson by acclamation in late 2022.[9]\n\nQualifications and procedure [ edit ]\n\nPresidential and vice presidential candidates are elected on the same ticket using first-past-the-post voting. This will be the eighth direct election of the president and vice president, the posts having previously been indirectly elected by the National Assembly until 1996. According to the constitution, Tsai, having served two terms, is term-limited from office. Under Article 22 of the Presidential and Vice Presidential Election and Recall Act, only the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), Kuomintang (KMT), Taiwan People's Party (TPP), and New Power Party (NPP), having received more than five percent of the total vote in either the last presidential or legislative election, are eligible to contest the election.[citation needed]\n\nCandidates register with the Central Election Commission. Under Article 23, independent candidates and smaller parties are also eligible to contest, registering as the candidates for president and Vice President by the way of joint signature shall, within five days after the public notice for election is issued, apply to the Central Election Commission to be the presentees recommended by way of joint signature and to receive a list of joint signers, and pay a deposit of NT$1,000,000. If the number of joint signers reaches 1.5% of the total electors in the latest Presidential and Vice Presidential Election within the time limit, which is 45 days under normal circumstances or 25 days in case of a by-election or a reelection, the presentees will be allowed to proceed with contesting in the election after the joint signature documents are examined.[10] For the 2024 presidential election, the number of signatures required for independent candidates was approximately 290,000.[11] The complete petition was to be submitted between 13 and 17 September 2023, and the signature collection period followed from 17 September to 2 November 2023.[12] Presidential candidacies were formally registered between 20 and 24 November 2023.[13] Lots for ballot positioning were drawn on 11 December; the Taiwan People's Party ticket was to be listed first, followed by the Democratic Progressive Party, then the Kuomintang.[14]\n\nTimetable [ edit ]\n\nNominations [ edit ]\n\nDemocratic Progressive Party [ edit ]\n\nIncumbent president, two-time Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential nominee, and former Chair of the DPP Tsai Ing-wen is ineligible to run, having completed two consecutive terms. Tsai resigned as DPP Chair in 2022, following the party's poor performance in the local elections of that year.[21] After Tsai's resignation, Vice President Lai Ching-te (also known as William Lai[22]) was unanimously elected to succeed her as Chair of the DPP.[23] Lai was previously selected to be Tsai's running mate after she defeated him in the 2020 primary.[24] No primary was held, and Lai Ching-te, being the only individual to register in the party's presidential primary, is the nominee of the Democratic Progressive Party.[25][26][27]\n\nIn November 2023, it was reported that Lai was considering selecting Hsiao Bi-khim (also known as Louise Hsiao), Taiwan's representative to the United States, as his running mate.[28] Hsiao resigned from her position as US representative (de facto ambassador) and returned to Taiwan on 19 November.[29] Lai officially named Hsiao as the election running mate on the same day.[30] Upon selecting Hsiao, Lai called his new running mate \"a warrior for democracy\" with whom he shared a common vision for Taiwan. Lai's decision to have Hsiao as his running mate was seen as a nod to the importance between Taiwan's relationship with the US. The Lai-Hsiao ticket formally registered at the Central Election Commission on 20 November 2023.[31]\n\nNominees [ edit ]\n\nKuomintang [ edit ]\n\nHou Yu-ih, the Mayor of New Taipei since 2018, was drafted by the Kuomintang (KMT) on 17 May 2023 to be its nominee for the presidency.[32] Hou faced opposition from Foxconn founder Terry Gou, who had earlier stated that he would support Hou.[33] On 24 November 2023, the Kuomintang named former legislator Jaw Shaw-kong as its vice presidential candidate.[34]\n\nNominees [ edit ]\n\nTaiwan People's Party [ edit ]\n\nKo Wen-je, being the only individual to register in the party's presidential primary, is the nominee of the Taiwan People's Party (TPP).[35][36] On 24 November 2023, Ko selected Cynthia Wu, current legislator since November 2022, as his running mate.[37]\n\nNominees [ edit ]\n\nOther parties and independents [ edit ]\n\nAll independent and minor party candidates needed a minimum of 290,000 signatures to register with the Central Election Commission.[38]\n\nTerry Gou [ edit ]\n\nAdvertising for Terry Gou's presidential campaign remained on public transportation in the days after he suspended his campaign.\n\nBillionaire businessman Terry Gou, who founded the global technology manufacturing company Foxconn in 1974, declared his own presidential run as an independent candidate on 28 August 2023.[39] This was despite previously stating he would support Kuomintang nominee Hou Yu-ih. The KMT described Gou's announcement as 'deeply regrettable'.[40] Lai Ching-te welcomed Gou's entrance into the race, saying he would be happy to take on the challenge.[41] Gou was the first of the mainstream candidates to announce his running mate; he selected actress Lai Pei-hsia [zh] (otherwise known as Tammy Lai) as his running mate on 14 September.[42] Lai had previously played a fictional Taiwanese presidential candidate on a Chinese-language Netflix series, Wave Makers.[43] Gou's campaign was mired by allegations that it was buying signatures.[44] By November 2023, at least 20 separate investigations into fraudulent practices and signature forgeries were opened.[45] 7 people were arrested in what was described as a 'signature-buying scheme' a few weeks earlier.[38] Gou denied these allegations, and claimed that individuals who were buying signatures were acting on their own accord and were not part of his official campaign. Gou submitted his signatures on 1 November 2023.[46] On 13 November, over 900,000 of Gou's submitted signatures were validated by the election commission, qualifying him to run the presidential election.[47] Amidst the deadline to register with the Central Election Commission, Gou released a statement on 24 November dropping out of the race.[48] In a statement, Gou said \"I'm dropping out, but my aspirations live on.\"[49] He did not endorse a candidate.[50]\n\nNine of ten third-party or independent presidential tickets did not meet the signature petition requirements set by the Central Election Commission, and were disqualified from the election. Including Gou, only five presidential candidates and their running mates attempted to submit signatures. The rest are as follows:[52]\n\nElection campaign [ edit ]\n\nA Lai-Hsiao election poster pictured on a bus in January 2024.\n\nThroughout the election campaign, almost all polls showed Vice President Lai Ching-te winning the election by a plurality, with the rest of the vote being split between the KMT and TPP.[53] Lai's lead increased in September 2023, when Terry Gou announced his own independent bid for the presidency.[54] In August 2023, amid campaigning, Lai Ching-te went to Paraguay for an official visit in his capacity as vice president, with two stopovers in the United States.[55] Lai insisted he was not campaigning during the trips.[56] In late October, China opened an investigation into Foxconn, after Chinese tax authorities conducted an audit of the company's subsidiaries in the Guangdong and Jiangsu provinces.[57] Within the final weeks preceding the election, Lai's lead narrowed as the publication of opinion polls ceased.[58]\n\nLai and Hsiao held their first rally together on 26 November 2023, where they called the election a \"fight for the survival of the country\".[59] Lai's campaign used his late pet dog and Hsiao's pet cats as campaign mascots, the cats allegedly referencing Hsiao's \"cat warrior\" diplomacy.[60] Thousands of Taiwanese academics voiced their support for Lai, arguing the DPP would continue to safeguard the country's democracy.[61] Hou of the KMT said Lai was \"paying lip service\" to voters, and described the election as a choice between war or peace. The TPP generally opted for smaller rallies, which primarily attracted younger voters.[59] As usual, temples were visited by party candidates so as to interact with voters.[62]\n\nUnrealized KMT\u2013TPP joint ticket [ edit ]\n\nIn late 2023, talks of a possible joint ticket between the KMT and TPP began.[63] It was initially unclear if the KMT's Hou Yu-ih and the TPP's Ko Wen-je would join as a ticket, let alone who would be the nominee for president and vice president once a joint ticket was announced.[53] The DPP's Lai stated he would be able to take on the challenge of a joint ticket, and criticized the coalition plans, arguing the two parties do not share enough similarity in ideology.[64][failed verification] In November, Ko said that deciding who would lead the ticket as the presidential nominee was the 'only hurdle' remaining in forming the ticket.[53] On 13 November, the KMT and TPP agreed to use polling to determine the composition of the joint presidential ticket.[65] The order of the joint ticket was to be chosen based on opinion polls and publicly announced on 18 November,[66] but the two sides were unable to come to an agreement on that date.[67] On 18 November, the original deal collapsed following a dispute regarding the polling.[68] The KMT and TPP were reportedly unable to come to a consensus surrounding the margins of error.[69] Despite the initial collapse, there were still attempts to form a pan-blue coalition ticket. Terry Gou, who himself had run in the KMT primary, was informally invited to talks as well.[70] A televised press conference between Hou You-ih, Ko Wen-je, Terry Gou, as well as Eric Chu and Ma Ying-jeou took place on 23 November.[71] The press conference did not yield any agreement between any of the involved parties, and was described as \"bizarre\".[72][73] On 24 November, the deadline for candidate registration, each party announced their own vice presidential candidate, eliminating any chance of a pan-blue ticket.[74]\n\nIssues in focus [ edit ]\n\nThe TPP opted for smaller rallies (pictured).\n\nEnergy and economic policy [ edit ]\n\nHou and Ko both support gradually increasing the use of nuclear energy, (Hou supported 18% use by 2050) while the DPP's Lai supports eliminating nuclear energy by 2050. All three candidates agreed to increase use of renewables.[75] The KMT vice presidential nominee criticized the use of solar energy, preferring nuclear power instead.[76] Cost of living featured as a topic of debate, with a third of voters saying economic issues were pressing. Both Lai and Hou pledged to increase the minimum wage.[77] Lai acknowledged there were shortcomings in the government's approach to help younger people in the country, promising minimum wage would increase from NT$26,400 to NT$27,470 by 2025.[78] Additionally, Lai vowed to offer financial support to Taiwanese start-up companies, saying he would allocate NT$150 billion for small business investment.[79] Ko offered plans to integrate hospitals and bolster the medical field, while the KMT's Hou promised to address mental health.[76]\n\nSocial issues [ edit ]\n\nRights groups such as the Awakening Foundation criticized all three major party candidates for not doing enough to promote gender equality, which includes reducing working hours for parents, the gender pay gap, and child care.[80] In October, Vice President Lai joined a Pride Parade in Taipei, becoming one of the most senior government officials to do so.[81] TPP candidate Ko Wen-je had historically been opposed to same-sex marriage.[82] Both Lai Ching-te and Ko Wen-je signed a pledge organized by the Taiwan Equality Campaign promising to promote and support sexual diversity and LGBT equality.[83] Hou criticized Lai for his lack of a consistent position on capital punishment, which most polls show has been widely supported by the public. At the presidential debate, Lai stated although he was personally opposed to the death penalty, it would remain in place under his administration due to broad public support.[84]\n\nCross-Strait relations and national defense [ edit ]\n\nIn China, Xi Jinping had further asserted his power, having secured an unprecedented third term as General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, the most powerful position in China.[85] The 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine had also prompted fears of an escalation between Mainland China and Taiwan.[86] The CIA also warned not to underestimate the potential of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan.[87] After incumbent President Tsai Ing-wen visited the United States and met with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in April 2023, the Chinese military responded with military exercises near Taiwan.[88] When KMT nominee Hou Yu-ih visited the US, he encouraged the Biden administration to make clear their commitment to defending Taiwan. Later in December, Hou stated he would seek closer ties with China, and criticized the Tsai administration's approach to China.[89] Lai asserted Taiwanese sovereignty, but said a formal declaration of independence would be unnecessary. He also said he would be willing to work with the Chinese government, but only if they renounce any intentions to use force against Taiwan.[90] In November 2023, Lai argued that closer economic ties with like-minded countries could maintain Taiwan's sovereignty while preventing escalation of conflict.[91]\n\nThe DPP generally favored a continuation of the status quo of cross-strait relations coupled by strengthening ties with the United States. Lai did not rule out dialogue with China, but described Taiwanese sovereignty as 'a fact', making any declaration of independence unnecessary.[92] The KMT believed economic links with mainland China and more dialogue would preserve peace between the two.[77] Lai's past self-identification as a \"worker for Taiwanese independence\" led to criticism from both Hou and Ko; Lai argued that Taiwan is a sovereign nation under the name the Republic of China.[58] Lai accused the opposition of befriending the Chinese Communist Party instead of countering them.[58] China's Taiwan Affairs Council described the DPP ticket as a \"separatist duo\". TPP candidate Ko stated that Taiwan should be a bridge between the US and China, rather than what he described as a pawn. Outgoing President Tsai of the DPP highlighted China's one country two systems doctrine with Hong Kong as an example of what could happen if Taiwan were to reunify with mainland China. Polls showed most Taiwanese preferred the status quo.[93] In response to former KMT President Ma Ying-jeou's comments stating Taiwan must rely on Xi Jinping's willingness to not invade, Lai cautioned against trusting the Chinese government; instead he reiterated his plans to strengthen national defense.[94] Again outgoing Tsai reminded voters of Hong Kong's place in China, arguing on 12 January 2024 that greater security would act as the best deterrent to any forceful reunification.[95]\n\nIn 2023, the Ministry of Defense commissioned the building of the first Haikun-class submarine. Launched in September 2023, it is set to enter service by 2025.[96] In an August 2023 interview with Bloomberg, Lai described a strong military capacity as being a form of deterrence against potential Chinese aggression.[90] In October, Lai said that Taiwan's armed forces must be able to safeguard the country.[91] The Chinese government sanctioned five American-based companies for their sale of arms to Taiwan's military one week before the election.[97]\n\nElection interference [ edit ]\n\nLai campaign headquarters in Kaohsiung, in December 2023.\n\nThousands of cases related to election interference were opened by Taiwanese authorities, implicating more than 3,000 individuals. There were 1,430 cases of election gambling and 353 cases involving misinformation. Illegal gains from gambling and bribes exceeded NT$45.11 million (US$1.45 million).[98] Over 40 people were detained under various charges. Another investigation uncovered a large but isolated network of inauthentic social media accounts that promoted the KMT and attacked Ko Wen-je out of the concern that Ko would become a spoiler candidate.[99][100]\n\nInvolving China [ edit ]\n\nHundreds of people were arrested under the Anti-Infiltration Act. Some of them received money from China, made trips there, or subsidized others to travel to the mainland.[98] Ten Taiwanese soldiers were allegedly paid by China to make surrender videos, and one of them was reportedly offered millions to defect in a military helicopter.[100] Taiwanese intelligence reported that China coordinated disinformation campaigns on social media to influence the election.[101] According to the BBC, these efforts were meant to drive a wedge between Taiwan and the US, portraying the latter as unreliable regarding defense. Most sources of disinformation, however, were credited to Taiwanese groups favorable to China.[102]\n\nDebates [ edit ]\n\nDebates for presidential candidates and vice presidential candidates were announced on 8 December. These were organized by eleven Taiwanese media corporations including Taiwan's Public Television Service as the host, and include all three candidates for president and vice president, respectively.[19][103] The presidential and vice-presidential debates were held on 30 December and 1 January respectively.[104][14] Prior to the debates, Central Election Commission organized several televised policy presentations on 20, 26, and 28 December for presidential candidates and on 22 December for vice presidential candidates.[15][16][17]\n\nIn the presidential policy presentations and only debate, Lai and Hou both sparred over cross-strait relations, with the two disagreeing on how to approach China. Hou also accused the DPP of corruption and criticized the party's handling of COVID-19.[105] He repeatedly attacked Lai over his past support for Taiwanese independence, and reiterated the need for dialogue with China. He also rejected any possibility of a one country, two systems reunification plan for Taiwan.[106] Lai in contrast compared the KMT backed 1992 Consensus with China with Hong Kong's one country, two systems model with China. He claimed annexing Taiwan is China's national policy, and cautioned against embracing their ideals. Simultaneously, he stated the importance of a peaceful Taiwan Strait.[107] He stated his support for bolstering self-defense, increasing use of renewable energy, and the implementation of policies for strengthening the economy. Ko attempted to appeal to the youth, addressing housing, wages and other issues. He said he too was open to dialogue with the Chinese government.[108] Notably, Hou spoke in Taiwanese Hokkien on numerous occasions.[109]\n\nIn the Vice Presidential presentations and debate, Wu repeatedly stressed her experience working with the US and strengthening trade, while Jaw called the DPP's Lai a \"terrorist\". Jaw was also subject to a gaffe in which he accidentally referred to Lai as his \"boss\". Hsiao criticized her opponents for questioning her Taiwanese nationality, and also accused them of being overly reliant on China for economic prosperity.[110] Trade and concerns over China played large roles in all vice presidential debates and presentations.[111] The debate in particular focussed on trade, energy and foreign policy.[112] New Bloom Magazine declared the Vice Presidential debate as a \"clear win\" for Hsiao.[113]\n\nForeign observations [ edit ]\n\nThe elections were described as \"crucial\" regarding foreign policy.[114][115] The election was also described as being \"closely watched\" due to its impact on cross-strait ties.[58] CNN stated the election 'could change the world'.[116]\n\nOpinion polling [ edit ]\n\nResults [ edit ]\n\nAll election results were released at 22:00 on 13 January, and showed that Lai Ching-te had won with 40.05% of the vote.[117]\n\nResults by Administrative division [ edit ]\n\nAftermath [ edit ]\n\nDPP supporters gathered outside campaign headquarters as Lai gave his victory speech.\n\nAt around 20:00, Hou conceded to Lai in an address to his supporters at his campaign headquarters in New Taipei. He also apologized for failing to end eight years of DPP rule.[118] At 20:04, Ko addressed his supporters at his campaign headquarters in New Taipei. He said that the TPP's campaign showed the world that Taiwan was no longer dominated by the \"green\" and \"blue\" camps and urged his supporters to continue their hard work for the next election.[119]\n\nIn a social media reflection over the campaign on 15 January, Hou's running mate Jaw Shau-kong said that in order to win future elections, the Kuomintang needed to undertake major reforms such as \"incorporating a bit of socialist [messaging] on wealth equality,\" ensuring that its membership better reflected Taiwan's demographics, and promoting greater democracy and transparency in its nomination system.[120] At a Central Standing Committee meeting of the Kuomintang on 17 January, its leadership acknowledged that although 60% of the electorate voted against the DPP, the failure to establish a joint ticket with the TPP undermined its chances of winning the election. They also attributed the Kuomintang's defeat to its failure to attract support from younger voters as well as those living in southern Taiwan, where it lost to the DPP by 700,000 votes, and what it called the \"apparatus of the state\" manipulated by the outgoing government in favor of Lai. Amid calls within the Kuomintang for his resignation, party chairman Eric Chu insisted that he would \"shoulder all responsibilities and endure humiliations to stay in the position until the end of his term\" in 2025.[121]\n\nDuring his victory speech, Lai thanked Hou and Ko for conceding, as well as the Taiwanese people for \"writing a new chapter in our democracy\" and taking a stand against authoritarianism, adding that they \"successfully resisted efforts from external forces to influence this election.\" He expressed hope for \"healthy and orderly\" exchanges with China but also pledged to defend Taiwan from \"continuing threats and intimidation\" from its neighbour.[122] He called on China to \"recognize the new situation, and understand that only peace benefits both sides of the strait.\"[123]\n\nOutgoing president Tsai Ing-wen congratulated Lai and his running mate Hsiao Bi-kim and said the elections expressed Taiwan's \"determination to maintain democracy\" and their \"love for Taiwan and for freedom\".[124]\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Taiwan alleged that China encouraged Nauru to shift diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China, pressured ASEAN countries to \"echo the fictitious narrative of the so-called 'one China principle\" and instigated statements made by the Solomon Islands, the Maldives, and Bangladesh disparaging Taiwan's sovereignty status.[125]\n\nInternational reactions [ edit ]\n\nPeople's Republic of China [ edit ]\n\nDuring the voting, the hashtag \"Taiwan election\" became a top-trending topic in Weibo, at one point reaching 163.2 million views before it was removed. Chinese state media also provided little coverage on the vote.[126]\n\nFollowing Lai's victory, the Taiwan Affairs Office said the elections \"cannot stop the unstoppable trend of the eventual reunification of the motherland\" and that the DPP \"cannot represent the mainstream public opinion\" in Taiwan.[127] A mainland China foreign ministry spokesperson said that regardless of the election result, \"the basic fact that there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is part of China will not change.\"[123] In response, the Taiwan-run Mainland Affairs Council urged Beijing to \"fully respect the election results and Taiwan's public opinion,\" and \"rationally assess\" the post-election situation.[128]\n\nThe government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) lodged formal complaints after Japan and the United States expressed congratulations to Lai, warning them against interfering in \"China's internal affairs\", sending wrong signals to Taiwanese independence advocates, and violating pledges to maintain only unofficial ties with Taiwan.[129][130] It also made d\u00e9marches to Singapore after its foreign ministry welcomed and congratulated the election,[131] and summoned Philippine ambassador Jaime FlorCruz following President Bongbong Marcos' congratulatory message to Lai.[132]\n\nDuring election day, eight Chinese military aircraft and six naval vessels were detected by Taiwan's Defense Ministry.[133] On 14 January, a day after Lai's victory was confirmed, four Chinese military vessels and a high-altitude balloon were detected around Taiwan.[134]\n\nOther countries [ edit ]\n\nSupranational organizations [ edit ]\n\nEuropean Union: A statement issued by a spokesperson for foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said it \"welcomed\" Taiwan's presidential election and \"congratulates all the voters who participated in this democratic exercise\". It also expressed concern about \"growing tensions in the Taiwan Strait and opposes any unilateral attempt to change the status quo.\" [ 164 ]\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\nMedia related to Republic of China presidential election, 2024 at Wikimedia Commons",

        "text": "Inaugural Address of ROC 16th-term President Lai Ching-te\nInaugural Address of ROC 16th-term President Lai Ching-te\n\nInaugural Address of ROC 16th-term President Lai Ching-te\n\nOn the morning of May 20, ROC 16th-term President Lai Ching-te, the first lady, and Vice President Bi-khim Hsiao attended inaugural celebrations in the plaza fronting the Presidential Office Building. President Lai delivered his inaugural address titled \u201cBuilding a democratic, peaceful, and prosperous new Taiwan.\u201d\n\nThe following is a translation of President Lai\u2019s remarks:\n\nVice President Bi-khim Hsiao, esteemed heads of state and guests from our allies, distinguished ambassadors and representatives, all visiting dignitaries, dear friends watching live on television and online, fellow citizens across the country: Good morning.\n\nWhen I was young, I was determined to practice medicine and save lives. When I went into politics, I was determined to transform Taiwan.\n\nNow, standing here, I am determined to strengthen the nation. With an unwavering heart, I accept the responsibility the people have entrusted to me as the 16th-term president of the Republic of China. In accordance with the Republic of China Constitution system, I will take on that solemn responsibility of leading the nation bravely forward.\n\nOn this day in 1949, martial law went into effect in Taiwan, and Taiwan plunged into a dark era of authoritarian rule.\n\nOn this day in 1996, Taiwan\u2019s first democratically elected president took the oath of office, conveying to the international community that the Republic of China Taiwan is a sovereign, independent nation in which sovereignty lies in the hands of the people.\n\nOn this day in 2024, having completed our third transition of political power, Taiwan officially commences, for the first time, the third consecutive term of the same political party in office. We also set sail into a new era that is full of challenges, yet also brimming with limitless hope.\n\nThis journey came about as a result of the valiant sacrifices and devotion of the many generations of people of this land. Although it was an arduous one, we made it through.\n\nNow, we not only witness the beginning of a new administration, but also usher in another hard-earned victory for democracy.\n\nMany people have interpreted my and Vice President Bi-khim Hsiao\u2019s election victory as \u201cbreaking the eight-year curse,\u201d referring to the fact that no political party has been able to remain in office for over two terms. But the reality is that in a democracy, the people have the final say. There is no such thing as a \u201ccurse\u201d in any election. It is simply that the people put the ruling party under the toughest of tests, choosing the nation\u2019s future in the most genuine way.\n\nI want to thank former President Tsai Ing-wen, former Vice President Chen Chien-jen, and the administrative team for their hard work over these past eight years. You have all helped build a solid base for Taiwan\u2019s development. Let\u2019s give them a big round of applause!\n\nI also want to thank my fellow citizens once again for your support, for refusing to be swayed by external forces, for resolutely defending democracy, for pressing onward without turning back, and for turning a new page in Taiwan\u2019s history.\n\nEvery day of my term, I will strive to prove myself as someone in whom you can trust and count on, by acting justly, showing mercy, and being humble, and by treating our people as family. The new administration will work tirelessly and to the best of our ability, as all the nation\u2019s people put us to the test. We will also pursue continuous reform, shaping a new face for Taiwanese politics.\n\nI. Coordination and cooperation between the executive and legislative branches to advance national policy\n\nIn February this year, a new Legislative Yuan was sworn in. This is the first time in 16 years that no party has an absolute majority. In the face of this new political landscape, some are feeling anticipation, while others are anxious.\n\nI want to say to everyone, that this new structure is a result of the people\u2019s choice. Looking at it with a different frame of mind, a lack of absolute majority means that the ruling and opposition parties are now all able to share their ideas, and that we will be undertaking the nation\u2019s challenges as one.\n\nHowever, Taiwan\u2019s people have high expectations for rational governance among political parties. Apart from competition, parties should also believe in cooperation. Only then can the nation continue down a stable path.\n\nThe Legislative Yuan should observe procedural justice. The majority should respect the minority, while the minority accepts majority rule. Only then can we avoid conflict and maintain a stable and harmonious society.\n\nIn a democratic society, the interests of the people come first \u2013 that is the root of democracy. Likewise, national interests come before the interests of parties \u2013 that is the sacred duty of each political party. When ruling or opposition parties put forth legislation that conforms with our Constitution; when we uphold the spirit of \u201cpeople above all\u201d and \u201cnation above party,\u201d national policy will naturally and smoothly progress.\n\nPremier Cho Jung-tai (\u5353\u69ae\u6cf0) will lead the cabinet, and prioritize solving issues which benefit society and reflect consensus among ruling and opposition parties. He will respond to public opinion and address the issues people care about with proactive efforts and innovative thinking, and thus serve the people of Taiwan.\n\nToday, recovery work following the April 3 earthquake is still underway. I would like to once again express my sympathy and condolences to the victims and their families. I also want to thank all our citizens who have assisted in the earthquake response and reconstruction efforts, as well as the international community for their concern and support.\n\nThe central government has already drawn up plans to funnel NT$28.55 billion into reconstruction and industry stimulus. This will help the people of Hualien return to their normal lives as quickly as possible.\n\nI have high hopes for the future of cooperation between the central and local governments, as well as coordination between the executive and legislative branches. I also hope to work hard alongside all the people of Taiwan to further entrench our democracy, maintain peace in the Indo-Pacific, and boost global prosperity.\n\nII. Democratic Taiwan as a global beacon\n\nMy fellow citizens: Democracy, peace, and prosperity form Taiwan\u2019s national roadmap. And they are also our links to the world.\n\nAs an important link in the global chain of democracies, a glorious era of Taiwan\u2019s democracy has arrived.\n\nSince Taiwan first held direct presidential elections, we have grown to become one of the world\u2019s most vibrant democracies. We have continued to enhance human rights, and show the world our values of democracy and freedom.\n\nTaiwan was the first country in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage.\n\nTaiwan showed that democracy outperforms authoritarianism in fighting the pandemic.\n\nWhether in terms of democracy or freedom, Taiwan is consistently highly ranked among Asian nations. Democratic Taiwan is already a global beacon. And this honor belongs to all the people of Taiwan.\n\nAs we move forward, my administration will continue using Taiwan\u2019s democratic vitality as a force for good, to promote national development and deepen international cooperation.\n\nIn terms of internal affairs, I will value meritocracy, and uphold honesty and diligence. I will practice democratic governance, and establish an open government. In the spirit of transparency and rule by the people, I encourage the populace to participate in public policy, and will continue to promote a voting age of 18. Together, we will fulfill our vision for our nation.\n\nAs for international affairs, we will continue working with other democratic nations to form a democratic community, and share our experiences across a range of fields. We will work together to combat disinformation, strengthen democratic resilience, address challenges, and allow Taiwan to become the MVP of the democratic world.\n\nIII. Democratic Taiwan as a pilot for global peace\n\nPeace is priceless, and war has no winners. Next year, we will mark the 80th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. As with other nations, Taiwan walked a difficult path for post-war revitalization, before getting to where we are today. No one wants these achievements to be destroyed by war.\n\nToday, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and conflict between Israel and Hamas continue to shake the whole world. And China\u2019s military actions and gray-zone coercion are considered the greatest strategic challenges to global peace and stability.\n\nTaiwan is strategically positioned in the first island chain, and what affects us here affects global geopolitical development. Even as early as 1921, Chiang Wei-shui (\u8523\u6e2d\u6c34) said that Taiwan is a frontline guardian of world peace. Now, in 2024, Taiwan\u2019s role is even more significant.\n\nThere is already a strong international consensus, that peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait are indispensable to global security and prosperity.\n\nTo adapt to today\u2019s complicated international landscape, countries around the world have been actively cooperating to maintain regional peace and stability.\n\nJust last month, the United States made into law the Indo-Pacific Security Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2024. This will provide the Indo-Pacific region with additional security and assistance, thereby supporting the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait.\n\nWe thank nations around the world for their consideration and support for Taiwan. We would also like to declare to all that democracy and freedom are Taiwan\u2019s unwavering commitments. Peace is the only option. And prosperity, gained through lasting peace and stability, is our objective.\n\nThe future of cross-strait relations will have a decisive impact on the world. This means that we, who have inherited a democratic Taiwan, are pilots for peace. Our government will uphold the Four Commitments, neither yield nor provoke, and maintain the status quo.\n\nI also want to call on China to cease their political and military intimidation against Taiwan, share with Taiwan the global responsibility of maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait as well as the greater region, and ensure the world is free from the fear of war.\n\nTaiwanese are a peace-loving people who treat others with kindness. I have always believed that if the leader of a country puts the people\u2019s welfare above all, then peace in the Taiwan Strait, mutual benefits, and prosperous coexistence would be common goals.\n\nTherefore, I hope that China will face the reality of the Republic of China\u2019s existence, respect the choices of the people of Taiwan, and in good faith, choose dialogue over confrontation, exchange over containment, and under the principles of parity and dignity, engage in cooperation with the legal government chosen by Taiwan\u2019s people. This can start from the resumption of tourism on a reciprocal basis, and enrollment of degree students in Taiwanese institutions. Let us together pursue peace and mutual prosperity.\n\nMy fellow citizens: As we pursue the ideal of peace, we must not harbor any delusions. So long as China refuses to renounce the use of force against Taiwan, all of us in Taiwan ought to understand, that even if we accept the entirety of China\u2019s position and give up our sovereignty, China\u2019s ambition to annex Taiwan will not simply disappear.\n\nIn face of the many threats and attempts of infiltration from China, we must demonstrate our resolution to defend our nation, and we must also raise our defense awareness and strengthen our legal framework for national security. This means actively promoting the Four Pillars of Peace action plan: strengthened national defense; improved economic security; stable and principled cross-strait leadership; and values-based diplomacy. By standing side-by-side with other democratic countries, we can form a peaceful global community that can demonstrate the strength of deterrence and prevent war, achieving our goal of peace through strength.\n\nIV. Democratic Taiwan as a force for global prosperity\n\nTaiwan needs the world, just as the world needs Taiwan. Taiwan is not just opening a door to the world \u2013 Taiwan is already on the world\u2019s center stage.\n\nAs we look toward our future, we know that semiconductors will be indispensable. And the AI wave has already swept in. Taiwan has already mastered advanced semiconductor manufacturing, and we stand at the center of the AI revolution. We are a key player in supply chains for global democracies. For these reasons, Taiwan has an influence on global economic development, as well as humanity\u2019s well-being and prosperity.\n\nMy fellow citizens: The future of the Republic of China Taiwan will be decided by its 23 million people. The future we decide is not just the future of our nation, but the future of the world.\n\nWe must walk on the right path, and our industries must make every effort, so that we may be a force for global prosperity. With every step forward that Taiwan takes, the world takes a step forward with us.\n\nWhen I served as premier and vice president, I visited the various industries throughout Taiwan. I know well what our industry needs, and also what it is capable of. So, going forward, the government, working closely with the private sector, will take a threefold approach to further Taiwan\u2019s development.\n\nThe first is having a clear view for our future, and making Taiwan smart and sustainable.\n\nAs we face the dangers of climate change, we must be resolved in our transition to net-zero emissions by the year 2050. As we meet the global challenges of adopting more and more smart technologies, we in Taiwan, a \u201csilicon island,\u201d must do all we can to expedite Taiwan\u2019s transformation into an \u201cAI island.\u201d We must adapt AI for industry and step up the pace of AI innovation and applications. We must also adapt industry for AI and use AI\u2019s computational power to make our nation, our military, our workforce, and our economy stronger.\n\nIt is similarly crucial that we develop an economic model driven by innovation. Through our two-pronged approach of promoting digital transformation and net-zero transition, we will assist small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as they upgrade and transform, and we will seek inclusive growth, so as to create a new Taiwan that is smarter and more sustainable \u2013 a second Taiwan Miracle.\n\nWhile we invest in innovation and nurture the next hidden champions, we must also make bold investments in quantum computing, robotics, the metaverse, precision medicine, and other advanced technologies, thus giving our young people the opportunity to pursue their dreams and solidifying Taiwan\u2019s leading position in the future global landscape.\n\nThe second is setting our sights on the space industry while further developing our strengths as a maritime nation.\n\nOur sights are set on making Taiwan the Asian hub of UAV supply chains for global democracies, and developing the next generation of medium- and low-orbit communications satellites, bringing Taiwan\u2019s space and aerospace industries squarely into the international sphere.\n\nAt the same time, we will also explore and develop our strengths as a maritime nation, deepen our connections with the ocean, and invest more in marine science and technology research, thereby driving the development of our maritime industries. Altogether, this will make Taiwan a much stronger nation, and it will open up new horizons for the development of Taiwan\u2019s economy and industry. The possibilities are truly limitless.\n\nThe third is to help our enterprises expand their presence and market internationally.\n\nTaiwan has officially applied to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), and we will continue to engage actively in regional economic integration. We will endeavor to sign bilateral investment agreements with other democracies around the world and further deepen our trade partnerships. We will also work to resolve the carbon tax issue and thus open the path for further industrial development.\n\nTaiwan must hold firm its key position in the global supply chain and seize the business opportunities that come as a result of geopolitical changes. We aim to develop Five Trusted Industry Sectors, namely semiconductors, AI, military, security and surveillance, and next-generation communications; we also aim to improve the investment environment, welcome Taiwanese businesses abroad to come back and invest in Taiwan, and encourage local firms to expand their investments and set even deeper roots here in Taiwan.\n\nHere today, I want to assure our friends from all different sectors: Just as you all are committed to be the best in your respective areas, the government is also committed to providing assistance so that you can expand your global presence and international markets from a solid base here in Taiwan.\n\nTaiwan is eminently capable of being a thriving global economic powerhouse. Wherever the sun shines around the world, there are Taiwanese companies stimulating local development, while also enriching the livelihoods of the Taiwanese people.\n\nV. Sympathizing with the joys and the concerns of the people\n\nIt is my firm belief that the fruits of economic development ought to be enjoyed by all the people of our nation. In the coming days of my presidency, I will launch the National Project of Hope and expand investment in society, through which I aim to shape a Taiwanese society with more love and moral courage. It will be a society in which young people have a vision of hope, people in their prime have the means to realize their dreams, the elderly can enjoy their days in happiness, and the disadvantaged can find the care they need. A society in which all people, at every stage of life, will be able to receive from the government the support they need.\n\nChildcare, long-term care, and social housing services will continue to be expanded. Prices of commodities and housing, as well as the wealth gap, will be addressed. The safety and security of our food, our roads, our schools, and our social safety net will all be enhanced. And our reform efforts in education, the judicial system, and transitional justice will continue.\n\nI understand the concerns and expectations of the people of Taiwan. As to the issues you are concerned with and the reform society needs, the government will do its utmost to achieve solutions.\n\nEveryone is working hard for higher pay. I will work to drive industrial upgrading and create an even better wage environment.\n\nEveryone is hoping for more effective public safety. I will crack down on corruption and organized crime, guns, drugs, and fraud.\n\nEveryone is wanting a stable supply of electricity. I will initiate our second energy transition, push for the development of more forms of green energy and smart grids, and help to make our electrical power generation system more resilient.\n\nEveryone is concerned about the financing of labor insurance. I repeat here today: Labor insurance will not fail under our government.\n\nEveryone is stressing the importance of transportation safety. I will help create a human-friendly transportation environment, putting an end to Taiwan\u2019s bad reputation as a \u201cpedestrian hell.\u201d\n\nEveryone is hoping that the government can help lighten the load for family caregivers and work to solve the labor shortage issue. I will do my utmost to arrive at solutions.\n\nAll of us, as we walk into the future, want a more resilient Taiwan, a Taiwan that can respond adequately to such crises as infectious disease and natural disasters, a Taiwan that can quicken the pace of urban renewal and the repair of dilapidated and dangerous old buildings.\n\nAll of us are also hoping for a healthier Taiwan. With my own expertise in medicine, I hope to bring together the strengths of other fields to beat cancer. I will establish a ministry of physical education and sports development to bring sports and athletics more into the lives of the people. I will also ensure that our National Health Insurance system remains sustainable, which will help our people live longer and healthier.\n\nThe Taiwan of tomorrow will preserve its diverse ecosystem, its diverse ethnic culture, and achieve sustainability, to create a better nation.\n\nThe Taiwan of tomorrow will have a more diverse innovation economy, a more widespread use of digital technology applications; it will be more competitive and bilingual; it will have a stronger public support service system; it will be more respectful of gender equality; it will ensure that the people are guaranteed their rights.\n\nThe Taiwan of tomorrow will allow each municipality to develop out of its own unique characteristics and promote revitalization of local industries; we will achieve the goal of a Taiwan with balanced development where all can live and work in peace and happiness.\n\nVI. With greater solidarity, we become stronger as a nation\n\nMy dear compatriots, each and every one of you contributes a necessary part to our future development. In this era of globalization and wide-ranging competition, no one country can go it alone; and no society, if it is divided within, can successfully meet these challenges.\n\nIf we are united, we can walk with more confident strides. And when we support one another, our steps will take us further. For our nation to endure and progress, I will bring us together through the strength of democracy, for greater solidarity and a stronger nation.\n\nI think it is apparent to us all: We have a nation insofar as we have sovereignty. Right in the first chapter of our Constitution, it says that \u201cThe sovereignty of the Republic of China shall reside in the whole body of citizens,\u201d and that \u201cPersons possessing the nationality of the Republic of China shall be citizens of the Republic of China.\u201d These two articles tell us clearly: The Republic of China and the People\u2019s Republic of China are not subordinate to each other. All of the people of Taiwan must come together to safeguard our nation; all our political parties ought to oppose annexation and protect sovereignty; and no one should entertain the idea of giving up our national sovereignty in exchange for political power.\n\nAs more countries around the world publicly express their support for Taiwan\u2019s meaningful international participation, there is increasing proof that Taiwan is a Taiwan of the world; that Taiwan is a worthy and reliable force for global peace and prosperity.\n\nSo long as we identify with Taiwan, Taiwan belongs to us all \u2013 all of the peoples of Taiwan, regardless of ethnicity, irrespective of when we arrived. Some call this land the Republic of China, some call it the Republic of China Taiwan, and some, Taiwan; but whichever of these names we ourselves or our international friends choose to call our nation, we will resonate and shine all the same. So let us overcome our differences and stride forward, with our shared aspirations, to meet the world.\n\nVII. Taiwan greeting a new world, the world greeting a new Taiwan\n\nAs Taiwan engages more closely with the rest of the world, we welcome the world to come closer to Taiwan. Many new residents and foreign nationals have come and made Taiwan their home, writing a new chapter in Taiwan\u2019s story. To all of you, I give my sincere thanks and respect.\n\nHere today are many friends who have come quite a long way from their countries to join us. And many overseas compatriots are also here showing their support with their presence. So, why don\u2019t we let them all know how much we appreciate their support? Please give them a round of applause!\n\nTonight we will be welcoming our distinguished guests at a state banquet in Tainan, the city where 1624 marked Taiwan\u2019s links to globalization. Now, as we stand here 400 years after that historical moment in Tainan, we in Taiwan must all demonstrate confidence and bravely set course for the new world, so that the world may embrace a new Taiwan.\n\nOn that note, I want to ask each fellow citizen to praise our mother Taiwan, the land that nurtures and supports us all, and to work together to protect her, honor her, let the world embrace her, and allow her the international respect she deserves as a great nation.\n\nThank you.",

        "text": "9 more people killed in attacks on political candidates as violence escalates days before elections in Mexico\nTwo attacks against mayoral candidates in Mexico's June elections have left nine people dead in the southern state of Chiapas, the prosecutor's office in the organized crime-plagued region said Sunday.\n\nThe two candidates survived, though both were wounded, in the onslaughts Saturday night and early Sunday in the municipalities of Villa Corzo and Mapastepec, it said in a statement.\n\nThe attack in Mapastepec targeted the car driving Nicol\u00e1s Noriega, who is running to lead the municipal government. Noriega confirmed the attack to The Associated Press and said he was wounded and at least five people from his campaign were fatally shot.\n\nRunning under the country's ruling party, Morena didn't add more details and was noticeably shaken after the attack. Photos shared by local media showed a red truck dotted by bullet holes, and bloodied bodies lying in the trunk and on the ground.\n\n\"I deeply mourn the deaths of my friends, whose lives were taken in a cowardly manner. Evil is never going to reign in our hearts, because there are more of us who love life, who think of doing good,\" Noriega posted on Facebook Sunday. \"I'm asking all of society to unite to honor life.\"\n\nThe attacks marked an escalation of violence in Chiapas against politicians intending to seek office in the June 2 vote, when Mexicans will also elect a new president.\n\nLast week, six people, including a minor and mayoral candidate Lucero Lopez, were killed in an ambush after a campaign rally in the municipality of La Concordia, neighboring Villa Corzo.\n\nMore than two dozen politicians have been killed since September last year, according to the NGO Data Civica -- including one mayoral hopeful who was shot dead last month just as she began campaigning.\n\nThe toll increases to more than 50 people if relatives and other victims of those attacks are counted.\n\nThe prosecutor's office said the attack in Villa Corzo targeted a motorcade transporting Mayor Robertony Orozco, who is seeking reelection for the Morena party of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.\n\nThree people died in the attack, and another later in hospital.\n\nOrozco was shot in both legs, the statement said.\n\nMexico's president denies \"Chiapas is on fire\"\n\nSpiraling criminal violence has seen more than 450,000 people murdered in Mexico since the government of then-president Felipe Calderon launched a controversial military offensive against drug cartels in 2006.\n\nThe homicide rate has almost tripled to 23 cases per 100,000 inhabitants since then.\n\nMany Mexicans see insecurity as the most urgent challenge for the next government, according to surveys.\n\nElectoral campaigns in Chiapas are often violent, but the situation has deteriorated because of a war being waged between the Jalisco New Generation and Sinaloa cartels in a region known as La Frailesca, which includes Villa Corzo and La Concordia.\n\nThe cartels are fighting over drug trafficking routes and control of other criminal enterprises such as extortion.\n\nMapastepec is a key strategic area because of its proximity to the Pacific coast.\n\nLast week, 11 people were killed in mass shootings in a village in the township of Chicomuselo, Chiapas.\n\nThat is also the same area where in April the Morena presidential candidate, Claudia Sheinbaum, was intercepted by masked men during a tour of the Guatemalan border.\n\nThe security convoy of candidate Willy Ochoa, formed by patrols of the National Guard, State Police and private security, leaving the municipality of Las Rosas, Chiapas, Mexico. May 6, 2024. Victoria Razo for The Washington Post via Getty Images\n\nBecause of its strategic location, Chiapas is one of the three Mexican states with the highest levels of electoral violence, with 55 victims so far, according to the Mexican consulting firm Integralia. It trails only Guerrero and Michoac\u00e1n, two states at the heart of the Mexican cartel warfare.\n\nThe surge in violence in Chiapas proved embarrassing for President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador as he visited the border state Friday for a meeting with Guatemalan President Bernardo Ar\u00e9valo. L\u00f3pez Obrador.\n\nObrador has refused to confront the drug cartels and has largely minimized the problem of violence.\n\n\"There are those who maintain that Chiapas is on fire, no, as I've explained, the problem is in this region and we are going to solve it,\" Obrador said during a news briefing in Tapachula, Chiapas on Friday.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",
