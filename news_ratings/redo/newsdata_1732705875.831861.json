Ted Cruz and Democratic challenger Rep. Colin Allred as well as the presidential election, Texas is potentially at a major political crossroads that requires expert analysis and discussion.\n\nWe hosted a panel discussion with top Texas political journalists who analyzed the key factors shaping the 2024 Texas U.S. Senate and presidential elections. The event provided a comprehensive review of Texas\u2019 current political landscape, polling data, and strategies employed by the Cruz and Allred campaigns for the U.S. Senate race. Additionally, the panel assessed the prospects of Vice President Kamala Harris becoming the first Democratic presidential candidate to win Texas since Jimmy Carter in 1976 amid Texas\u2019 changing demographics and evolving political dynamics.\n\nThe event also spotlighted other crucial Texas races, including key congressional and state legislative contests that could shape the political balance of power in the state. With Nov. 5 looming, this event offered an engaging and timely discussion for political enthusiasts, students, and anyone interested in the future of Texas politics.\n\nIt was free and open to the public.\n\nFollow @BakerInstitute on X to join the conversation online with #BakerLive.\n\nRegistration\n\nRegistration has closed.\n\nBaker Institute events are powered by the generous contributions of our supporters.

        "text": "BBC debate show host offers her take on presidential election ahead of show taping in Philly\nFrom Philly and the Pa. suburbs to South Jersey and Delaware, what would you like WHYY News to cover? Let us know!\n\nThe BBC\u2019s flagship debate program, \u201cQuestion Time,\u201d hosted by British journalist Fiona Bruce, will be broadcast from the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia on Wednesday, October 9. This event will focus on the upcoming presidential election, featuring a live audience and panel discussion.\n\nThis marks the first broadcast of \u201cQuestion Time\u201d from the U.S. since 2008, providing viewers in the UK, U.S., and around the world with a unique perspective on the issues that matter to American voters in a critical battleground state, just weeks before the election. Bruce, who has hosted the BBC One program since January 2019, recently spoke with WHYY \u201cMorning Edition\u201d host Jennifer Lynn about Britain\u2019s view on the U.S. presidential race and the distinctiveness of her show.\n\n____\n\nFiona Bruce: Question Time is a panel show, and we have politicians from opposing parties on it, along with, sometimes, journalists, political commentators, or people in the public eye who are interested in and opinionated about politics. Then, we have an audience that is made up of people, some of whom support one party and some of whom support a different party. So, you get different opinions in the room. We record it live, and we do that every week in different places all around the United Kingdom.\n\nJennifer Lynn: And you receive questions from the audience. Do you read them ahead of time? Do you choose who\u2019s going to be asking the questions?\n\nFB: Well, we receive questions from the audience when they turn up, which is about an hour before we go to air, so it\u2019s all pretty last minute. You know, what we want to do is reflect what people are thinking there and then. Obviously, stories can change from day to day. The panelists do not know what the questions are. In between the questions, I go back and forth with the audience. People stick their hands up; they might want to ask something else that is relevant to that question. They might want to make a comment. They might want to say, \u201cThat sounds like rubbish to me\u201d or \u201cActually, that policy is not working for me.\u201d It\u2019s pretty lively, and it can be pretty passionate. It reflects what people\u2019s genuine views are.\n\nJL: You seem to know everything. What is your preparation level? What do you go through to get ready for a show?\n\nFB: Well, the thing is, I have been a news journalist; I\u2019ve been a news anchor as well for 25 years. You know, you kind of accumulate a bit of knowledge over those years. I have a fantastic team; there are only about four or five of us \u2014 quite small \u2014 and we prepare briefs on what we think the subjects might be. For example, at the moment, it\u2019s pretty obvious in the UK that people will want to talk about what\u2019s happening in the Middle East. And obviously, you know, it\u2019s a cumulative thing. But sometimes, people come along with questions, and it\u2019s quite last minute. It might be that lots of people are asking about something we do not expect, and then you\u2019ve just got to go for it, you know. You hope you do know enough to correct things that are wrong, but also just let the conversation flow.\n\nJL: Well, when Question Time is in Philadelphia at the National Constitution Center, the focus will be on our presidential election. Do you know who the panelists are going to be? I would assume you know by now, or is that still getting worked out?\n\nFB: Well, we know most of them. So, we have Madeleine Dean, a Democrat, you know, Pennsylvania Congresswoman. We\u2019ve got Brian Lanza, who\u2019s a senior advisor to Donald Trump and was part of his Communications Team in 2016 as well. We\u2019ve got a British journalist who\u2019s now a U.S. citizen, called Mehdi Hassan. He\u2019s been on the program before; he\u2019s fantastically knowledgeable. We have Anthony Zercher, who\u2019s our BBC America correspondent \u2014 a Texan guy who\u2019s fantastically knowledgeable. If there\u2019s anything I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m pretty sure he will know. We did have a Republican politician; he\u2019s just had to pull out for personal reasons related to him. So, we\u2019re just making sure we have a Republican politician on the panel too, because what is crucial is that it is balanced. You know, we are the BBC; that\u2019s a big thing for us, and we need to make sure that both sides of the debate are represented and are fairly heard on the panel, as well as in the audience.",

        "text": "\u2018Voter suppression has a long and troubling history in the US,\u2019 expert says\nEVANSTON, Ill. --- With the U.S. Presidential election just weeks away, efforts to purge voter rolls in key battleground states have prompted concern from the Department of Justice regarding possible violations of federal rules governing registered voter lists.\n\nWith the DOJ seeking to root out the ruler-breakers, voters are also absorbing details from the recent unsealing of the indictment against former President Donald Trump by U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan. The 165-page filing documents multiple incidents in which Trump continued to promote false claims that voter fraud caused him to lose the election, despite ample evidence to the contrary.\n\nProfessors of law and political science at Northwestern University are available to comment on voter suppression as a strategy to disenfranchise voters and influence election outcomes.\n\nTabitha Bonilla is an associate professor of political science, human development and social policy at Northwestern. Her research focuses on voting behavior, political messaging and political representation. She can be reached by contacting Stephanie Kulke at stephanie.kulke@northwestern.edu.\n\nQuote from Professor Bonilla\n\n\u201cRemoving voters from voter rolls is concerning when it disproportionately targets certain types of voters. Voters of color and older voters tend to be more likely to be removed from voter rolls than other types of voters, making it more difficult for their voices to be heard. Voter fraud is incredibly uncommon, and it\u2019s less clear to me that these moves are actually preserving the integrity of the ballot box more so than they are working to make it harder for certain people to vote.\u201d\n\nAlvin B. Tillery Jr. is a professor of political science and Black studies and the director of the Center for the Study of Diversity and Democracy at Northwestern. His research focuses on American politics, race relations and affirmative action and diversity policies. He can be reached at alvin.tillery@northwestern.edu or by contacting Stephanie Kulke at stephanie.kulke@northwestern.edu.\n\nQuote from Professor Tillery\n\n\u201cVoter suppression against Black voters has a long and troubling history in the United States. What we must understand is that gaining access to the franchise rights promised to Black Americans in the 15th Amendment was one of the primary forces that gave rise to the long civil rights movement. Between the passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965 and the SCOTUS decision that gutted it in 2013, there was a broad cultural consensus that the federal government should protect minority voters from voter suppression and that governments on all levels should be making it easier to vote. Unfortunately, as our population began to diversify and embrace more progressive stances on cultural issues, many in the Republican Party rightly began to realize that giving minority populations easy access to the ballot would make it harder for them to win elections.\n\n\u201cWe now stand at a point in history where the Republican Party as an entity has been given the greenlight by a Supreme Court packed with radical rightwing judges to suppress the voting rights of Black Americans, Latinos, college students and anyone else that they deem a threat to their electoral interests. We should see the Republican Party\u2019s voter suppression movement as just a larger piece of the puzzle that indicates their full embrace of an authoritarian turn.\u201d\n\nMichael Kang is a nationally recognized expert on election law. As the Class of 1940 Professor of Law at Northwestern Pritzker School of Law, his expertise includes campaign finance, voting rights, redistricting, judicial elections and corporate governance.

        "text": "Election 2024: Lying in Politics [Podcast]\nConversation Highlights\n\nResponses have been edited for clarity.\n\nOn his research which indicates republicans lie more\n\nIt's an uncomfortable thing to say. It's not something people want to hear. I'm sure that there will be blowback that I'll get about it, but it's something I think we need to face. It makes it really difficult to have a conversation about public policy if one side is denying the facts about issues such as immigration, climate, elections. We need to accept facts and then have an adult conversation, but we can't if one side is rejecting those facts.\n\nAlthough this book discusses this asymmetry in politics, it does not let Democrats off the hook. It's not like Democrats never lie, and I don't recall the exact percentage, but Democrats are still responsible for a huge share of lying. We shouldn't look upon this as just a Republican problem.\n\nOn his research methods\n\nImage Professor Bill Adair\n\nOne [method] was interviewing people about patterns and the reasons behind [lying], but also analyzing data from PolitiFact and The Washington Post fact-checker to look into the fact-checks that are published by them and see what sort of a disparity they showed.\n\nNow, this is not a surprise. You go back to tallies that various organizations have done of PolitiFact fact-checks going back to 2010, they have consistently shown that PolitiFact's fact-checks show more false ratings for Republicans than Democrats. And that indeed is what we found [in the new research].\n\nAnd to give us even more assurance that it was a party-wide problem, we removed Donald Trump from our data set and found that that pattern was still true with Donald [Trump] removed for both The Washington Post and PolitiFact [data sets]. So, in terms of the ratings by the fact-checkers, there's no question.\n\nOn whether the data shows selection bias\n\nI think conservative critics probably will still reject my conclusions here and will undoubtedly say there is selection bias. But if I just take my big case study from the book and say, \"Okay, is it possible that the fact-checkers are cherry-picking claims by Republicans and avoiding claims by Democrats that are false?\" I can tell you from my own experience at PolitiFact, we looked every day for false claims by both parties. That was our mission. We were trying to find things that were questionable by both parties. And anytime that anyone would say, \"Hey, this politician said this thing and it's not true,\" we would look into it.\n\nThis goes back to 2007 when PolitiFact started, and we just didn't find that there was the volume [of questionable statements] from Democrats that there was from Republicans. And even as I was researching the book, Republicans would say, \"Well, you never checked Hillary Clinton on the email server.\" Yes, we did. \"Oh, you never checked this Obama claim about Mitt Romney.\" Yes, we did. We gave Obama a \"Pants on Fire!\" [rating] for that.\n\nSo there really has always been a continuous effort by the fact-checkers to fact-check Democrats. And I truly believe that what you see in our data reflects reality. Now, will that convince my critics? No, I don't think it will because partisan feelings are very strong in this country.\n\non why politicians lie\n\nSo, I talked to everyone I could and asked them that question, and that included Republican politicians, former Republican politicians, former Republican political operatives, Democratic politicians, Democratic operatives. Everyone I interviewed for this book, I asked, \"Why is this the pattern?\" Many people traced it back to Newt Gingrich.\n\nThe rise of Newt Gingrich in the late-1990s -- many people said changed the culture of the Republican Party and created a mentality of \"anything goes.\" Sharp elbows came out and made the Republican politicians willing to say things that were not true because the ends justified the means. They wanted to win.\n\nNewt set the example with things he did as the leader in the House. And that sort of bled into the culture of the party.\n\nSome other factors - a partisan media that not only doesn't question the falsehoods, but also echoes them. And part of that is economics. As we saw in the Dominion [Voting Systems] case when Fox News did not repeat the election lies from the 2020 election, it lost viewers. It was bad business to tell the truth. So partisan media has found that there's money to be made in lying. And that has been a big factor, I think, in creating an atmosphere that has nurtured this culture.\n\nAnother factor [is] partisan gerrymandering. So, a Republican politician now is much more likely to be in a gerrymandered district and only has to answer to Republican voters. Well, those voters are a lot less likely to say, \"Hey, you were caught lying.\" So, [that politicians is] much more willing to just say what they want.\n\nAnd one other interesting statement -- this came from Denver Riggleman, the one term Republican congressman from Virginia. Denver said that the Republican Party sees itself as part of an epic cause and that in their sort of battle that anything is okay, including lying.\n\nSo put all those things together and you can really see a culture that says, \"Hey, it's okay to shade the truth.\n\nOn solutions to the issue\n\nOne [solution is] more journalism. I think if we can get more fact-checking of politicians, I think that can be helpful. Now, I think people will read that and say, \"Well, of course the fact-checker wants more fact-checking.\" One thing I would really like to see is more fact-checking, particularly by conservative outlets.\n\nWe did a study about a year and a half ago that we ended up calling \"Fact Deserts.\" (This is a takeoff on the term news deserts, which is an area where there is little or no news coverage.) And what we found is that there are large swaths of the country where there's no fact-checking. So that means that a governor, a state official, a state legislator, even a member of Congress, is often never fact checked.\n\nOn how we can change politicians' behavior\n\nCan we get politicians to reduce their lying? I'm hopeful for this reason: politicians lie because it's a calculation. They think that it pays off. They think that they get something out of it. So, if we can adjust that incentive, I think we can reduce lying.\n\nFirst you have to figure out what do politicians really need in their lives? Well, they need advertising to reach their voters. And one of the prime ways they do that these days is through tech companies and social media.\n\nIt's much more valuable now for them to [use social media to] advertise directly to people in their districts and the key demographic groups in their districts that they need to reach than it is to go to a big broad audience using a broadcast audience through television.\n\nSo, it's entirely possible to get the tech companies to charge more for politicians who have worse records for fact-checking and charge lower rates, for politicians who have good records for fact-checking.\n\nIf we could get the tech companies to be bold about this, the way that Facebook, now part of Meta, did when it established its third-party fact-checking program, that could happen.\n\nAnother way to do this, which borrows an idea from a conservative group, is to get politicians to sign a pledge. Grover Norquist, a real powerhouse in Washington, runs an organization called Americans for Tax Reform. Grover's had a huge effect on American politics by getting Republican politicians to sign a pledge that they will oppose tax increases. If we could get a similar pledge against lying in politics with a powerful character like Grover, we could turn lying into an unpopular thing.\n\nThere's no reason that the Republican Party couldn't become the party of honesty. There's nothing to say that lying is part of either party's foundational beliefs. So, either [party] could grab this [idea], and really it should be part of both parties' foundational beliefs. I am optimistic that if enough people care about this, that we could change the behavior.",

        "text": "Why Fracking Matters in the 2024 U.S. Election\nFracking, shorthand for hydraulic fracturing, has revolutionized the U.S. energy market over the past two decades, propelling the United States to become the world\u2019s largest producer of oil and natural gas. Ahead of the November election, however, fracking is again one of the most divisive political issues, with presidential nominees Kamala Harris and Donald Trump staking out differing views on climate goals, fossil fuels, and renewable energy. Grassroots opposition to the practice has led to bans in five states, even as it has become increasingly central to the economies of North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, and others.\n\nWhat is fracking?\n\nFracking is a technique used to extract natural gas and oil in shale formations or other forms of impermeable rock. It involves drilling deep below the earth\u2019s surface, sometimes as far as ten thousand feet, then drilling sideways for a mile or more. Since the oil and gas is trapped in dense layers of rock and cannot flow through a well by drilling alone, producers need to pump a high-pressure mixture of water, sand, and chemicals to open fractures in the rocks.\n\nThe fracturing technique was first introduced into commercial practice in 1949 before being combined with advances in horizontal drilling in the late 1990s. Together, the two processes have allowed producers to tap into deposits [PDF] that were previously inaccessible\u2014also referred to as \u201cunconventional\u201d sources.\n\nWhat is its role in the U.S. economy?\n\nSince 2008, the \u201cshale revolution\u201d has helped turn the United States into the world\u2019s leading oil producer after decades of falling output. The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates that in 2023, fracking added roughly three billion barrels of crude oil to U.S. production\u2014about 64 percent of the nation\u2019s total output.\n\nGrowing production enabled the United States to finally become a net energy exporter in 2019, the first time in sixty-seven years. It had already become a net exporter of natural gas in 2017, and those exports hit record levels in 2023. Economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas estimated in 2019 that the shale boom contributed 10 percent of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) growth between 2010 and 2015 by lowering fuel prices. Meanwhile, fracking\u2019s record on job creation is more contested; industry lobbying groups say unconventional drilling has created millions of jobs, but other experts argue the industry has produced fewer jobs than anticipated.\n\nThe World This Week A weekly digest of the latest from CFR on the biggest foreign policy stories of the week, featuring briefs, opinions, and explainers.

The Bakken Formation\u2014one of the country\u2019s top oil-producing regions which spans North Dakota, Montana, and part of southern Canada\u2014has turned North Dakota into a leading oil producer. The oil industry contributes 15 percent to state employment and almost 24 percent to state GDP, according to a 2021 study [PDF] funded by the American Petroleum Institute, an industry lobbying group. However, with Bakken in decline, the largest single source is now the Permian Basin that covers western Texas and southeastern New Mexico and produced close to six million barrels of oil per day in 2023.\n\nPennsylvania, the birthplace of the U.S. oil industry, now produces the second-most natural gas among U.S. states. Employment in the energy sector there accounted for roughly 5 percent [PDF] of statewide jobs in 2021, while oil and gas was responsible for nearly 9 percent of state GDP in 2023.\n\nIs fracking at odds with U.S. environmental goals?\n\nThere is ongoing debate over fracking\u2019s future amid plans for a clean energy transition. The Joe Biden administration has set ambitious climate goals that include achieving a carbon pollution\u2013free power sector by 2035 and a net\u2013zero emissions economy by 2050. Still, Biden and others have seen natural gas in particular, which produces less carbon emissions than oil or coal, as an important part of achieving those goals. Other proponents assert that growing oil and gas production has lowered energy costs and helped reduce U.S. dependence on foreign imports.\n\nBut critics point to fracking\u2019s other environmental harms. Natural gas is responsible for large amounts of methane, a greenhouse gas some eighty times more potent than carbon dioxide. The drilling process can also contaminate and deplete the water supply. Fracking has also been linked to seismic activity. In 2018, Texas recorded a 4.0 magnitude earthquake, the largest earthquake known to be induced by fracking activities, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nStrong local opposition has led five state legislatures\u2014in California, Maryland, New York, Vermont, and Washington\u2014to impose fracking bans. Meanwhile, Oregon and Massachusetts have put moratoriums on the practice.\n\nWhat are fracking\u2019s prospects?\n\nDespite growing investment in renewable energies\u2014which generate more than 21 percent of all U.S. electricity\u2014and softening demand for oil, some energy analysts say fracking\u2019s centrality to the U.S. market is likely to persist. Research from the U.S. Department of Energy suggests that without fracking, consumer oil and gas prices could potentially double [PDF].\n\nSteve Gonzales/Houston Chronicle/Getty Images Noble Energy employees work at a fracking site in Pecos, Texas, in 2017.\n\nStill, ahead of the 2024 U.S. presidential election, the two main parties have sharply diverging climate agendas that could shape the nation\u2019s fossil fuel use for years to come.\n\nFormer President Trump promises to \u201cdrill, baby, drill.\u201d He also opposes much of the Inflation Reduction Act, the Biden administration\u2019s signature climate law that budgets roughly $370 billion for emissions-reduction efforts, including tax credits and subsidies for clean energy projects. Meanwhile, Vice President Harris recently walked back a 2019 statement in favor of a fracking ban, arguing for \u201cdiverse sources\u201d to reduce reliance on foreign energy.\n\nStill, the dominance of fossil fuels shows no sign of slowing down. Despite Biden\u2019s clean energy initiatives, his administration has approved a range of new fossil fuel projects, including in northern Alaska, and overseen record levels of oil production. Under Biden, the United States has also set in motion a major expansion of its export infrastructure for liquefied natural gas (LNG). Growing LNG supplies allowed for quick redirection to European markets amid the continent\u2019s resulting energy supply crunch from Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.\n\nWill Merrow helped create the graphics for this In Brief.",

        "text": "Kamala Harris makes the case in 60 Minutes interview for why she should be president\nKamala Harris has been a candidate for president for just two-and-a-half months and the post convention \"honeymoon\" is over. With the election just 29 days away, Harris and her running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz face unrelenting attacks from Donald Trump, and the race remains extremely close.\n\nWe met the 59-year-old vice president this past week on the campaign trail and later at the vice president's residence in Washington, DC. We spoke about the economy and immigration, Ukraine, and China, but we began with the escalating war in the Middle East, one year after the Hamas terror attack on Israel.\n\nBill Whitaker: The events of the past few weeks have pushed us to the brink, if\u2014if not into an all-out regional war in the Middle East. What can the U.S. do at this point to stop this from spinning out of control?\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: Well, let's start with October 7. 1,200 people were massacred, 250 hostages were taken, including Americans, women were brutally raped, and as I said then, I maintain Israel has a right to defend itself. We would. And how it does so matters. Far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed. This war has to end.\n\nBill Whitaker: We supply Israel with billions of dollars in military aid, and yet Prime Minister Netanyahu seems to be charting his own course. The Biden-Harris administration has pressed him to agree to a ceasefire. He's resisted. You urged him not to go into Lebanon. He went in anyway. Does the U.S. have no sway over Prime Minister Netanyahu?\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: The work that we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit around making clear our principles.\n\nBill Whitaker: But it seems that Prime Minister Netanyahu is not listening.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: We are not gonna stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end.\n\nBill Whitaker: Do we have a--a real close ally in Prime Minister Netanyahu?\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: I think, with all due respect, the better question is do we have an important alliance between the American people and the Israeli people. And the answer to that question is yes.\n\nWhile the war in the Middle East has dominated recent headlines, it's the economy that most concerns American voters this election year, as always.\n\nBill Whitaker: There are lots of signs that the American economy is doing very well, better than most countries, I think. But the American people don't seem to be feeling it. Groceries are 25% higher and people are blaming you and Joe Biden for that. Are they wrong?\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: We now have historic low unemployment in America among all groups of people. We now have an economy that is thriving by all macroeconomic measures. And, to your point, prices are still too high. And I know that, and we need to deal with it, which is why part of my plan\u2014you mentioned groceries. Part of my plan is what we must do to bring down the price of groceries.\n\nBill Whitaker and Vice President Kamala Harris 60 Minutes\n\nHarris says she'll press Congress to pass a federal ban on price gouging for food and groceries, but details are yet to be defined.\n\nBill Whitaker: You want to expand\u2013 the child tax credit.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: Yes, I do.\n\nBill Whitaker: You want to give tax breaks to first-time home buyers.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: Yes.\n\nBill Whitaker: And people starting small businesses.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: Correct.\n\nBill Whitaker: But it is estimated by the Nonpartisan Committee for Responsible Federal Budget that your economic plan would add $3 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade. How are you gonna pay for that?\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: OK, so the other econ- economists that have reviewed my plan versus my opponent and determined that my economic plan would strengthen America's economy. His would weaken it.\n\nBill Whitaker: But--\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: My plan, Bill, if you don't mind, my plan is about saying that when you invest in small businesses, you invest in the middle class, and you strengthen America's economy. Small businesses are part of the backbone of America's economy.\n\nBill Whitaker: But\u2014but pardon me, Madame Vice President, I-- the-- the question was, how are you going to pay for it?\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: Well, one of the things is I'm gonna make sure that the richest among us, who can afford it, pay their fair share in taxes. It is not right that teachers and nurses and firefighters are paying a har-- a higher tax rate than billionaires and the biggest corporations.\n\nBill Whitaker: But\u2014but\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: And I plan on making that fair.\n\nBill Whitaker: But we're dealing with the real world here.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: But the real world includes\u2014\n\nBill Whitaker: How are you gonna get this through Congress?\n\nVice President Kamala Harris 60 Minutes\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: You know, when you talk quietly with a lot of folks in Congress, they know exactly what I'm talking about, 'cause their constituents know exactly what I'm talking about. Their constituents are those firefighters and teachers and nurses. Their constituents are middle-class, hard-working folk.\n\nBill Whitaker: And Congress has shown no inclination to move in your direction.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: I-- I disagree with you. There are plenty of leaders in Congress who understand and know that the Trump tax cuts blew up our federal deficit. None of us, and certainly I cannot afford to be myopic in terms of how I think about strengthening America's economy. Lemme tell you something. I am a devout public servant. You know that. I am also a capitalist. And I know the limitations of government.\n\nKamala Harris has been in government for decades; she was first elected San Francisco district attorney in 2003, then California attorney general, she went on to the U.S. Senate, and now vice president.\n\nBill Whitaker: A quarter of registered voters still say they don't know you. They don't know what makes you tick. And-- and why do you think that is? What\u2013what's the disconnect?\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: It's an election, Bill. And I take-- it seriously that I have to earn everyone's vote. This is an election for president of the United States. No one should be able to take for granted that they can just declare themselves a candidate and automatically receive support. You have to earn it. And that's what I intend to do.\n\nBill Whitaker: Lemme tell you what your critics and the columnists say.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: OK.\n\nBill Whitaker: They say that the reason so many voters don't know you is that you have changed your position on so many things. You were against fracking, now you're for it. You supported looser immigration policies, now you're tightening them up. You were for Medicare for all, now you're not. So many that people don't truly know what you believe or what you stand for. And I know you've heard that.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: In the last four years I have been vice president of the United States. And I have been traveling our country. And I have been listening to folks and seeking what is possible in terms of common ground. I believe in building consensus. We are a diverse people. Geographically, regionally, in terms of where we are in our backgrounds. And what the American people do want is that we have leaders who can build consensus. Where we can figure out compromise and understand it's not a bad thing, as long as you don't compromise your values, to find common-sense solutions. And that has been my approach.\n\nBut one issue that has proven impervious to compromise is immigration. Over the past four years, the Biden/Harris approach has been inconsistent, and Republicans are convinced immigration is the vice president's achilles heel.\n\nBill Whitaker: You recently visited the southern border and-- embraced President Biden's recent crackdown on asylum seekers. And that crackdown produced an almost immediate and dramatic decrease in the number of border crossings. If that's the right answer now, why didn't your administration take those steps in 2021?\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: The first bill we proposed to Congress was to fix our broken immigration system, knowing that if you want to actually fix it, we need Congress to act. It was not taken up. Fast forward to a moment when a bipartisan group of members of the United States Senate, including one of the most conservative members of the United States Senate, got together, came up with the border security bill. Well, guess what happened? Donald Trump got word that this bill was afoot and could be passed and he wants to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem, so he told his buddies in Congress, \"Kill the bill. Don't let it move forward.\"\n\nBill Whitaker: But I've been covering the border for-- for years. And so I know this is not a problem that started with your administration.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: Correct. Correct.\n\nBill Whitaker: But there was an historic flood of undocumented immigrants coming across the border the first three years of your administration. As a matter of fact, arrivals quadrupled from the last year of President Trump. Was it a mistake to loosen the immigration policies as much as you did?\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: It's a longstanding problem. And solutions are at hand. And from day one, literally, we have been offering solutions.\n\nBill Whitaker and Vice President Kamala Harris 60 Minutes\n\nBill Whitaker: What I was asking was, was it a mistake to kind of allow that flood to happen in the first place?\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: I think-- the policies that we have been proposing are about fixing a problem, not promoting a problem, okay? But the--\n\nBill Whitaker: But the numbers did quadruple under your--\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: And the numbers today--\n\nBill Whitaker: --under your watch--\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: --because of what we have done-- we have cut the flow of illegal immigration by half. We have cut the--\n\nBill Whitaker: But should you have done that--\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: --flow of fentanyl--\n\nBill Whitaker: --should you have done that--\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: --by half. But we need Congress to be able to act to actually fix the problem.\n\nBill Whitaker: You have accused Donald Trump of using racist tropes when it comes to Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, when it comes to birtherism, when it comes to Charlottesville. In fact, you have called him a racist and divisive. Yet Donald Trump has the support of millions and millions of Americans. How do you explain that?\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: I am glad you're pointing these comments out that he has made, that have resulted in a response by most reasonable people to say, \"It's just wrong. It's just wrong.\"\n\nBill Whitaker: With so many people supporting Donald Trump, a man you have called a racist. How do you bridge that seemingly unbridgeable gap?\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: I believe that the people of America want a leader who's not tryin' to divide us and demean. I believe that the American people recognize that the true measure of the strength of a leader is not based on who you beat down, it's based on who you lift up.\n\nThe Harris campaign has been hopscotching the country and with less than a month to go, the pace is picking up. The vice president told us, she's lost track of how many states she's visited.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: How are you doing?\n\nBill Whitaker: I'm doing well.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: You well?\n\nWe joined her on the trail late last week, in the crucial swing state of Wisconsin, in the town of Ripon, the birthplace in 1854 of the Republican Party.\n\nAnd at a rally plastered with \"country over party\" banners, Harris appeared with staunch conservative Liz Cheney. As vice chair of the House January 6th Committee, Cheney became one of Donald Trump's fiercest critics.\n\nLiz Cheney: I have never voted for a Democrat, but this year, I am proudly casting my vote for Vice President Kamala Harris (applause)\n\nThat proclamation spurred a chant of approval from the crowd\u2026\n\nBill Whitaker: Four years ago if someone had told you that you would be campaigning with Liz Cheney, what would you have said to them?\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: That'd be great. (laughter)\n\nLiz Cheney: She's really diplomatic. (laughter)\n\nBill Whitaker: Would you ever have thought that you'd be campaigning with Kamala Harris?\n\nLiz Cheney: I hope that if you had said to me four years ago, \"Our constitution is going to be under threat and it's gonna be crucial for the parties to come together-- and to support Vice President Harris because she'll defend the rule of law\"-- I know I would've said, \"That's exactly what I'll do.\"\n\nWhoever wins the presidency will take on a host of daunting challenges, especially beyond our borders. Back in Washington, Vice President Harris told us she's determined the U.S must win the economic competition with China for the 21st century. And as for the war between Russia and Ukraine?\n\nBill Whitaker: What does success look like in ending the war in Ukraine?\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: There will be no success in ending that war without Ukraine and the UN charter participating in what that success looks like.\n\nBill Whitaker: Would you meet with President Vladimir Putin to negotiate a solution to the war in Ukraine?\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: Not bilaterally without Ukraine, no. Ukraine must have a say in the future of Ukraine.\n\nBill Whitaker: As president, would you support the effort to expand NATO to include Ukraine?\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: Those are all issues that we will deal with if and when it arrives at that point. Right now, we are supporting Ukraine's ability to defend itself against Russia's unprovoked aggression. Donald Trump, if he were president, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now. He talks about, \"Oh, he can end it on day one.\" You know what that is? It's about surrender.\n\nBill Whitaker: A hard left turn here. But-- you recently surprised people when you said that you are a gun owner and that if someone came into your house--\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: That was not the first time I've-- I've--\n\nBill Whitaker: --they would get shot.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: --talked about it. That's not the first time I've talked about it.\n\nBill Whitaker: So what kind of gun do you own, and when and why did you get it?\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: I have a Glock, and-- I've had it for quite some time. And-- I mean, look, Bill, my background is in law enforcement. And-- so there you go.\n\nBill Whitaker: Have you-- ever fired it?\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: Yes. (laugh) Of course I have. At a shooting range. Yes, of course I have.\n\nDemocratic vice-presidential candidate Tim Walz was little-known outside Minnesota just two months ago. He didn't exactly come from nowhere. He was a six-term congressman and now is governor of Minnesota, where he has championed abortion rights, gun control, and other progressive ideas. But it was calling former President Trump and Sen. JD Vance \"weird\" that may have landed him on the ticket.\n\n60 Minutes\n\nBill Whitaker: Two months ago, you and Kamala Harris barely knew each other. Now, you're running together, vying for the top offices in the land. It's not possible that you agree on everything.\n\nGov. Tim Walz: Yeah.\n\nBill Whitaker: What have been some disagreements you've had since you became a team?\n\nGov. Tim Walz: Well\u2014I\u2014she'd probably disagreed with\u2014she said, \"Tim, you know, you need to be a little more careful on how you say (laugh) things,\" whatever it might be.\n\nWhatever it might be, Walz has been criticized for embellishing or telling outright falsehoods about his military record, and about his travels to Asia in the 1980s.\n\nBill Whitaker: In your debate with JD Vance, you said, \"I'm a knucklehead (laugh) at times.\" And I think you were referring to the time that you said that you were in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square unrest when you were not.\n\nGov. Tim Walz: Yeah.\n\nBill Whitaker: Is that kind of misrepresentation, isn't that more than just being a knucklehead?\n\nGov. Tim Walz: I think folks know who I am. And I think they know the difference between someone expressing emotion, telling a story, getting a date wrong by--you--rather than a pathological liar like Donald Trump.\n\nBill Whitaker: But I think it comes down to the question of whether\u2014whether you can be trusted to tell the truth.\n\nGov. Tim Walz: Yeah. Well-- I can-- I think I can. I will own up to being a knucklehead at times, but the folks closest to me know that I keep my word.\n\nWalz proudly touts his record as governor of Minnesota, but it also has opened him up to criticism from his Republican opponents.\n\nBill Whitaker: Former President Trump says that you and your administration here in Minnesota has been dangerously liberal. Radical left, he calls it. So, what do you say to that criticism, that rather than leading the way, you and Minnesota are actually out of step with the rest of the country?\n\nGov. Tim Walz: President Trump may be referring to that \u2013 that our children get breakfast and lunch in school so that they can learn. He may be talkin' about we have a paid family medical leave policy that was promoted by the business community. Donald Trump spends his time tearing down states rather than lifting up the things we do, the best of it. Donald Trump's critiques of that, not only are they wrong, but I'm waiting for, \"What\u2014what is his solution? Here in Minnesota, we're so optimistic, we walk on water half the year (laugh).\n\nIt was that kind of humor and candor that helped land Tim Walz the job as Kamala Harris's running mate.\n\nBill Whitaker: Before you joined the\u2013 ticket, you called Republicans \"weird.\" And that's sort of become a rallying cry for Democrats. Why do you think that label stuck?\n\nGov. Tim Walz: I was really talking about the behaviors. Being obsessed with people's personal lives in their bedrooms and their reproductive rights, making up stories about legal \u2013folks legally here eating cats and dogs, they're dehumanizing. They go beyond weird because I said this: it becomes almost dangerous. Let's debate policy in a real way and let's try and find an objective truth again.\n\nKamala Harris and Tim Walz are in a full sprint to November 5th, hoping their arguments will give them a chance to cross the line ahead of Donald Trump and JD Vance.\n\nBill Whitaker: You are sitting here with us. The Trump campaign canceled an interview that they had agreed to, to participate in this broadcast. What do you make of that?\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: If he is not gonna give your viewers the ability to have a meaningful, thoughtful conversation, question and answer with you, then watch his rallies. You're gonna hear conversations that are about himself and all of his personal grievances. And what you will not hear is anything about you, the listener. You will not hear about how he is gonna try to bring the country together, find common ground. And, Bill, that is why I believe in my soul and heart, the American people are ready to turn the page.\n\nProduced by Marc Lieberman and Rome Hartman.

        "text": "Election 2024: What\u2019s at Stake for Public Health?\nImpacts to Health Insurance Access\n\nHealth insurance in the U.S. is complicated, but the underlying concept, says Anderson, is that \u201cwe're all in it together and we all take care of each other.\u201d That is what the Affordable Care Act has aimed to achieve, particularly through its inclusion of people with pre-existing conditions.\n\n\u201cHarris is very supportive of all of the help that the ACA has done,\u201d says Anderson, who expects she would maintain and build on its success. \u201cIf you have chronic conditions and you are sick, the options that the Harris administration effectively gives you will protect you from high costs [and] protect you from losing your coverage,\u201d he says.\n\nTrump has not yet articulated a plan for replacing the ACA, Anderson says, \u201cbut he seems to be saying he wants the healthy people to have another option, which is a lower cost option that they can benefit from, that the people with chronic conditions and severe illnesses will have trouble accessing.\u201d\n\nPotential Impacts to Drug Pricing\n\nThe Biden-Harris administration made some major changes to drug costs through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. They have negotiated lower prices on ten drugs that make up nearly 20% of Medicare Part D spending, with plans to add more drugs to that list in the years ahead.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump proposed a similar plan that never got enacted: A negotiation of prices of physician-administered drugs through Medicare Part B \"that would reduce the prices for most of these Part B drugs by 50%, 100%, even 200%, depending on the drug,\" Anderson says, noting that it\u2019s unclear whether Trump would try this tactic again. \u201cIt would reduce prices to international standards, but it's vehemently opposed by the pharmaceutical industry, which is a major supporter of former President Trump.\u201d\n\n\"The whole concept of health insurance ... is we're all in it together and we all take care of each other.\"\n\nThe Future of Medicaid Expansion and Medicare Plans\n\nThe ACA included expanding Medicaid to cover people with household incomes under a certain level. Using federal incentives that covered 90% of the cost, 40 states and Washington D.C. have expanded access so far. Harris is in favor of retaining Medicaid expansion and Anderson expects that she\u2019ll provide additional financial incentives for the 10 states that have not yet adopted the expansion.\n\nA Trump administration could undo the Medicaid expansion or reduce participation in it. If the federal government under Trump reduced how much of the costs they cover, some states could decide to drop out of the expansion causing people to lose their coverage. There\u2019s also been discussion for a second Trump term of states imposing work requirements for people to receive Medicaid benefits, making it harder for people to get coverage.\n\nAs for Medicare, both Trump and Harris have said they want to maintain eligibility and coverage, according to Anderson. \u201cThe big debate will be on Medicare Advantage,\u201d he says, referencing the Medicare health plans offered by private companies that are used by more than half of Medicare beneficiaries.\n\n\u201c[The] Trump administration wants to make everybody [move to]private sector plans and take away what's called \u2018traditional Medicare,\u2019 or to reduce the number of people [using] that option,\u201d Anderson says. He expects a Trump administration would try to make it easier and more appealing to use Medicare Advantage, while making it more difficult to access traditional Medicare.",

        "text": "Importance of Voting in 2024: Why It Should Top Your College To-Do List\nI. Why is Your Vote Important?\n\nIt\u2019s easy to feel like your vote doesn\u2019t matter. But here\u2019s the truth: even a few votes can decide elections, especially at the local level.\n\nBrian Browne, Associate Vice President of University Communications and Public Affairs and Adjunct Professor in the Department of Government and Politics, emphasizes, \u201cFifty-three years ago, the 26th Amendment lowered the voting age from 21 to 18, granting young voters a critical voice in shaping our nation\u2019s future.\"\n\nYoung voters compose nearly one-fifth of the electorate. With 16 million Americans having their first opportunity to vote in the next presidential election, the potential for young people to influence key races is significant.\n\nMr. Browne points out that, \u201cIn addition to the presidential race, with 33 US Senate seats and all 435 US House of Representatives seats up for election in 2024, young voters have the power to sway the results.\u201d\n\nThe Impact of Voting on Student Life\n\nMany young voters feel disconnected from politics\u201457 percent of those aged 18\u201324 are dissatisfied with American democracy, and 33 percent don\u2019t plan to vote in the next presidential election. But did you know your vote directly impacts policies that affect your life as a student\u2014like education, housing, job opportunities, and public transportation?\n\nFor example, political leaders elected to office shape college tuition costs and funding for higher education. Policies around minimum wage, job creation, and affordable housing often hinge on local and national election results. According to the Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement, approximately 50 percent of people aged 18\u201329 and 66 percent of college students voted in the 2020 presidential election. These numbers reflect the growing importance of young voters in deciding the nation\u2019s future.\n\nYet, enthusiasm for voting among young people is waning. As Mr. Browne notes, \u201cRecent polls have identified an enthusiasm gap among young voters entering the 2024 elections, with fewer expected to cast votes compared to 2020.\u201d\n\nThis is where education becomes critical. He stresses, \u201cWhen young people are encouraged to vote and taught how to register in school, it has a compounding effect.\u201d Voting is habit-forming, and starting early can set a lifelong pattern of civic engagement.",

        "text": "2024 United States presidential debates\nPart of the 2024 U.S. presidential election\n\nThe 2024 United States presidential debates were a series of debates held during the 2024 presidential election.\n\nThree debates in total were held during the election season. The first general election debate between the major candidates was sponsored by CNN and attended by then-presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden and presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump on June 27, 2024. Biden was widely considered to have performed poorly during the first debate, with many commentators and Democrats calling for him to drop out of the race. He withdrew his bid for re-election on July 21. A second debate, sponsored by ABC, was held on September 10 between Trump and Kamala Harris; it was widely reported that Harris won. A vice presidential debate, which was sponsored by CBS, was held on October 1.\n\nFour general election debates sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) were originally scheduled to be held between September 16 and October 9, 2024. Both Biden and Trump opposed the CPD's debate format and schedule.[1][2] In May 2024, both campaigns agreed to bypass the CPD and hold the alternative debates, canceling the CPD debates.\n\nBackground [ edit ]\n\nCommission on Presidential Debates [ edit ]\n\nIn April 2022, the Republican National Committee (RNC) voted unanimously to withdraw from the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD); committee chair Ronna McDaniel called the organization \"biased\" and stated that they would find \"newer, better debate platforms\" for future Republican nominees.[3] This announcement came after years of tension between the organizations, including a threat made earlier in the year by the RNC to change its rules to prohibit nominees from participating in CPD debates. In response, the commission stated that \"[its] plans for 2024 will be based on fairness, neutrality and a firm commitment to help the American public learn about the candidates and the issues\".[4]\n\nFormer president Donald Trump, the frontrunner for the Republican nomination, did not attend any primary debates, describing them as unnecessary to his campaign and claiming unfair treatment by organizers.[5] He has previously accused the CPD of unfair treatment in the 2016 and 2020 debates. Despite this, Trump told Fox News host Bret Baier in a June 2023 interview that he was interested in debating incumbent president Joe Biden should he become the Democratic nominee. At that time, Biden had not committed to attending the debate either, as his campaign was also in conflict with the commission for failing to enforce its rules against Trump,[6] though in April 2024 he confirmed he planned to debate Trump.[7]\n\nBiden and Trump became the presumptive nominees of their respective parties in March 2024,[8][2] setting up the first presidential rematch since 1956.[9] On April 14, 2024, a number of major news organizations signed an open letter to the presumptive nominees urging them to attend the debates, arguing for its \"rich tradition in our American democracy\" and that the \"exceptionally high\" stakes require debates to be held. Signatories include ABC News, CBS News, CNN, NBC News, and Fox News, among others.[10]\n\nIf either major party nominee chooses not to attend a general election debate, it would be the second consecutive time its happened, the first being the 2020 debates, when President Trump refused to attend the second debate with Biden because it would have been virtual rather than in person following Trump's COVID-19 diagnosis.[11] It previously occurred in 1980, when President Jimmy Carter refused to attend the first debate with Ronald Reagan due to the presence of independent candidate John B. Anderson.\n\nChris LaCivita and Susie Wiles, campaign managers for Trump, had pushed for more debates to be held by the CPD, in addition to holding them earlier than the planned September date, though the commission refused to accede.[12] Throughout his 2024 campaign, Trump confirmed his intention to cooperate with the CPD repeatedly and challenged Biden to debate \"anywhere, anytime, anyplace\".[13]\n\nThe CPD announced the schedule for its four debates on November 20, 2023. All debates would have started at 9 p.m. ET and would have run for 90 minutes uninterrupted.[14] In order to qualify for the CPD-sponsored debates, presidential candidates would have needed to meet the following criteria: (vice presidential candidates would have qualified by being the running mate of a qualifying presidential candidate)[14]\n\nBe constitutionally eligible to hold the presidency.\n\nAppear on a sufficient number of ballots to have a mathematical possibility of winning a majority vote in the Electoral College.\n\nHave a level of support of at least 15% of the national electorate as determined by five national public opinion polling organizations selected by the commission, using the average of those organizations' most recently reported results at the time of determination.\n\nOn June 24, 2024, the CPD announced that it was releasing the sites it had selected for its 2024 debates from their contracts, adding that \"CPD stands ready to sponsor 2024 debates should circumstances change.\"[15]\n\nBiden\u2013Trump alternative debates [ edit ]\n\nOn May 15, 2024, the Biden campaign announced that it would not participate in the CPD-hosted debates and instead invited Trump to participate in two alternative debates to take place in June and September, each hosted in a TV news studio without an audience.[16][17] Jen O'Malley Dillon, the Biden campaign manager, laid out three reasons for sidelining the CPD, indicating that the debates were not completed until early voting started, that the debates had become \"a spectacle\" and that the CPD could not \"enforce its own rules\".[18] Frank Fahrenkopf, the head of the CPD, pushed back against the claims in an interview with Politico, indicating that the September 16 debate date was the best date, as the \"key date\" to secure ballot access for independents is September 6. Fahrenkopf also noted that the general election debates are \"not like the primary debates\" and that Trump himself had not followed the debate rules during the 2020 general election debate moderated by Chris Wallace.[19] Biden and Trump accepted an offer from CNN to hold the first of these debates on June 27 and from ABC to hold the second on September 10.[20]\n\nTrump indicated the same day that he had accepted a Fox News debate to be hosted on October 2, 2024, though the Biden campaign dismissed the prospect of a third debate.[21] Robert F. Kennedy Jr. accused the two candidates of colluding to exclude him from televised debates \"because they are afraid I would win\"; both CNN and ABC had decided on eligibility criteria that were similar to those that had been used by the CPD, with Kennedy not appearing on a sufficient number of state ballots at that time.[22] The Biden campaign had unsuccessfully proposed that third-party candidates be excluded from the debates.[20] A May poll taken by the Harvard Center for American Political Studies/Harris indicated that 71% of the people surveyed were in favor of allowing a third-party candidate to debate.[23] Kennedy's campaign filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission, maintaining that neither Biden nor Trump meet the ballot access threshold as they have not been nominated by their parties.[24]\n\nTrump announced on May 17 that he would be willing to hold another debate with Biden that would be hosted by NBC News and Telemundo.[25]\n\nOn July 9, Trump challenged Biden to a debate with no moderators that would be done that week, as well as an 18-hole golf match.[26]\n\nDebate list [ edit ]\n\nJune 27: First presidential debate (CNN, Atlanta) [ edit ]\n\nThe first presidential debate, which was the only one in which Biden participated before he dropped out, was held on Thursday, June 27, 2024, at 9:00 p.m. EDT in CNN's studios at the Techwood Turner campus in Atlanta, Georgia.[34]\n\nAmerican writer and political consultant Tim Miller called Biden's performance the \"worst performance in the history of televised presidential debates\",[35] a sentiment also shared by Jeff Greenfield of Politico[36] and NewsNation chief political analyst Chris Stirewalt.[37] Journalist Jake Sherman reported that several congressional Democrats thought that Biden \"didn't even clear the lowest bar\", and that Biden was not even able to articulate what his policies are even if they agreed on them.[35] Some Democrats were unsure whether he should continue his campaign and be the Democratic nominee.[38][39] CNN's chief national correspondent John King reported that there was \"a deep, a wide, and a very aggressive panic\" in the Democratic Party that started a few minutes into the debate. During the debate, unnamed elected officials, party strategists, and fundraisers were reported to have discussed replacing Biden as the party's candidate due to fears about him potentially hurting other Democrats' public perceptions, and deciding if prominent Democrats should make a public statement about asking Biden to step down.[40]\n\nDemocratic Party response [ edit ]\n\n\"I know I'm not a young man, to state the obvious. I don't walk as easily as I used to. I don't talk as smoothly as I used to. I don't debate as well as I used to, but I know what I do know: I know how to tell the truth. I know right from wrong. And I know how to do this job, I know how to get things done. And I know what millions of Americans know: When you get knocked down, you get back up.\" \u2014Joe Biden, responding to criticism of his debate performance during a speech in North Carolina the following day (June 28, 2024).[41][42]\n\nPresident Biden stated to reporters at a Waffle House after the debate: \"I think we did well\" and said he did not have any concerns about his performance or calls for him to drop out of the presidential race, stating that it was difficult to debate \"a liar.\"[43] Biden was congratulated by his wife, First Lady Jill Biden, on his performance at a post-debate gathering. She told him on stage that he did \"such a great job. You answered every question.\"[44] Biden's running mate, Vice President Kamala Harris, claimed that while Biden \"started off slow\", he still managed to have a strong finish.[45] Biden-Harris 2024 campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon praised Biden's debate performance, saying that he presented a \"positive and winning vision\" for the future.[46]\n\nCalls for President Biden to drop out [ edit ]\n\nDemocrats such as Julian Castro and Dean Phillips had hurt their careers for publicly saying that Biden was too old before the debate,[47] but immediately following the debate, some in the party began calling for President Biden to drop out of the presidential race. Democratic strategist James Carville and former 2020 Democratic presidential primary candidate Andrew Yang were the first notable Democrats to make those calls.[48][49] On July 2, U.S. Congressman Lloyd Doggett of Texas became the first Democrat in Congress to publicly call for Biden to step aside as the party's nominee.[50] He was joined by various Congressmembers in the following days. On July 7, four more House Democrats called for Biden to exit the race during a private call, including Adam Smith, Jerry Nadler, Mark Takano, and Joe Morelle.[51] Smith went on the record the following day and called for Biden to withdraw.[52]\n\nBiden stated in an ABC News interview with George Stephanopoulos on July 5 that he would not end his candidacy.[53] The president again refused to drop out on July 8. That day Biden appeared on Morning Joe on MSNBC by telephone, advising the \"elites in the party\" against his nomination to \"run against me. Announce for president. Challenge me at the convention\". He sent a letter to Congressional Democrats before Morning Joe explaining his decision, stating that \"The question of how to move forward has been well-aired for over a week now. And it's time for it to end\".[54] In an attempt to show voters and Democratic politicians that he was capable of facing Donald Trump in the 2024 election, he held a solo press conference on July 11, 2024, following the NATO 2024 Washington summit.[55]\n\nBiden suspended his re-election campaign on July 21, 2024, and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris.[56]\n\nSeptember 10: Second presidential debate (ABC, Philadelphia) [ edit ]\n\nThe second presidential debate was held on Tuesday, September 10, 2024, at 9:00 p.m. EDT at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\nPrelude [ edit ]\n\nThe Biden and Trump campaigns had agreed to a September 10 debate hosted by ABC, but after Biden suspended his re-election campaign, it became unclear whether Trump would debate a new rival candidate.[57] In late July, after Harris secured enough support to become the presumptive nominee, Trump said he would debate her repeatedly, though he said he preferred not to do so on ABC.[58] Fox News extended invitations to Harris and Trump for a proposed debate to place on September 17 in Pennsylvania.[59] Harris indicated on July 25 she was willing to debate Trump on ABC.[60] Trump's communications director, Steven Cheung, remarked the same day that the Trump campaign would not commit to any debate until the Democratic Party formally nominated its candidate.[61] On August 2, Trump stated that the planned September 10 debate (hosted by ABC News) would be \"terminated\" since Biden would no longer be a participant and instead he had \"agreed with Fox News\" to a September 4 debate with a live audience,[62] which Harris never accepted.[63] In an August 8 press conference, Trump announced he would rejoin the September 10 debate, though he made it contingent on Harris agreeing to two other proposed debates, stating that if Harris only agrees to the ABC debate, \"I don't know how that's gonna work out. We'd like to do three debates.\"[64][65]\n\nHarris and Trump verbally sparred over attending the debates.[66][67] On August 15, the Harris campaign said a second debate would be contingent on Trump \"actually showing up\" to the September 10 debate.[68] On August 27, Trump recommitted to the September 10 debate.[69]\n\nQualifications [ edit ]\n\nIn order to qualify for the September 10 ABC debate, presidential candidates needed to meet the following criteria:[70]\n\nBe constitutionally eligible to hold the presidency\n\nFile with the Federal Election Commission\n\nAppear on a sufficient number of ballots to have a mathematical possibility of winning a majority vote in the Electoral College\n\nAgree to the rules of the debate\n\nHave a level of support of at least 15% in four national public polls of registered or likely voters selected by ABC, with such polls dating between August 1 and September 3, 2024.\n\nHarris and Trump were invited to the debate in early August.[71]\n\nFive polls met ABC's criteria for inclusion, with Harris and Trump meeting the 15% threshold in every poll. Kennedy peaked at 6% in a Fox News poll. West, Stein, and Oliver all peaked at 1% support, and no other candidate was tested.[72]\n\nPreparations [ edit ]\n\nHarris prepared for the debate in Pittsburgh. Karen Dunn and Rohini Kosoglu were in charge of the preparations and Philippe Reines played Trump.[74]\n\nTrump prepared for the debate with a small team of advisers, including Matt Gaetz and Tulsi Gabbard.[75]\n\nFormat [ edit ]\n\nThe debate was hosted on ABC, ABC News Live,[76] Disney+ and Hulu, and was simulcast on CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, NBC News and other networks.[77]\n\nThe debate rules remained the same as the one prior, with no audience being present and muted microphones.[78]\n\nDebate [ edit ]\n\nAt the start of the debate, Trump moved behind his lectern, but Harris approached him and extended her hand. It was the first presidential debate to begin with a handshake in eight years.[79]\n\nExternal videos Cat-eating remarks during September 10, 2024, debate\n\nIn the hours leading up to the debate, social media was flooded with reports of baseless allegations\u2014echoed by JD Vance, Trump's running mate, and Trump himself[80]\u2014that Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, were stealing and eating cats and dogs. Despite city officials stating there were no credible reports to substantiate these claims, Trump raised the issue during the debate. He said: \"In Springfield, they're eating the dogs. The people that came in, they're eating the cats. They're eating\u2014they're eating the pets of the people that live there.\" He cited nothing but claimed he heard it on television.[81] Harris laughed as Trump made those statements.[82]\n\nHarris accused Trump of repeatedly exploiting the issue of race to \"divide the American people\". The remark came after a question from the moderators about a July remark in which he said Harris \"became a Black person\".[83]\n\nTrump argued that the Biden administration had \"destroyed\" the country, and falsely labelled Harris a Marxist[84] and tried to portray Harris as a \"radical liberal\". He claimed: \"She has a plan to defund the police. She has a plan to confiscate everyone's guns.\" Harris responded, stating: \"Tim Walz and I are both gun owners. We're not taking anybody's guns away.\"[85] Trump remarked, \"Remember this, she is Biden.\" Harris responded: \"Clearly, I am not Joe Biden.\"[86]\n\nTrump attacked Harris on inflation during his statement on the economy and said \"Look, we've had a terrible economy because inflation has -- which is really known as a country buster. It breaks up countries. We have inflation like very few people have ever seen before. Probably the worst in our nation's history. We were at 21%. But that's being generous because many things are 50, 60, 70, and 80% higher than they were just a few years ago.\" Trump also attacked Harris on immigration saying \"we have millions of people pouring into our country from prisons and jails, from mental institutions and insane asylums. And they're coming in and they're taking jobs that are occupied right now by African Americans and Hispanics and also unions.\"[87]\n\nHarris invited people to attend a Trump rally and observe the crowd. \"People start leaving his rallies early out of exhaustion and boredom,\" she said. Trump responded by saying: \"People don't go to her rallies. There's no reason to go. And the people that do go, she's busing them in and paying them to be there.\"[88]\n\nSome of Harris's sharpest criticisms of Trump occurred during their clash over abortion rights, a key issue for Democrats since the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 with Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization. Harris said: \"One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government\u2014and Donald Trump, certainly\u2014should not be telling a woman what to do with her body.\" She said she would restore women's rights to what they were under Roe, and Trump responded that she would not have the votes necessary in Congress. Trump supported the Dobbs decision to have each state decide whether to ban abortion, but did not answer whether he would veto a hypothetical bill to ban abortion nationwide.[89]\n\nTrump claimed that Harris supported \"defunding the police\", prompting Harris to interject with \"That's not true\" into her muted mic. In response to this perceived interruption, Trump lashed out at Harris with the line \"I'm talking now (...) Does that sound familiar?\", a reference to Harris's notable \"I'm speaking\" line from the 2020 vice presidential debate with Mike Pence.[90]\n\nTrump heavily criticized the Affordable Care Act, though he claimed to have \"saved\" it.[91] When asked if he had a plan of how to replace the act, Trump claimed he had \"concepts of a plan\".[92] \"Concepts of a plan\" ended up being one of the more frequently-quoted lines in the debate's aftermath.\n\nWhen moderators questioned him about any regrets regarding the January 6 Capitol attack, he denied responsibility and redirected the conversation to Black Lives Matter protests. He blamed then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi for not accepting his alleged offer of sending the National Guard, which the Speaker does not control.[93] He initially used \"we\" when referring to the January 6 protestors and then pivoted, saying: \"This group of people that has been treated so bad.\"[94]\n\nTrump was repeatedly asked if he wanted Ukraine to win its war against Russia and if it was in the best interests of the U.S. for Kyiv to achieve victory. He did not address the question directly, stating instead that he wants the war to end in order to save lives. Harris told Trump, \"[Putin] would eat you for lunch\" and claimed that if he had been president when Russia invaded Ukraine, \"Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now.\" She alleged that Trump's claim that the war would be over in 24 hours was based on the idea that he would simply concede to Putin.[95]\n\nThe moderators were tasked with fact-checking the candidates during the debate, and multiple news outlets did so as well.[96][97][98] CNN found that Trump made over 30 false claims during the debate, and Harris only made one, along with several statements \"that were misleading or lacking in key context.\"[99]\n\nWhen Trump repeated the debunked allegation that immigrants in Springfield were eating pets, the moderator David Muir responded that there had been no credible reports of pets being harmed. Trump countered by claiming he had seen TV interviews where people said their dogs had been taken and eaten.[100] Trump claimed that there was virtually no inflation during his presidency. However, inflation rose 6% during his first 42 months in office.[101] Trump claimed that some babies were being subjected to \"executions\" after birth. Davis intervened to fact-check him, stating: \"There is no state in this country where it is legal to kill a baby after it's born.\"[102] Trump also said that \"A lot of these illegal immigrants coming in, [Democrats] are trying to get them to vote\"; however, it is illegal for noncitizens to vote in federal elections.[103]\n\nHarris also made misleading and false claims during the debate, including that Trump \"exchanged love letters\" with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, and that Trump would sign a national ban on abortion. Trump had only said the two leaders had fallen \"in love,\" and he would not answer a question about whether he would veto a national abortion ban.[96] Harris also falsely stated that \"there is not one member of the United States military who is an active duty in a combat zone,\" with the United States military's Central Command shortly thereafter issuing a statement that it had engaged various Houthi targets in Yemen within the past 24 hours.[104]\n\nViewership [ edit ]\n\nNielsen Media Research reported that 67.1 million viewers across ABC and 16 other television networks watched the debate, up from the 51.3 million viewers who watched the June 27 presidential debate between Biden and Trump;[105] an additional seven million viewed through Disney-owned streaming platforms.[106]\n\nReception and aftermath [ edit ]\n\nA Voice of America video covering early reactions to the debate\n\nHarris was declared the winner of the debate by columnists from CNN,[107] Politico,[108] The New York Times,[109] USA Today,[110] Business Insider,[111] Vox,[112] The Guardian,[113] MSNBC,[114] and the Los Angeles Times.[115]\n\nDebate winner Outlet Harris Trump Not sure CNN 63% 37% YouGov 43% 28% 30% Reuters/Ipsos 53% 24% 24%\n\nAccording to a CNN flash poll, 63% of text message respondents believed Harris won the debate, while 37% felt Trump won.[116] A poll from YouGov showed 43% of respondents saying that Harris won, 28% saying that Trump won, and 30% unsure.[117] A poll from Reuters and Ipsos showed 53% of respondents saying that Harris won, as opposed to 24% saying that Trump won.[118]\n\nAccording to Amy Walter, editor of the nonpartisan The Cook Political Report, Harris won the debate by successfully turning it into a referendum on Trump, while Trump did not make a consistent or compelling case against Harris.[119]\n\nMuir and Davis's fact-checking approach to the debate received criticism from Republicans, who alleged they fact-checked and interrupted Trump excessively while not doing the same to Harris.[120][121][122] Trump echoed those complaints and suggested ABC News should lose its license.[123] Other journalists and Republican pollster Frank Luntz praised their moderation.[121]\n\nTrump received criticism from conservative commentators and lawmakers for what was described as \"taking the bait\" on comments Harris made regarding crowds at his rallies.[124] Trump's campaign strategists had urged him to emphasize in the debates that he was a \"changed man\" who had survived an assassination attempt and would unite America, but they believed he had been unable to do so.[125]\n\nMany of Trump's statements during the debate, such as \"They're eating the dogs ... they're eating the cats ... they're eating the pets\", \"execution after birth\", \"transgender operations on illegal aliens in prison\", \"Abdul ... the head of the Taliban\", and \"I have concepts of a plan\" became viral Internet memes in its aftermath, as did Harris's facial expressions in response to Trump's statements.[d]\n\nAt one point, while criticizing Trump over inviting the Taliban to Camp David and the deal that would eventually lead to the Afghan withdrawal, Harris referred to Trump as \"this former president\", pausing between \"this\" and \"former president\". In media coverage of the debate, some commentators drew attention to the pause, suggesting that Harris was avoiding using an insult or an expletive.[132][133][134]\n\nAfter the debate, polls showed Harris still had a hard time conveying the perception that she would represent a \"change\" in policy, due to her being a part of the Biden administration.[135][136]\n\nOctober 1: Vice presidential debate (CBS, New York City) [ edit ]\n\nThe vice presidential debate was held on Tuesday, October 1, 2024, at 9:00 p.m. EDT at the CBS Broadcast Center in New York City.[138]\n\nPrelude [ edit ]\n\nAfter Biden's withdrawal on July 21, 2024, doubt was cast over the vice presidential debate, as Harris began her own campaign for the presidency.[139] Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance initially expressed annoyance at losing the opportunity to debate Harris,[140] but showed interest in debating Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz. The day after he was selected as the Democratic vice presidential nominee, Walz spoke in favor of debating Vance.[141]\n\nOn August 14, CBS offered four dates for a vice presidential debate: September 17 and 24 and October 1 and 8.[142] Walz was the first to agree to an October 1 debate that same day,[143] with Vance agreeing to the date the following day.[144]\n\nPreparations [ edit ]\n\nRepublican Minnesota Representative Tom Emmer played Walz in Vance's debate prep, while Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg played Vance in Walz's prep.[145]\n\nFormat [ edit ]\n\nThe debate was hosted on CBS and lasted for 90 minutes.[146] Both candidates' microphones were left on while the other candidate spoke,[137] unlike the previous 2024 presidential debates,[147] though CBS had the right to turn off candidate microphones.[137] Neither candidate was allowed to ask the other questions, with only the moderators allowed to do so.[147] At the end of the debate, Walz delivered his closing remarks first, then Vance.[148] Margaret Brennan and Norah O'Donnell were the moderators.[149]\n\nDebate [ edit ]\n\nDuring the debate, both candidates argued for the economic policies of their respective running mates. Walz argued that under the Harris economic proposals, costs for housing and prescription drugs would decrease. Vance said Harris's economic agenda \"sounds pretty good\", but stated she could have implemented it as vice president if she had chosen to, and he blamed her for many of the country's economic challenges, claiming more voters trust Trump on the economy.[150][151]\n\nWhen Walz brought up Amber Thurman, a Georgian woman who died after a delay in getting a procedure to clear fetal tissue from her body after a medical abortion, Vance said: \"I agree with you. Amber Thurman should still be alive.\" Vance also asserted he did not support a national abortion ban, although he had supported a \"minimum national standard\" when he was running for Senate.[150]\n\nReuters reported Vance's statement that the United States is \u201cthe cleanest economy in the entire world\u201d is false.[152] Vance had been responding to a question about climate change, saying he and Trump support \"clean air and water\u201d. He suggested the best response to climate change would be to \"reshore as much American manufacturing as possible and you'd want to produce as much energy as possible\" in the U.S. He also suggested building more nuclear power plants and said Harris has not invested enough in natural gas.[151]\n\nWalz responded by saying \"climate change is real\" and \"reducing our impact is absolutely critical.\" In addition to clean energy and oil production, he said \"we're producing more natural gas than we ever have.\" He then spoke about the need for climate mitigation, which he said the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is helping with.[151]\n\nVance refused to admit that Donald Trump lost the election, stating \"Tim, I'm focused on the future\u201d. Walz's response was \"that's a damning non-answer.\" Vance also downplayed the severity of the January 6 United States Capitol attack and Trump's role in challenging the 2020 election results. Vance asked Walz if he supported social media censorship.[153][154]\n\nVance was asked how the Trump administration would implement its campaign pledge to \"carry out the largest mass deportation plan in American history and to use the U.S. military to do so\" and whether parents who have entered the country illegally would be deported and separated from children born on U.S. soil. Vance responded that he would start with \"about a million\" immigrants who have committed crimes besides entering the country illegally and complained about \"Kamala Harris's wide open southern border.\"[151]\n\nWalz responded by touting Harris's record as California attorney general prosecuting human trafficking and said Trump did not deliver on his 2016 campaign promise to build a border wall and get Mexico to pay for it. He also complained that Trump got the bipartisan Secure the Border Act scuttled in 2023, which would have funded additional border agents, drug detection, and faster adjudication.[151]\n\nWalz spoke slightly more than Vance during the debate, with CNN reporting that Walz spoke for approximately 40 minutes and 42 seconds, while Vance spoke for 38 minutes and 59 seconds.[155]\n\nCBS stated in late September that the moderators would not fact-check the candidates during the debate, with fact-checking instead handled online and on-air only after the debate.[156] When Vance was fact checked on the status of Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, he objected saying, \"The rules were that you were not going to fact check,\" and argued that the immigrants should not be considered legal because the federal government decided their protected status after they had arrived in the United States.[157] Walz rejected Vance's argument, and the microphones were muted as Vance continued speaking.[149]\n\nViewership [ edit ]\n\nNielsen Media Research reported that 43 million viewers across CBS and 15 other television networks watched the debate, down from 57 million viewers during the 2020 vice presidential debate.[158]\n\nReception [ edit ]\n\nDebate winner Outlet Vance Walz Tie CNN 51% 49% CBS 42% 41% 17% Politico/Focaldata 50% 50%\n\nVance's debate performance was praised by political pundits, and he was declared the winner by columnists from The New York Times,[159] The Wall Street Journal,[160] the Los Angeles Times,[161] USA Today,[162] the Financial Times,[163] and Politico.[164] The columnists from The Washington Post[165] and Reuters[166] commended both Vance and Walz for the high level of civility and focus on policy in the debate.\n\nAccording to a flash poll by CBS News and YouGov, Vance was only slightly ahead with 42 percent of viewers thinking him to be the winner, followed closely by 41 percent believing Walz won it, while 17 percent said the debate was tied.[167][168] The poll also reported that 88 percent of viewers found the tone of the debate was \u201cgenerally positive\u201d.[168][169]\n\nThe New York Times wrote that Vance delivered \"one of the best debating performances by a Republican nominee for president or vice president in recent memory\", making a strong case for Trump's record while also emphasizing his own personal biography, after facing weeks of attacks from the Democrats.[159] Politico noted that Vance offered an effective critique of Biden-Harris administration, while managing to move past his controversial past statements about women and immigrants.[164] However, he did face criticism for not acknowledging Trump's loss of the 2020 election.[164]\n\nThe VP debate was broadly considered a polite and policy-focused event, in which Vance and Walz agreed with each other a lot; after the debate, they chatted and introduced their wives to each other.[170] Vance also used the debate platform to remind viewers about his middle-class background and that he went to college with the help of the G.I. Bill after serving in Iraq.[171]\n\nOther proposed debates [ edit ]\n\nProposed RFK Jr. vs Trump debate [ edit ]\n\nOn May 7, 2024, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. issued an open letter challenging former President Trump to debate him at the Libertarian National Convention, where both were already scheduled to speak from May 24\u201325, citing Trump's frequent and vocal claims that he would be willing to debate anywhere and Kennedy's own competitive polling with both major candidates. Trump did not respond to this challenge.[172]\n\nProposed Harris\u2013Vance debate [ edit ]\n\nA vice presidential debate in July was initially proposed, which would have taken place after the selection of a vice presidential candidate at the 2024 Republican National Convention.[27] The Biden campaign agreed to a vice presidential debate hosted by CBS News to take place on either July 23 or August 13.[173] The Trump campaign confirmed with Politico that it was aware of the offer, but had not yet made a decision.[174] Trump stated on May 17 he agreed to a vice presidential debate on behalf of his future vice presidential pick. Bret Baier of Fox News stated in an interview with Martha MacCallum held on May 17 that Fox would be willing to host a vice presidential debate on July 23, August 13, or \"following both party conventions\".[25]\n\nFollowing the selection of U.S. Senator JD Vance as the Republican vice presidential nominee, vice president Kamala Harris had left Vance a voicemail on July 15 to congratulate him on his nomination. They spoke the following day, though terms for the debate were still under discussion.[175] Vance rejected the call for a vice presidential debate, citing concerns over Biden's status as the presumptive Democratic nominee being in doubt following the first presidential debate.[139]\n\nProposed second Harris\u2013Trump debate [ edit ]\n\nSoon after the September 10 debate, the Harris campaign called for Trump to attend a second debate with Harris, that would be held sometime in October. Initially, Trump was non-committal, saying he would be \"less inclined to\" debate Harris a second time and that Harris only wanted another debate because she lost \"very badly,\" but that he would \"think about it.\"[176] CBS News offered to host a debate to be held at Arizona State University in October.[177] On September 12, Trump announced he would not take part in another debate with Harris.[178] The next day, he said he might be willing to debate if he \"got in the right mood\".[179]\n\nOn September 21, Kamala Harris accepted an invitation from CNN to participate in a debate to be hosted at the CNN Studios in Atlanta on October 23.[180] However, Trump said it was \"just too late,\" as \"voting has already started.\"[181] (Early voting varies by state, with some states mailing ballots earlier than others.)[182] On October 2, a day after the vice presidential debate, Trump said he would not debate Harris again.[183] On October 9, Fox News invited both candidates to participate in a debate to be hosted on either October 24 or October 27. Hours later, Trump reaffirmed in a Truth Social post that he would not debate Harris again.[184]\n\nMinor debates and forums [ edit ]\n\nVarious debates and forums have been held, sponsored by the Free & Equal Elections Foundation.\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nNotes [ edit ]",

        "text": "Take the long view, Hillary Clinton tells students\nHillary Rodham Clinton has spent a lot of time thinking about life\u2019s setbacks as well as its opportunities. She shared some of those reflections \u2013 and the lessons learned from overcoming challenges \u2013 to students in the Continuing Studies course POL 68: Election 2024: Democracy on the Ballot on Oct. 6.\n\n\u201cHave a longer perspective, both on your life and on the history of your country,\u201d Clinton urged. \u201cThere are so many challenges that come up in life that you have to learn to deal with. You have to be resilient.\u201d\n\nThis was Clinton\u2019s third time speaking in the course; her first two visits \u2013 which were in previous years \u2013 were over Zoom. The course, taught by Jim Steyer, an adjunct professor at Stanford Graduate School of Education, features prominent leaders from across the political spectrum, business, foreign policy, academia, and the media. This year, the course focuses on the challenges facing the U.S. ahead of the 2024 election.\n\nSteyer introduced the conversation, titled the \u201cState of American Democracy,\u201d by highlighting Clinton\u2019s five decades of public service, including her roles as a child rights advocate, the first lady of Arkansas and the U.S., U.S. senator, and U.S. secretary of state.\n\n\u201cThink about this, just for a second: She spent over five decades in public service,\u201d Steyer said, prompting applause from the class, which included both Continuing Studies students from the community and Stanford undergraduates and Stanford graduate and professional students.\n\nClinton\u2019s new book, Something Lost, Something Gained: Reflections on Life, Love, and Liberty (Simon & Schuster, 2024), looks back on her distinguished public service career. The title comes from Joni Mitchell\u2019s song \u201cBoth Sides Now.\u201d Clinton recalled first hearing the song in her early 20s but not fully grasping its meaning then. After hearing Mitchell perform it at the Grammy Awards earlier this year \u2013 and pushing through health issues to do so \u2013 Clinton was inspired to reflect on her own life.\n\n\u201cI was motivated to think about my life at this point and to look at life and love from both sides of now and realize how my feelings about it had changed over time,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nSteyer and Clinton went on to discuss some of her early child advocacy work, a cause she shares in common with Steyer, who is the founder and CEO of Common Sense Media, a nonprofit organization that provides families with ratings and reviews of media and technology.\n\nDuring her first year at Yale Law School in the early 1970s, Clinton met Marian Wright Edelman, who helped start the Head Start program and later founded the Children\u2019s Defense Fund.\n\nClinton went on to work with Edelman, interning at the Children\u2019s Defense Fund, where she collected data on children with disabilities.\n\nAt the time, there was no law in the United States that required children with disabilities to get an education. Clinton went door-to-door gathering information about the impact this discrepancy had on families. She saw firsthand how many children were not enrolled in school because of lack of support.\n\n\u201cYou cannot imagine how many children were not in school because the schools would not take them,\u201d Clinton reflected.\n\nThose efforts by the Children\u2019s Defense Fund, along with the work of other advocacy groups and organizations, eventually led to the passing of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) in 1990. Clinton has since spent most of her career ensuring all children get support.\n\nBut it has not always been successful; for example, when working at the Children\u2019s Defense Fund, a bill was passed in Congress for universal child care only to be vetoed by then President Richard Nixon.\n\nClinton also discussed her role in establishing the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) as first lady. Clinton cautioned not to take such protections for granted, citing efforts to overturn the Affordable Care Act and the reversal of Roe v. Wade in the Supreme Court\u2019s 2022 ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t ever think your work is done because there are people who sadly want to undo it,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nParallels\n\nClinton and Steyer also discussed parallels between Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign and that of Kamala Harris, particularly the role the Electoral College plays in determining the outcome of the election.\n\n\u201cThe Electoral College is a particular anachronism because it\u2019s the only device that determines who the winner of an election is based not on who gets the most votes but how they\u2019re apportioned in the states,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nClinton won the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes but lost the Electoral College by 77,000 votes in three states. With only a handful of states deciding the American presidency, Clinton sees this amounting to a constitutional crisis.\n\n\u201cI think we are in a constitutional crisis because it is difficult to hold together a big, pluralistic country like ours when you only have a presidential election in seven or eight states,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nAlso discussed was the rise of social media and the viral spread of conspiracy theories, with Clinton urging students not to take bogus claims lightly, no matter how outrageous a conspiracy may seem.\n\n\u201cI mean, who would believe that I\u2019m running a child trafficking ring in the basement of a pizzeria? Well, guess what \u2013 literally, millions of people. Why? Because it was repeated over and over again through the channels that they tune in to,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nClinton observed that since her 2016 campaign, the technology and capabilities of AI to generate fraudulent images, video, and audio \u2013 known as deepfakes \u2013 has only improved.\n\nClinton also raised her concerns about election interference from foreign actors through the spread of mis- and disinformation online using these newly available tools. Even small margins of voters influenced by fake news could determine election outcomes, she warned.\n\nThe conversation also included Clinton\u2019s assessment of how the Republican Party has evolved under Donald Trump\u2019s ascent into politics, including his interest and praise of global autocrats.\n\nGlobal politics\n\nSteyer also asked for Clinton\u2019s assessment of the intensifying Middle East conflict following the Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Hamas on Israel.\n\nClinton described the conflict as a \u201cstrategic regional challenge,\u201d noting that it extends beyond Israel and Hamas to involve Hezbollah, the Houthis, and Iran.\n\nClinton said she sees an opportunity for Lebanon to reconstitute itself as a state, which has been prevented by Hezbollah \u2013 a point she discussed earlier with Condoleezza Rice, the Tad and Dianne Taube Director of the Hoover Institution and former U.S. secretary of state.\n\nAdvice to students\n\nClinton\u2019s wide-ranging conversation also touched on the glass ceiling \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s real; I wouldn't pretend that it wasn\u2019t,\u201d she said \u2013 and juggling both work and her family \u2013 \u201cit was a constant balancing act.\u201d\n\nSteyer closed by asking Clinton\u2019s advice to students. She urged them to think about their own roles and responsibilities in a democracy beyond voting and to be ready to bounce back from life\u2019s inevitable setbacks.\n\n\u201cYou have to figure out how to pick yourself up and go on. It\u2019s the same for a country, and you can\u2019t \u2013 you shouldn\u2019t, I hope \u2013 give up on yourself. You shouldn\u2019t give up on your country for all of our faults and our problems and our setbacks and our disappointments and even the threats that I see coming from this election. Just don\u2019t give up.\u201d",

        "text": "Hafez Al Mirazi Speaks on the Role of Arab Americans in the 2024 Election\nAs November and the 2024 U.S. presidential election draw closer, Colgate University\u2019s Program in Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies hosted television journalist Hafez Al Mirazi to discuss the Arab-American voter climate. The event was co-sponsored by Asian studies, film and media studies, and Core Communities.\n\nA longtime critic of censorship in journalism, Al Mirazi has more than 40 years of broadcast experience, serving as the BBC Arabic radio correspondent from Washington, D.C., between 1998 and 2000 and the Al Jazeera D.C. bureau chief for the 2000 U.S. election. He taught television journalism at the American University of Cairo and is currently a weekly columnist at the Egyptian news website AlManassa.\n\nA U.S. citizen who was born in Egypt, Al Mirazi is familiar with the difficult decision Arab Americans will face in the poll booths this November. According to Al Mirazi, the political concerns of Arab people have shifted from oil to the conflict between Israel and Palestine, Palestinian autonomy, and Israeli expansionism.\n\nAl Mirazi says that Donald Trump failed in his attempts to cater to a Jewish-American audience, and he has upset many Arab American voters in the process. Al Mirazi estimates that Arab-American support for Trump will be cut in half compared to the last election cycle after Trump said \u201cI want the job finished\u201d in support of Israel\u2019s attack on Palestine.\n\nSimilarly, President Joe Biden faced criticism from Arab Americans, who established an \u201cAbandon Biden\u201d campaign as a result of his approach to the Israel-Palestine conflict. Since Vice President Kamala Harris replaced Biden as the Democratic nominee, Arab-Americans have shown some level of forgiveness toward the party, according to Al Mirazi.\n\nAbove all else, Al Mirazi argues, Arab-Americans wanted a \u201ccommitment from Democrats to a ceasefire now and to stop delivering bombs and weapons to Israel, which they didn\u2019t get.\u201d\n\nMany Arab Americans, Al Mirazi says, are drawn to Green Party candidate Jill Stein, who listed the conflict in Gaza as a paramount issue. Her support of Palestine has earned the respect and support of Arab-American voters, though not enough to outweigh support for Harris.\n\nThe Arab-American voter population is concentrated most densely in swing states like Michigan, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania and therefore has the potential to influence the election\u2019s outcome. The most difficult job, according to Al Mirazi, will be getting Arab-Americans to the polling booths; the demographic had a 54% voter turnout in the 2020 election, compared to the 66% national average.\n\nMeanwhile, in Arab countries, many people follow the U.S. presidential election closely. \u201cPeople deprived of a peaceful transfer of power through elections are keen on watching it,\u201d Al Mirazi says.\n\nThe narrative spun by state-controlled media in many Arab countries poses the close nature of U.S. presidential elections as a promise of impending doom. \u201cUnfortunately, Arab media look at what is going on in Washington and the elections in the U.S. and say, \u2018Look, society is divided: they have a problem. They\u2019re about to have a civil war,\u2019\u201d Al Mirazi says.\n\nFor his part, Al Miraz believes the actual implications of such a tight race are much more optimistic. \u201cYou are sure that four or five years from now, even if you have whatever problem with the guy that the election brought in, you can get rid of that person through the ballots, not the bullets.\u201d",

        "text": "Anticipating the US presidential election\nOne of the most significant \u2018known unknowns\u2019 of 2024 is less than one month away. Indeed, the 47th president of the United States will be \u2013 or at least should be \u2013 elected on 5 November. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are neck and neck in the polls. A few thousand votes in a handful of swing states are likely to decide the leader of the world\u2019s largest economy over the next four years.\n\nThe illusion of predictions\n\nOver the past few months, many pundits have embarked on an elusive \u2014 and largely irrelevant \u2014 attempt to quantify the impact that each presidential candidate would have on domestic growth, inflation, interest rates and financial markets. The reality is that there are too many variables and unknowns to reliably predict what could happen over the next few months.\n\nFirst, the next president\u2019s ability to govern and implement their platform will depend heavily on the shape of the US Congress. A clean sweep would grant them \u2018full power\u2019. However, if this power is split between Republicans and Democrats in the House of Representatives and the Senate, then passing (almost) any new law may be a challenge. The latter is what markets appear to be discounting, for now.\n\nSecond, it\u2019s important to differentiate between what\u2019s being said on the campaign trail and what\u2019s likely to be implemented. For example, during his first presidential campaign, Donald Trump touted the idea of repealing Obamacare. Although few changes were introduced to the Affordable Care Act, it was never repealed. Similarly, candidate Joe Biden suggested in 2020 that when president he would increase the federal tax rate on corporations from 21% to 28%. Again, this hasn\u2019t happened.\n\nFinally, most of these analyses are performed ceteris paribus. In other words, when looking at the possible impact of import tariffs for example, economists tend to assume that apart from the levies themselves, nothing else will happen. This is never the case. In this instance, currencies will move, the countries impacted may retaliate, and companies and consumers will change behaviour and adapt. These second and third derivatives can\u2019t be modelled with any degree of certainty.\n\nThe big picture\n\nAll we can do then is to share some high-level thoughts on the issues at stake. Based on the current narrative from candidates, we see two main macroeconomic themes.\n\nAdditional tariffs, especially if implemented across the board, could promote an inflationary impulse. Its magnitude will be heavily dependent on i) companies\u2019 willingness to absorb some of these higher costs through margins compression, and ii) consumers\u2019 ability to tolerate higher prices. At the extreme, increased tariffs could be deflationary if they lead to a severe economic contraction.\n\nImmigration is another key topic in this election. Overall, both candidates advocate more controlled immigration, with Donald Trump\u2019s proposals being more \u2018extreme\u2019, given that the former president could decide to deport \u201cmillions\u201d of undocumented immigrants, according to some press reports.\n\nIntuitively, lower immigration could tighten the US job market, leading to higher wages and possibly inflation. The reality is, once again, more complex and the ultimate impact would vary significantly depending on which type of workforce is prevented from entering the US.\n\nFiscal versus monetary\n\nMost importantly, these analyses make assumptions about the fiscal and monetary policies that will accompany any measures related to tariffs or immigration. Indeed, both candidates have been relatively quiet about the ballooning US deficit, and none seems to have a clear plan to drastically reduce government debt levels.\n\nMarkets may push yields higher and prevent the next president from implementing any policy that would result in a larger deficit. Similarly, should inflation rise (or maybe collapse), one should expect the US Federal Reserve to act. A change in monetary policy could easily supersede the impact of any political decision.\n\nWithout knowing how these two critical variables would react, estimating the impact of higher tariffs or lower immigration appears futile. Not only that, but for investors what really matters is how markets would react. Here again, it\u2019s nearly impossible to build any conviction. The chart below should serve as a strong reminder that a simple narrative is often a bad investment counsellor.\n\nIndeed, in 2016, the story went that President Donald Trump would be a boon for the US oil industry as he wanted the country to achieve energy independance. Energy was the worst performing S&P 500 sector under his presidency (see chart). Ironically, it was the best performing one under President Biden, who was seen as running a much \u201cgreener\u201d agenda.\n\nS&P 500 sectoral performance through Trump\u2019s and Biden\u2019s tenures\n\nThe performance of the S&P 500 from the date the president was elected until the end of July in their fourth year in power",

It differs from regular stress in the sense that it is specific to that particular time leading up and into November.\u201d While the phrase \u201celection stress\u201d is typically associated with the U.S. presidential election, it can be applied to any election at any level.\n\nZoe Stuckey, a psychotherapist at Pasadena Villa Outpatient in North Carolina, says that clients who are presenting with election stress may appear more irritable, especially during conversations on the topic or may present with more sleep disturbances than usual. \u201cI think a good way to describe it is to compare it to seasonal affective disorder (SAD). Symptoms increase when it\u2019s that time of year and decrease when it isn\u2019t election time,\u201d she says. Whereas SAD traditionally affects people in the fall and winter months, election anxiety may only crop up every four years.\n\nThese worries and negative thoughts appear to be universal \u2014 and more tense \u2014 among Americans. \u201cI\u2019ve observed increased anxiety in clients and in the general population, manifesting in more frequent panic attacks related to political news, heightened family conflicts over political differences and increased feelings of helplessness and fear about the future,\u201d says Kerri Legette McCullough, EdD, LPC, LCPC, LCMHC.\n\nElection Stress in Marginalized Communities\n\nElection stress can have a greater impact on minoritized communities, and those in states where important rights are on the ballot, such as gender-affirming health care, abortion and Medicaid.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a complex landscape for minoritized populations to have to navigate, which certainly exacerbates the stress these folks face,\u201d says Jordan Westcott, PhD, NCC, an assistant professor of counselor education at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.\n\nSome marginalized groups who may be affected by the outcome of the presidency include (but are not limited to):\n\nPeople over the age of 65\n\nPeople who are unhoused\n\nLGBTQIA+ individuals\n\nPeople with disabilities\n\nPeople of color\n\nImmigrants (both those with or without legal status)\n\nThese identities can often overlap, but each one of these groups faces specific challenges that can be exacerbated if a certain candidate wins, Caraballo says.\n\nFor example, many of his clients who are people of color are coming to him with concerns about the increased scrutiny they\u2019re facing in the workplace. This increased judgment is a result of some politicians saying that people of color and other minorities are being hired because of their background as opposed to their abilities.\n\nOlder adults, Westcott notes, are the fastest-growing proportion of people experiencing homelessness. Yet, they are often overlooked for several reasons.\n\n\"I think the broader consciousness kind of assumes older people have more power in this country. They tend to vote more. Congress tends to skew a little bit older, but the average older person doesn\u2019t actually hold very much financial power,\u201d she says. Some Republicans want to cut Social Security, which would increase the risk of older adults becoming homeless.\n\nSetting Healthy Boundaries\n\nWhile it may seem impossible to escape talk of the election and related news, it is possible to set healthy boundaries, Westcott says. Although it can be hard to avoid political topics, especially during an election season, she advises clients to find ways to remove themselves from the situation when it does happen.\n\n\u201cBoundaries are about our behavior and not someone else\u2019s, so a boundary is not \u2018you have to stop doing this.\u2019 A boundary is \u2018this is how I will respond if you continue doing this,\u2019\u201d Westcott says.\n\nFor example, if a client doesn\u2019t want to talk politics on phone calls with a specific relative, they can come up with a script to explain the rules such as, \u201cIf you bring up this topic, I\u2019m going to end the phone call.\u201d\n\nIn situations where people cannot be as open with their boundaries, such as in the workplace, they can give minimal responses and not engage heavily in the conversation.\n\nCaraballo says he often helps clients figure out their boundaries by instructing them to ask themselves questions to figure out their limits. These questions include:\n\nHow will I discuss this political topic?\n\nHow will I not discuss it?\n\nWhat is my time investment in this conversation going to be?\n\nWhat is my time investment with this particular person going to be?\n\nLooking to the Future\n\nWith the election fast approaching, how can counselors help keep their clients\u2019 spirits up and help them cope until Election Day and afterward?\n\nJones focuses on mindfulness for herself and recommends it for her clients; in particular, she has clients plan how they will spend the days leading up to and after the election and figure out what they will do when they learn the results.\n\nFinding something to look forward to can help counselors and clients alike no matter what the election outcome.\n\n\u201cEven if the election doesn\u2019t go our way, we can have a party and gather our friends and neighbors and just have conversations, space for our grievances so we\u2019re not sitting alone with the stress of it,\u201d she says.",

        "text": "Election Implications for Clean Energy, Climate and Critical Mineral Programs at DOE\nAs the Biden Administration moves swiftly to implement the trifecta of legislation it has worked to have enacted in the last three years \u2013 the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) \u2013 the prominent question on everyone's mind is how will the election impact its progress. Although much has been done to advance clean energy projects of all shapes and sizes, considerable work remains to spur the administration's stated goals to institute a comprehensive clean energy transition and regain U.S. energy leadership. The election will impact the pace at which those policies, programs, projects and overall congressional objectives are achieved.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) recently announced that all BIL and IRA funds have been launched, meaning there is a plan in place to issue funding opportunities for all remaining programs and accounts. Most of these funding opportunities were brand new, such as the Hydrogen Hubs and the Transmission Facilitation Program. However, even in those programs that have been competitively reviewed and selections made, there is still significant work to be done to realize the full value of these investments. Regardless of whether Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump is elected in November, there are benefits to be had from the success of these programs, which can drive job creation and continue U.S. innovation that's currently underway.\n\nHarris-Walz Administration\n\nIn a potential Harris-Walz Administration, it is very likely that there would be continued execution of the BIL and IRA endeavors. This includes an even stronger investment in \"community benefits\" plans to support the energy transition. Another major focus would be on capital formation for clean technology through leveraging the federal government to accelerate private-sector investment. DOE recently announced a new initiative, the Manufacturing Capital Connector, intended to connect companies applying to DOE clean energy manufacturing programs to capital providers seeking high-quality projects. Programs such as this would help to bring in resources needed to stretch federal dollars and support the clean energy transition. Additionally, a Harris Administration would continue efforts around workforce development to serve the new industries that are being established, including battery manufacturing, processing and recycling, and direct air capture. Lastly, a Harris Administration would be likely to continue addressing permitting challenges through direct community outreach and engagement with congressional support. Furthermore, Congress would likely be called upon to help smooth the edges on deployment in line with congressional intent, supplement existing programs to meet existing and expanded clean energy transition investments, and ensure that projects meet their milestones and achieve intended results.\n\nTrump-Vance Administration\n\nIn a potential Trump-Vance Administration, it would be imperative to engage Congress to work to save certain programs and projects from rollbacks and recissions. Although it has pivoted at times, the Trump campaign has broadcasted its intent to roll back the BIL and IRA. Though not directly connected to the campaign, Project 2025 proposes to \"eliminate special interest funding programs\" such as the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations and the Loan Programs Office (LPO). For companies and communities that are the beneficiaries of programs, it could be imperative that they work with the DOE and Congress to help ensure that the awards remain active and viable. In 2016, many clean technology investors were slow to become engaged and pivoted their focus to efforts at both the state level and abroad, which eventually proved insufficient. However, through strategic engagement and significant congressional lobbying \u2013 especially for programs such as LPO \u2013 programs that were originally on the chopping block were brought back to life through both Congress and the Trump Administration. Notably in 2020, the Trump Administration issued Executive Order 13817 that expanded the Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing (ATVM) Loan Program to allow for the support of onshoring energy supply chains. Although this program had initially been defunded in annual appropriations, the Trump Administration changed course once it realized the critical value the program possessed and its capacity to further U.S. competitiveness. With billions of dollars likely to still be available in 2025, the ATVM program remains a strategic tool for the U.S. government as it works to onshore a secure resilient supply chain and continues to ensure that the U.S. gains a competitive edge against China.\n\nDivided Government\n\nIn either scenario, Congress will remain essential to ensuring the overall success of BIL and IRA investments, as well as addressing outstanding needs that still exist after programmatic deployment. Notably, GOP House of Representatives members are signaling that a sweeping repeal of the IRA tax credits is not preferred. In August 2024, 18 Republicans wrote to House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) saying that repealing the credits could undermine growth in the energy sector. Energy grants, loans and tax credits have spurred innovation, incentivized investment and created hundreds of thousands of bipartisan jobs across the country. Revoking these programs just as benefits begin to materialize is hopefully not going to be an easy proposition.\n\nThe programs created have been widely popular and well received within the U.S. market. The oversubscription highlights their popularity and the immense demand, with applications in many cases exceeding available capacity by more than tenfold. For example, the DOE received 79 concept papers for Hydrogen Hubs, encouraged 33 to submit full applications and ultimately funded seven projects.\n\nSimilarly, the DOE reviewed 411 concepts across all subsectors for Industrial Decarbonization, and these projects requested more than $60 billion in federal funds \u2013 10 times the amount Congress appropriated for the program. DOE encouraged 130 to submit full applications and selected 33 to proceed to award negotiations.\n\nPrograms aimed at enhancing grid flexibility and resilience of the power system against growing threats of extreme weather and climate change are equally oversubscribed. In the first solicitation, DOE received more than 300 applications requesting over $19 billion \u2013 five times more than the $3.5 billion available for selected projects. Interest is evident from the private sector, and depending on the balance of power in Congress, further support for these investments may be pursued to sustain momentum and to bolster U.S. development.\n\nBoth parties have become increasingly concerned and engaged on issues related to countering China's influence, mainly addressing these concerns by shoring up domestic energy supply chains. There is growing support for government interventions to bolster the critical minerals industry, which is essential to the clean energy transition and U.S. manufacturing.\n\nIt has been reported that efforts being considered within the current Biden Administration as well as on Capitol Hill to establish demand-side price supports for critical mineral projects are being undercut by cheaper Chinese materials. A price floor for critical minerals would cover the difference between the products, helping U.S. companies weather the unstable markets impacted by manipulation. The House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party has made similar recommendations regarding a \"Resilient Resource Reserve\" for critical minerals in its December 2023 report. This policy has also garnered interest from DOE officials who have acknowledged the adverse impact on the industry and are committed to mitigating these effects. They view this intervention as a targeted but temporary measure designed to stabilize the market during a critical phase of development, ensuring a smoother transition to a self-sustaining ecosystem. The Harris campaign has also expressed interest and support for this policy, framing the issue as an \"economic and national security\" necessity to counter China's dominance in electric vehicles (EVs) and clean energy supply chains. Demand side tools could be used for price-sensitive commodities, including clean steel, aluminum and cement, to help derisk project development to attract private financing.\n\nAdditionally, Sens. John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.) and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) have been working across the aisle to creatively support responsible domestic mining efforts. They have introduced two bills targeting the domestic mining industry, offering research and development support and spearheading the development of a national strategy to meet the growing demand for critical minerals. In the House, Reps. Paul Tonko (D-N.Y.) and Garret Graves (R-La.) introduced bipartisan legislation aimed at enhancing transparency in critical materials. The Critical Material Transparency and Reporting of Advanced Clean Energy (Critical Material TRACE) Act proposes the establishment of a DOE program to implement digital identification systems for battery materials.\n\nRegardless of the majority party in either chamber, there is no doubt that addressing the challenges of critical minerals will remain a priority. This focus will require continued investment, collaboration and input from stakeholders to develop sustainable solutions that support resilient supply chains for energy security.\n\nHolland & Knight Insights\n\nIt has become increasingly evident that to ensure the overall success and continuation of the BIL and IRA programs and projects, ongoing executive branch and congressional engagement will be essential for achieving success in the clean energy transition and maximizing opportunities with the federal government. Holland & Knight's bipartisan, bicameral Public Policy & Regulation Group is a seasoned and fully integrated clean energy policy and legal team focused on engaging with the DOE, Congress and executive branch to help clients realize their goals. To date, the team has helped clients secure and negotiate more than $25 billion of clean energy funding commitments from the DOE and other agencies.\n\nFor more information on how our attorneys and advisors can assist with future DOE funding opportunities, help protect existing DOE investments or advocate for future legislation related to clean energy funding and finance, please reach out to the authors.\n\nInformation contained in this alert is for the general education and knowledge of our readers.

        "text": "ACE Releases Updated Issue Brief on Student Voting and Campus Political Campaign Activities\nSection 1 Content\n\n\u200bA majority of young Americans say they are likely to vote this year, comprising nearly one-fifth of the electorate, and 16 million Americans will have their first opportunity to participate in a presidential election. College students have a constitutional right to vote where they are residing while attending an institution.\n\nThat\u2019s some of the background noted in ACE\u2019s updated issue brief, Student Voting and College Political Campaign-Related Activities in 2024.\n\nThe issue brief notes that, \u201cthe rules for participating as voters in our country\u2019s democratic process can quickly feel complex to young voters, particularly students attending college away from home. Voting is controlled by the states, within an increasingly fraught and contested context regarding the legality of varying and often-changing voter registration requirements.\u201d\n\nIt is an update of ACE\u2019s 2023 publication suggesting steps colleges and universities can take to enable students to cast their ballots, including ways to fulfill schools\u2019 obligations under the Higher Education Act. It emphasizes that institutions should take care to ensure that the voting resources offered to their students are nonpartisan and that their communications with students are received that way, and it also provides rules of the road for institutions and campus community members regarding involvement in political campaign-related activities.\n\nThe issue brief, prepared by ACE Vice President and General Counsel Peter McDonough and Hogan Lovells U.S. LLP, offers illustrative examples of what is likely to be permissible and impermissible. It does not seek to address other issues, such as freedom of speech and civility, and it does not constitute legal advice. Institutions are reminded to examine issues that are addressed in the issue brief based on their own unique situations, policies, geographical and political context, and their own counsel\u2019s interpretation of relevant law.\n\n\u201cAs we have seen during the last academic year, issue advocacy on campuses by faculty, staff, students, and unaffiliated members of the public can quickly become intertwined with, and even fueled by, national and international politics and candidates for election,\u201d states the issue brief. \u201cAs we approach the 2024 elections, it may get harder, in some circumstances, to distinguish between permissible issue advocacy and problematic political campaign-related activities.\u201d",

        "text": "Policy Analysis: 2024 US Presidential Election\nAlthough the position of the two presidential candidates on the ongoing war on Gaza can be perceived as significantly different by some observers, when taking a closer look at the two, it becomes clear that they both will continue to provide weapons to Israel to continue its massive attacks. Further, they both will not take serious action to end the blockade on the Palestinian civilians in Gaza. They both emphasize the need to release the Israeli hostages as a priority over anything else, and both candidates ignore Palestinian prisoners, including the massive numbers of women and children who are imprisoned, and others who are being killed in Gaza. In their debate, they both unequivocally stated and even competed to prove their commitment to support Israel despite its disproportionate military responses and attacks that have amounted to crimes in Gaza and Lebanon.\n\nNevertheless, they differ in their public support for Netanyahu. Harris has given less praise and skipped attending his speech to Congress (but met with him privately), while Trump has endorsed Netanyahu\u2019s war on Gaza and urged him to achieve the objectives and \"finish the job.\u201d Harris has clearly expressed her support for a two-state solution while Trump has been silent on this issue during his campaign. Since March 2024, and in the presidential debate, Harris called for an immediate cease-fire and symbolically or partially recognized the suffering of the Palestinian side. Trump has ignored all the human suffering on the Palestinian side and did not state his commitment to a two-state solution.\n\nRegardless of the above differences and similarities between the two candidates, their actions and statements have certainly failed to stop the war or enforce the belated UN call for a ceasefire. The two candidates are perceived by many Americans, especially young, Muslim and Arab voters as complacent or even directly implicated with the war crimes in Gaza and Lebanon.\n\n-SIS professor Mohammed Abu-Nimer\n\nI'll start with a disclaimer: Forecasting policy stances is tricky in the middle of an election campaign and in the middle of a war that escalates and expands by the day.\n\nIn principle, Harris\u2019s positions on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the Middle East more broadly seem to be rather similar to her predecessor, but there might be some nuance to them that could result in important changes. Currently, Harris is careful in pronouncing these differences\u2014both because she is still the Vice President and because of electoral considerations. She will likely be less careful after the elections should she win. Like Biden, Harris is likely to continue being a strong supporter of Israel, on the one hand, and to push for a negotiated end of the war on the other. That end would include the release of the Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, an IDF withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, the creation of a Palestinian government not controlled by Hamas, and the start of the rehabilitation of Gaza. Like Biden, she would like to tie this end of the immediate war to a longer-term process to create an independent Palestinian state next to Israel and a regional reconciliation. I believe, though, that Harris will be much more forceful and public about this policy and more willing to coerce Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to end the war. The US has many tools to affect such an end, and while Biden hesitated to use these tools, Harris is likely to be more willing to use them towards what she sees as the common interest of Israel and the Palestinians.\n\nTrump is much harder to predict on this topic, as oftentimes considerations of ego and shallow understanding of the conflict from both Trump and his advisors prevent the formation of a coherent policy. Trump had some conflict with Netanyahu over the \u201caudacity\u201d of the latter to congratulate President Joe Biden after his election win. Nevertheless, these issues have now been cleared, and Trump is likely to be (like in his first term) a full-throated supporter of Netanyahu\u2019s policies. Netanyahu\u2019s current policy is to keep the war(s) going on as much as possible for the benefit of his political and personal political goals. Trump\u2019s support of Netanyahu and his policy is likely to remain consistent, despite throwing around some vague hints about ending the war as soon as he is President. Those statements are meant to steal some voices of Arab Americans away from Harris. If the war will somehow affect Trump\u2019s personal business dealings then his considerations might change in the future.\n\n-SIS professor Boaz Atzili",

        "text": "Election 2024: Which Party Will Control Congress?\nMost of the talk about Election 2024 has focused on the race for the White House. But almost as consequential will be which party wins control of the House and Senate. Those contests look to be nip and tuck, just like the presidential race.\n\nTo review where things stand going into the election, control of Congress is divided. Republicans run the House. But just barely. Their margin is 220 to 212, with three seats vacant. That is one of the narrowest margins in the history of the House. That has consequences. If five Republicans defect on any vote, they lose their majority.\n\nThe margin in the Senate is also close but favors the Democrats. They hold forty-seven seats, and four Independents caucus with them. That two-vote margin is deceptive. The Senate filibuster limits the power of the majority. Most, though not all legislation, needs sixty votes to clear the Senate. That gives Senate Republicans influence that their House Democratic counterparts lack.\n\nThe Water's Edge James M.

They fared much better than expected in the 2022 elections. Midterm usually mean big losses for the president\u2019s party, especially when the economy is doing as poorly as it was two years ago. But Democrats held their losses to just seven seats. While many Democrats were grumbling this summer that President Joe Biden would be an albatross on their chances to retake the House, his departure from the race and the smooth transition to Kamala Harris stirred newfound optimism.\n\nNonetheless, control of the House looks to be a coin flip. One reason is that the outcome of most House races is already known. The combination of the heavy partisan lean in most states\u2014good luck winning a House seat as a Democrat in Utah or as a Republican in Massachusetts\u2014and gerrymandering means that only 10 percent of House races are competitive. Not surprisingly, both parties are pouring money into those races. That helps keep them competitive. Voters could still break heavily for one party or the other in these competitive races, handing a comfortable majority to either the Democrats or Republicans. But we won\u2019t know until the votes are counted.\n\nThings look similar on the Senate side. One difference with the Senate is that only one-third of seats are up for grabs in any election. This year that means thirty-four Senate races. That map looks to favors Republicans. Democrats and Independents are defending twenty-three seats, while Republicans are defending just eleven. All those seats are in states that Donald Trump won in 2020.\n\nThe bad news for Democrats is the Senator Joe Manchin, who became an Independent earlier this year, has declined to run for reelection. The Republican candidate seeking his seat in deep red West Viginia should win in a landslide. Meanwhile, Democratic Senator Jon Tester is running behind his Republican opponent in Montana. That has left Democrats hoping they can defend all their other seats and pull off a surprise victory in another red state. Their best chances are in Florida and Texas, where incumbent Senators Rick Scott and Ted Cruz have small leads, and in Nebraska where independent Dan Osborn is leading incumbent Deb Fischer in some polls. (Osborn, who initially sought the Democratic nomination, says if he wins a Senate seat he hopes to create an \u201cindependent caucus\u201d rather than side with either the Democrats or the Republicans.) But that looks to be a tall task. So the conventional wisdom for now is that Republicans will retake the Senate.\n\nThe vote counts in these competitive races will be buffeted by the same misinformation and disinformation plaguing the presidential election. And the source won\u2019t be just irate domestic partisans and troublemakers. Russia, China, and Cuba are already trying to interfere in some congressional races. They won\u2019t stop on November 5. In some races, the vote count could last for days if not weeks. So it is possible that who controls Congress will not be known on Election Night.\n\nThe size of the majorities in the House and Senate will matter nearly as much as which party holds them. Small majorities are harder to manage because a few maverick members can derail legislation. Just look at the challenges Chuck Schumer, Kevin McCarthy, and Mike Johnson faced in the current Congress. Now imagine a situation in which a decision by an Independent like Osborn to caucus or not caucus with the Democrats or the Republicans decides controls of the Senate. That majority likely will be fragile.\n\nIt also will matter whether one party controls both the House and Senate, or if Democrats and Republicans split control. Getting Congress to work is harder in the latter case. The concessions needed to get bicameral agreement can become what persuades maverick legislators in the majority party to bolt.\n\nA Congress that struggles to discharge its constitutional duties will complicate U.S. foreign policy. It is true that presidents have more freedom of action overseas than at home. But they do not make foreign policy as they wish. Their challenge is greatest when they face a divided Congress. Just look at Biden\u2019s struggle to persuade Congress to send more aid to Ukraine. If divided government means that the opposition party controls the Senate, the next president could struggle with the basic task of assembling a Cabinet and staffing other senior administration positions. As has been evident for the last decade, politics doesn\u2019t stop at the water\u2019s edge.\n\nSo when it comes to congressional races, the same advice applies as for presidential races: Buckle up. There could be substantial turbulence ahead.\n\nCampaign Update\n\nThe chances of another Harris-Trump debate look to have gone to zero. Harris accepted CNN\u2019s offer for an October 23 debate, but Trump let yesterday\u2019s deadline for accepting the invitation pass without formally responding. The former president was emphatic, however, in a Truth Social post on Wednesday night about his position on another debate: \u201cTHERE WILL BE NO REMATCH!\u201d The Harris campaign denounced Trump\u2019s decision as \u201ca disservice to the American people.\u201d With another debate off the table, Harris and CNN agreed to turn the October 23 event into a televised town hall.\n\nDebates aren\u2019t the only thing Trump has taken a pass on. His campaign has so far declined to participate in the official presidential transition process. The Presidential Transition Act established a process by which presidential nominees can prepare before Election Day for assuming office should they win. Each campaign is given office space, transition funding, and a jumpstart on getting security clearances for their incoming teams. The Trump campaign has not said why it has declined to participate in a process that would maximize the chances it can hit the ground running on January 20. One possibility is that the Trump campaign prefers not to accept the limits on transition fundraising that come with accepting government support.\n\nBiden denounced Trump on Wednesday for having \u201cled an onslaught of lies\u201d about the federal government\u2019s response to the destruction caused by Hurricane Helene. Trump has falsely claimed, among other things, that Biden had not returned calls from Georgia\u2019s governor, that the federal government was denying help to Republican areas, and that the Biden administration had diverted disaster assistance to help support illegal immigrants. Trump\u2019s fabrications have not dented his poll numbers.\n\nThe Uncommitted Campaign, the pro-Palestinian group critical of President Joe Biden\u2019s response to the war in Gaza, announced last month that it would not endorse Harris. That position was good news for Trump, whom the group acknowledged was even less sympathetic to its position. The reality of that fact looks to have sunk in. This week an Uncommitted leader posted a video saying that \u201cTrump\u2019s allies are openly pushing for the destruction of Palestinian human rights and silencing those who fight back.\u201d As a result, the group is now urging its supporters \u201cto orient less toward who is the better candidate and more toward what is the better antiwar approach in building our collective power.\u201d\n\nWhat the Candidates Are Saying\n\nOn Monday night, CBS\u2019s 60 Minutes released its interview with Harris. Correspondent Bill Whitaker spent some time on foreign policy. When it came to Israel, Harris sidestepped a question about whether Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was an ally, saying that \u201cthe American people and the Israeli people are allies.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if she would be willing to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin about the war in Ukraine, Harris answered: \u201cNot bilaterally without Ukraine. No. Ukraine must have a say in the future of Ukraine.\u201d She went to add that questions about expanding NATO to include Ukraine \u201care all issues that we will deal with if and when it arrives at that point. Right now, we are supporting Ukraine\u2019s ability to defend itself against Russia\u2019s unprovoked aggression.\u201d\n\nHarris was asked about China but never ventured, and was not pushed, to go beyond boilerplate responses. She said that the United States \u201cmust win the competition for the twenty-first century with China. We must be able to compete and win.\u201d She also said that she was not \u201cgoing to get into hypotheticals\u201d when asked if she would order the U.S. military to defend Taiwan. Given that the official U.S. policy on Taiwan for the past four decades has been one of strategic ambiguity, that was an appropriate answer to give.\n\nIn a bonus video that CBS released, Whitaker asked Harris which country she considers to be the greatest adversary of the United States. She answered: \u201cThere\u2019s an obvious one in mind, which is Iran.\u201d That comment caused a tizzy among national security types. They were quick to argue that China is the greatest adversary the United States faces today, which is undoubtedly true. But the United States is also closer now to conflict with Iran than it is with China. And Harris was clearly right to say that \u201cIran has American blood on their hands.\u201d\n\nOne viewer who was not impressed with Harris\u2019s answers was Trump. In a post on Truth Social, he called for revoking CBS\u2019s broadcast license. He complained that 60 Minutes edited the interview to make Harris to look good and demanded that CBS released an unedited transcript of Harris\u2019s conversation with Whitaker.\n\nAt a rally in Juneau, Wisconsin, on Sunday, Trump returned to a favorite talking point, tariffs. He said he was willing to impose tariffs as high as 200 percent on Chinese vehicles imported from Mexico. In a speech to the Detroit Economic Club yesterday, he said he would be willing to go to \u201c1,000 percent\u201d tariffs. Perhaps more significantly, he said that should he become president he plans to \u201cformally notify Mexico and Canada to invoke the six-year renegotiation of the USMCA to seek strong new protections against trans-shipments so that China and other nations cannot smuggle their auto parts through Mexico.\u201d The Harris campaign quickly pointed out that the vice president made the same pledge weeks ago.\n\nWhat the Pundits Are Saying\n\nJeffrey A. Friedman and Andrew Payne argued in Foreign Affairs that it is a myth that foreign policy doesn\u2019t matter in U.S. presidential elections. They summarize their case this way: \u201cEven if voters attach limited significance to individual foreign policy issues, they want to make sure that candidates are fit to serve as the country\u2019s commander in chief.\u201d The first half of that sentence concedes the point that most discussions in this genre make, namely, that most voters are not pulling the lever for one candidate versus another based on their stances on foreign policy issues. Friedman and Payne\u2019s broader point that voters favor candidates they see as strong is undoubtedly true. No candidate runs for office championing their weakness. But how voters decide who is strong and who is not may have nothing to do with foreign policy. Indeed, the causal arrow may go in the other direction. Voters may decide they like a candidate, and as a result, see whatever the candidate says about foreign policy as exemplifying strength.\n\nThe Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget released a report this week assessing the fiscal impact of the policy changes that Harris and Trump propose to enact should they make it to the White House. Such forecasts are difficult to make because campaigns seldom spell out their proposals in great detail. Even when details exist, some uncertainty inevitably exists over the precise impact that changes might have. While noting these challenges, the Committee concluded: \u201cUnder our low- and high-cost estimates, we estimate Vice President Harris\u2019s plan could have no significant fiscal impact or increase debt by $8.10 trillion through 2035, while President Trump\u2019s plan could increase debt by between $1.45 and $15.15 trillion.\u201d The price tag on Trump\u2019s tax plan went up this week after he pledged to end \u201cdouble taxation\u201d on Americans living overseas and to make interest on car loans tax deductible. One conservative economist quipped that Trump was offering \u201cice cream and candy with none of the vegetables\u201d with his growing list of tax breaks for all kinds of voters.\n\nPrinceton Professor Julian Zelizer asked in Foreign Policy whether \u201cOctober surprises\u201d are overblown. After reviewing an array of surprise events in the final month of various presidential campaigns, he concludes that \u201cthe breaking news of an October surprise didn\u2019t change the outcome.\u201d The fact that polls have barely budged over the past month, despite two debates, a second attempt on Trump\u2019s life, and a widening war in the Middle East, suggests that Election 2024 will break the historical pattern. That\u2019s especially the case with the growth of early and mail-in voting. Millions of Americans have already made their choice for president.\n\nProPublica\u2019s Doug Bock Clark and Heather Vogell explored how a change that Georgia\u2019s Election Board recently made to the state\u2019s election procedures could shift the outcome of the presidential race in the Peachtree State. The new rule empowers county election boards to toss out votes from whole precincts if they determine that there have been voting irregularities. The rule change was pushed primarily by Republicans and Trump supporters. The rule gives local elections boards great discretion to determine when irregularities occur, and election boards in several Georgia countries are controlled by officials who contend that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump. A Georgia court is now considering legal challenges to the procedural change. Polls currently show Trump with a one-point lead over Harris in Georgia, meaning that concerns that a misuse of this new discretion could change the election\u2019s outcome are not misplaced.\n\nConcerns that election deniers might try to put their thumb on the electoral scale next month are not limited to Georgia. Reuters\u2019 Joseph Tanfani and Nathan Layne found \u201c37 election skeptics on the election boards of the five most populous counties in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina and Pennsylvania\u2013including 20 who have voted in the past to not certify results. Many smaller county boards in those states also include election deniers. Wisconsin was the only swing state whose big county election boards appeared free of such skeptics.\u201d 60 Minutes ran a segment this week on how the senior election official in Maricopa County, Arizona, which encompasses Phoenix and surrounding areas, was defeated this past summer in his primary reelection bid by a fellow Republican who questions the integrity of Arizona\u2019s 2020 vote count.\n\nIn all, if the presidential race turns out as close as the polls show, contested counts in the battleground states will be inevitable, as will be a surge in Hurricane Helene-style disinformation.\n\nWhat the Polls Show\n\nThe New York Times\u2019s Nate Cohn assessed why some polls show Harris leading nationally but neck to neck in northern battleground states, while others show the reverse. His answer is methodological: \u201cThis divide is almost entirely explained by whether a pollster uses \u201cweighting on recalled vote,\u201d which means trying to account for how voters say they voted in the last election.\u201d While that distinction is only meaningful to pollsters\u2014and not reducible to a one-sentence summary\u2014it highlights that even scientific polls reflect a fair amount of art.\n\nGallup reported that 40 percent of American voters plan to cast their ballots early this year. Democratic voters (46 percent) are more likely to say they will vote early than Independents (43 percent) and Republicans (31 percent). Half of Trump\u2019s supporters do not expect him to concede if he loses.\n\nThe Pew Research Center found that three-quarters of Americans think that Harris will concede the election is she loses but that only a quarter of Americans think that Trump will concede if he loses. Half of Trump supporters agree that he will not concede the election.\n\nThe Campaign Schedule\n\nElection Day is twenty-five days away (November 5, 2024).\n\nElectors will meet in each state and the District of Columbia to cast their votes for president and vice president in sixty-seven days (December 17, 2024).\n\nThe 119th U.S. Congress will be sworn into office in eighty-four days (January 3, 2025).\n\nThe U.S. Congress will certify the results of the 2024 presidential election in eighty-seven days (January 6, 2025).\n\nInauguration Day is 101 days away (January 20, 2025).\n\nOscar Berry assisted in the preparation of this post.",

        "text": "The US Election and Bulgaria\nBulgaria\u2019s ties with the United States have reached heights never thought possible at the end of the communist dictatorship in 1989. Moscow\u2019s once most loyal satellite has become one of the most important US allies on the Balkan peninsula. Most Bulgarians see Washington as their country\u2019s most important geopolitical and military partner. Bulgaria joined NATO in 2004 and signed a defense cooperation agreement with the United States in 2006. Their militaries jointly use bases in Bulgaria, which is vital for ensuring the safety of the country and the region.\n\nThe United States has provided critical support to Bulgaria politically and economically as it moved forward in democratization after communist rule, including by investing hundreds of millions of dollars through the US Agency for International Development (USAID). This has helped strengthen the country\u2019s rule of law, governance, civil society, and business environment. The United States has also become an important economic partner with bilateral trade increasing and a constantly rising number of companies present in the country, employing tens of thousands.\n\nThe outcome of the US election will not radically affect the relationship between the two countries in the short term. They will continue to be partners across various fields including defense, energy, and trade. However, in the long run, the nature of the next US administration will be of key importance for Bulgaria.\n\nRussia and its proxies in Bulgaria have continuously tried eroding its democracy to change its stance as a committed member of the EU and NATO. These proxies are actors from the old, corrupt political status quo, who have been responsible for the unwillingness and inability since 1989 to combat Russian influence and corruption or to fully consolidate democracy. The status quo started to crumble in 2020, and more so after the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and with it Russia\u2019s influence in the country. This has led to repeated snap elections, with the latest ones coming on October 27. The repeated collapse of governments and the recent introduction of authoritarian measures like the Russia-style anti-LGBTQ+ law show that the status quo actors are trying to regain their position and are by no means defeated yet.\n\nSince the invasion of Ukraine, Washington has placed more importance on Sofia as a security partner in the region.\n\nWith a Kamala Harris presidency, the United States would certainly maintain the Biden administration\u2019s approach, not least regarding commitment to NATO and help for Ukraine. Since the invasion of Ukraine, Washington has placed more importance on Sofia as a security partner in the region. Bulgaria is rearming itself with US-made military equipment, most notably by signing a contract for Stryker armored fighting vehicles in January, and the country\u2019s hosts one the new multinational NATO battlegroups. A Harris administration would also mean continuity in US policy toward Europe, notably in support for democracy, civil society, and the rule of law, including in Bulgaria.\n\nBy contrast, a new Donald Trump administration would presumably pursue isolationist and protectionist policies, and it would not prioritize relations with Europe. In this context, and given what Trump has said about supporting Ukraine and the role of NATO, his administration would not see Bulgaria as a key partner in the region. Washington would also very likely stop treating support for democracy and civil society in countries like Bulgaria as something important. Ultimately, this would have negative consequences for the democracy and security prospects of Bulgaria and the region.\n\nThe stronger Bulgarian-US cooperation is, the weaker Russia\u2019s influence through its proxies, and the healthier Bulgaria\u2019s democracy. After the election, the United States will need not only to maintain the course of productive partnership but also to increase it where possible, and at least in the three core areas.\n\nFirst, military cooperation and US funds for it should be increased. This process needs to be intensified as Bulgaria desperately needs more US weapons and know-how to end its dependence on Soviet-era arms and to be prepared to face military threats efficiently.\n\nSecond, USAID should invest more in strengthening civil society and the rule of law in Bulgaria, given the passage of repressive laws. Civil society needs US support and expertise to maintain its role as a guarantor of a strong democracy. Moreover, the trend of greater investments in Bulgaria in recent years should be encouraged and supported by the US government, to the extent possible.\n\nThird, the United States should consider sanctioning more Bulgarian politicians and officials associated with the old status quo through its Global Magnitsky Sanctions Program. Such sanctions help civil society combat corruption, and by extension Russia\u2019s influence, which ultimately strengthens Bulgaria\u2019s democracy. Washington has more than ever a crucial role in this as the EU has for years been unwilling to adequately address the issue of corruption in Bulgaria.\n\nThis article is part of series in which GMF experts from Central and Eastern Europe set out the implications of a Harris or Trump win in the US presidential election for the countries in the region.",

        "text": "How the U.S. presidential campaigns are targeting digital ads by zip code\nIf you want to know anything about what digital ads the Kamala Harris and Donald Trump presidential campaigns are running, and in what locales they\u2019re running which ads, Penn\u2019s Andrew Arenge is your guy. He has, after all, watched more than 15,000 locally targeted digital ads across the two campaigns\u2014and that doesn't even include ones running statewide or nationwide.\n\nArenge, director of operations for the Penn Program on Opinion Research and Election Studies, created a dashboard showing targeted digital ad spending from the Biden and then Harris campaign and one for the Trump campaign. Users can see the states and individual zip codes where the campaigns have targeted ads, how much money the campaigns have spent, and which topics are aimed at which zip codes, such as the economy, health care, democracy, immigration, crime, abortion, and Project 2025.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve long been convinced that this data is a good leading indicator of where the candidates are putting their resources and how are they thinking about where their voters live,\u201d Arenge says. \u201cFolks just haven\u2019t taken the time to understand it, and to try and find meaningful insights.\u201d\n\nHe was clued in earlier than most that North Carolina, which the Republican candidate has carried the past three presidential elections, is now in play. He noticed that the Trump campaign began targeting zip codes in Maine\u2019s 2nd Congressional District, which Trump won in 2020 and 2016, and that the former president started running an ad about fracking in western Pennsylvania. He saw that in mid-September, the Harris campaign began running ads in heavily Arab American neighborhoods in Michigan.\n\nRunning ads on Google, Snapchat, Twitter, and Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, gives campaigns the ability \u201cto target much more granularly\u201d than with TV ads, Arenge says. But, he says, overall, digital ad spending remains much lower than TV spending. He has found that Democrats are spending significantly more on digital ads than Republicans and are doing more specific geotargeting.\n\n\u201cIt struck me that we are all blinded by our own experience. I know what ads I\u2019ve seen, partially because I pay really close attention to it, but I have no idea what ads you\u2019ve seen,\u201d Arenge says.\n\nHe created a third dashboard with daily spending on Meta by each campaign. He noticed that compared to 2020, spending is down on Meta ads across platforms but up on Google, and that spending on Meta ads from the Harris campaign spiked after the debate.\n\nAlthough Arenge launched the dashboards this spring, they are an evolution of a five-year project. In 2019, he noticed that in the wake of the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal, some tech companies had launched data transparency platforms. He has been downloading Meta\u2019s daily spending report every day since, and over time has also been paying attention to what other platforms were releasing.\n\nIn the 2020 election, he noticed the Biden campaign was targeting different messages at different communities. For example, a video running in some Pennsylvania zip codes focused on his religiosity in broad terms, whereas one in other zip codes highlighted his Catholicism.\n\nBut Arenge thought the data was not presented in a helpful manner, and \u201cit struck me that somebody should do something to make it easier to understand what messages they are running where and how much they are spending in different places,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cI care about everything and am really fascinated by all the geographies,\u201d he says, \u201cbut the average person only cares about where they live.\u201d\n\nHis dashboard has gone through multiple iterations and benefitted from user feedback, he says. He captures the data on targeted ads, watches each ad, quickly determines the main topic of each, and puts the data through a script that codes spending by zip code.\n\n\u201cThe ads that everybody talks about generally aren\u2019t always the ads that they\u2019re putting money behind,\u201d Arenge says, noting that there\u2019s a fascinating dichotomy between the ads journalists tweet about and the highest spends.\n\nArenge says his goal is to keep the dashboards as updated as possible through the election. \u201cThere\u2019s more I want to do with it all that\u2019s more academically oriented, paper-wise,\u201d he says, \u201cbut as I like to joke, that\u2019s a 2025 problem, because there are only so many hours in a day.\u201d",

The balance of power in Congress is also at stake, with all 435 House seats and 33 Senate seats up for election. Key issues such as the economy, healthcare, and climate change are driving voter concerns.\n\nIn Virginia, several important races are unfolding.

        "text": "Can illegal immigrants really vote in the US election?\nCan illegal immigrants really vote in the US election?\n\nGetty Images\n\nDonald Trump and his Republican allies have repeatedly claimed that the Democrats are planning to get illegal immigrants to vote in the US election. \u201cOur elections are bad, and a lot of these illegal immigrants coming in, they're trying to get them to vote,\u201d Trump said during the presidential debate with Kamala Harris. BBC Verify has identified more than 100 paid-for ads on Facebook and Instagram posted by Republicans since the start of September focusing on the issue. It is illegal for a non-US citizen to vote in a national election, but studies suggest cases of this actually happening are very rare.\n\nWhat laws are in place to stop illegal immigrants voting?\n\nThe Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 prohibits non-citizens - which includes illegal immigrants - from voting in federal elections. The punishment includes a year in prison, a fine, and possibly deportation. Every state is required to use a common registration form which requires people to confirm they are US citizens, under penalty of perjury for false claims, but does not require documentary proof. \u201cThat first step of having to tick a box saying you\u2019re a citizen to register to vote is a huge deterrent for illegal immigrants, as it\u2019s hugely risky to lie,\u201d says Jasleen Singh, a voting expert at the liberal policy think tank Brennan Center for Justice. In many states, voter rolls are cross-referenced with citizenship and immigration services, death certificates, and postal records to make sure that people who are non-citizens, dead, or live out of state are not registered to vote. \u201cAt the polls, there\u2019s a list of eligible voters, and if a non-citizen turns up, they\u2019ll be turned away or told to cast a provisional ballot which will only be accepted if they can provide proof of citizenship,\u201d says Prof Ronald Hayduk, a voting rights expert at San Francisco State University. Non-citizens are not allowed to vote in state-wide elections either. However, some municipalities in California, Maryland, Vermont and Washington DC do allow them to vote in certain local elections, such as for school boards.\n\nWhat evidence is there that illegal immigrants vote?\n\nA number of studies, both from conservative and left-leaning organisations, suggest instances of illegal immigrants voting in US federal elections are very rare. One by the Brennan Center for Justice interviewed 44 election officials who worked across 12 states during the 2016 election. It found that out of 23.5 million votes counted in these states, an estimated 30 suspected incidents of non-citizens voting were referred for further investigation. That\u2019s about 0.0001% of all votes cast. An analysis of a database which collected election fraud cases between 1999 and 2023 by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group, found 77 instances of non-citizens voting. A number of other reports, including by the Cato Institute, a conservative think tank, entitled \u2018Non-citizens Don\u2019t Illegally Vote in Detectable Numbers\u2019, come to similar conclusions. \"According to many sources of evidence, the number of non-citizens who vote in elections is very small,\" says Walter Olson, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute who's written a number of reports on voter fraud. \"It's not zero, some people slip through the cracks for various reasons, but it's nowhere near at the level to impact the outcome of an election.\"\n\nWhat evidence do Republicans cite?\n\nThe Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, a Republican proposal which would require people to prove their citizenship when registering to vote, has been rejected in the House of Representatives. Republican lawmakers continue to push for more citizenship requirements. \u201cWe have a number of states who have done audits of their voter rolls and found thousands of non-citizens,\u201d the lead Republican in the House, Mike Johnson, told CNN. He highlighted Ohio, Pennsylvania and Georgia - three states where polls show a tight race between Trump and Kamala Harris. In Ohio, a review called for by Republican officials in the state, found that out of about eight million registered voters, there were 597 cases which have been referred for \u201cfurther review and potential prosecution\u201d for non-citizens registering to vote. In Pennsylvania, a glitch with electronic touchscreens in state drivers' licence centres wrongly showed non-citizens the option to register to vote while getting new or updated licences. This glitch was in the system between 2006 and 2017, and has since been resolved. In 2017, Pennsylvania state election officials said non-citizen immigrants might have cast 544 ballots illegally out of more than 93 million ballots in elections dating back to 2000. In Georgia, a review of voter rolls in 2022 found 1,634 people \u201chad attempted to register to vote\u201d but \u201cwere not able to be verified\u201d, out of about seven million registered voters. \u201cVoter fraud and illegal immigrants voting is so rare that this myth is to sow doubt in election integrity and lay the groundwork to cast doubt on the election outcome,\u201d argues Ms Singh.\n\nRepublican ads sow further doubt\n\nBBC Verify has identified 118 paid-for ads posted on Facebook and Instagram since 1 September by Republican candidates or by Republican political groups which claim widespread voter registration of non-citizens, or which raise the question of whether non-citizens should be allowed to vote in elections. The ads we identified were shown between 7.8 and nine million times on the platforms. One - which had more than 2.4 million views - invites users to participate in a poll with the question: \"Should illegal immigrants be allowed to vote?\" Another ad posted by Congresswoman Ann Wagner, with more than 900,000 views, invites users to answer the same question.\n\nFacebook",

        "text": "Hurricane disinformation rampant in US election campaign \u2013 DW \u2013 10\nHundreds of people have lost their lives to hurricanes Helene and Milton in the southern US. On the campaign trail, Donald Trump is spreading hurricane disinformation, but Republicans are criticizing Kamala Harris.\n\nJoe Biden had had enough. This was very clear when the US president gave a short statement to journalists on Thursday afternoon.\n\n\"Anyone who seeks to take advantage of our fellow Americans' desperation, whether you're a company engaging in price gouging or a citizen trying to scam your neighbors: we'll go after you and we'll hold you accountable,\" he told reporters in Washington.\n\nBiden was referring to incidents that have taken place in recent days and weeks in the states affected by hurricanes Helene and Milton. For example: People trying to fly out of Florida before Hurricane Milton made landfall in the early hours of Thursday morning reported on social media that they were being quoted exorbitant ticket prices. There were also reports of hugely inflated prices at hotels and private Airbnb accommodation in Florida this week.\n\nBiden, however, didn't just criticize the profiteers. He also condemned the \"reckless, irresponsible disinformation and outright lies that continue to flow\" since Hurricane Helene \u2014 much of which are being spread by the Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump.\n\nTrump spreads dangerous hurricane disinformation\n\nIn late September, Hurricane Helene devastated several southeastern US states, killing more than 200 people. As the cleanup operation was still ongoing, Trump railed against the Biden administration and Vice President Kamala Harris \u2014 who is also his Democratic rival for the presidency on November 5.\n\n\"The White House is doing nothing,\" Trump declared at a campaign appearance in Wisconsin last Sunday. \"They've abandoned us in, you know, what's largely a Republican area\" \u2014 where Helene has caused extensive damage. His followers reacted with vocal outrage.\n\nHurricane Milton leaves path of destruction in Florida To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nBut what Trump said is not true. Republican governors of affected states such as Georgia and Florida have stated that they are in contact with Biden, and have received the help they needed from Washington.\n\nDespite this, Trump's campaign rhetoric about the Biden administration's supposed indifference has resonated with people more powerfully than the truth. \"It has a huge impact on Americans' trust in government,\" said Kathryn Olmsted, a history professor at the University of California, Davis.\n\n\"If a presidential candidate, and former president, tells them that they cannot believe what the current government is saying, and that the current government is refusing to help them and is lying to them, then of course [Trump's] supporters are going to think that what he says is true,\" Olmsted, who conducts research into conspiracy theories, told DW by email.\n\nGovernment battling hurricane rumors online\n\nTrump also criticized FEMA, the US Federal Emergency Management Agency. Claiming that millions of FEMA dollars had gone to irregular migrants, Trump declared that, as a result, there was nothing left for victims of the hurricane. According to the former president, people who had lost everything in the hurricane were getting only $750 (about \u20ac685) in government aid.\n\nHurricane Milton barreled across Florida this week, spawning multiple tornadoes, knocking out power to millions and damaging countless homes and businesses Image: Ricardo Arduengo/REUTERS\n\nThis, too, is false. FEMA does run a program that helps migrants, but the budget for that is completely separate from the funds for disaster relief. And $750 is just the initial emergency aid payment that those affected are being given to buy essentials like food, clothes and baby supplies. After this, those whose houses have been destroyed will be able to claim several thousand dollars in support. FEMA has detailed this information on a website set up specifically to counter disinformation.\n\nThe Biden administration is also actively addressing hurricane disinformation online. The White House has an account on the social media forum Reddit, where it is sharing pictures and information about the government's response to hurricanes Helene and Milton.\n\n'Disinformation makes it more difficult to help people'\n\nIt's an unusual approach by the US government. But so close to the US presidential election, there is more than just its own reputation at stake. The disinformation is harming those most urgently in need of help.\n\n\"Disinformation makes it much more difficult for government officials to help people,\" said Olmsted. \"Victims of a disaster might refuse to go to a shelter, or to evacuate, or to accept aid from the government.\"\n\nUS government fights misinformation over Hurricane Milton To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nShe said the effects of Trump's words could clearly be seen in the way people responded to Hurricane Milton, which tore across Florida this week, causing millions of dollars in damage and killing at least 16 people.\n\n\"I'm sure it affected some Trump supporters,\" said Olmsted. \"He told them not to believe their government officials, so why would they listen to the evacuation orders?\"\n\nHarris' makes controversial appearance on late night TV\n\nVice President Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate, also criticized Trump's behavior in an interview with Stephen Colbert, the TV presenter of \"The Late Show,\" which is regarded as politically liberal.\n\n\"What upsets me so is the idea that any politician would play political games with these folks, with people who are in the midst of such suffering,\" Harris said, on an episode broadcast on Tuesday evening. \"And then, for the sake of political gain, tell these lies in a way that is meant to make people distrust the help that is there for them to receive.\"\n\nHowever, her appearance on the comedy talk show, during which she sipped a beer with Colbert, has made Harris, too, the object of criticism. The presenters of the conservative talk show \"Fox and Friends\" on the Trump-friendly network Fox News described it as extremely inappropriate. A presidential candidate should not be going on \"lighthearted\" programs like the \"The Late Show\" when people in North Carolina were still struggling with the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, they said.\n\nThis article was originally written in German.",

Maxwell Frost , Democrat of Florida\n\n, Democrat of Florida Anthony Salvanto, CBS News director of elections and surveys\n\nClick here to browse full transcripts of \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington.\n\nAnd this week on Face the Nation, we will get a new poll on where the presidential race stands in the final weeks before the election, plus new concerns over disaster funding after two major hurricanes hit the Southeast in recent weeks.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris returned to North Carolina for a second time in two weeks, packing supplies for hurricane victims and campaigning in the all-important battleground state still cleaning up from Hurricane Helene.\n\nAnd on the heels of Hurricane Milton slicing through Florida last week, communities across six states now face a huge price tag to rebuild.\n\nWe will get the latest from Homeland Security chief Alejandro Mayorkas.\n\nMeanwhile, as former President Trump tries to make the storms a liability for his opponent\u2026\n\n(Begin VT)\n\nDONALD TRUMP (Former President of the United States (R) and Current U.S. Presidential Candidate): Biden and Harris have done a horrible job on North Carolina and some of the other ones.\n\n(End VT)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 we will check in with House Speaker Mike Johnson on disaster relief, the campaign and more.\n\nFlorida Congressman Maxwell Frost will also join us.\n\nAnd as the campaign enters the homestretch, we will take the temperature of voters in a new CBS poll and get their thoughts on the future of the country in a focus group interview.\n\nIt's all just ahead on Face the Nation.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.\n\nWith just 23 days until Election Day, large portions of the Southeast are in recovery mode. And presidential candidates are campaigning from coast to coast to get out the vote.\n\nOur new CBS News polls shows the race for the White House remains a toss- up, with Vice President Harris up just three points over former President Donald Trump nationwide 51 percent to 48 percent. That's one point tighter from last month. Among voters in the seven battleground states that will decide this election, it's just a one-point difference 50-49.\n\nMeanwhile, repair and cleanup efforts are under way in both Florida and North Carolina, where more than 260 deaths have been blamed on two major hurricanes. President Biden is in Florida this morning surveying the damage. Vice President Harris will hold a rally later in North Carolina.\n\nAnd we begin this morning with Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.\n\nWelcome back to Face the Nation.\n\nALEJANDRO MAYORKAS (U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security): Good morning, Margaret. And thank you for having me.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Secretary, you oversee FEMA. There is still seven weeks left in hurricane season. FEMA's director says they've already used nearly half of the $20 billion in disaster relief Congress allocated to them.\n\nBut the speaker of the House says FEMA has plenty of resources, they have been slow to respond and that FEMA hasn't actually distributed the money. Can you clear that up?\n\nSECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Margaret, FEMA has the money to address the immediate needs of individuals impacted by Hurricanes Helene and Milton, but we need Congress to act swiftly to fund FEMA, and specifically its Disaster Relief Fund, because hurricane season is not over.\n\nAnd, also, seasons are less and less important now, given the effects of climate change and the increasing gravity and frequency of extreme weather events. And I should say, FEMA has not been slow at all. It already has distributed more than $470 million in relief to individuals impacted by Hurricane Helene.\n\nI take great pride and this nation should take great pride in the extraordinary work of our FEMA personnel and all first responders.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, this is obligated versus distributed. That's where you two are sort of disagreeing with each other, but \u2013 it seems.\n\nBut, before Hurricane Milton hit, you said October 2: \"We do not have the funds,\" FEMA doesn't have the funds, \"to make it through the season and what is imminent.\"\n\nSo, if another hurricane hits before the election, are there funds to deal with that kind of emergency situation?\n\nSECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: We will address the immediate impacts.\n\nBut, remember, immediate impacts speak of immediate needs, meals, potable water, and the like. But, also, we have to ensure that individuals can recover from these extreme disasters, such as rebuilding their homes, repairing damage and the like.\n\nAnd so we need Congress to act swiftly to fund what should be a nonpartisan, apolitical phenomenon, and that is providing relief to all individuals with respect to the impacts of these extreme weather events.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, immediate versus rebuilding. So, you could wait until after the election? Do you know how much you'll need?\n\nSECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: We don't. We don't know.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: OK.\n\nSECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: But we are still, for example, assessing the damage from Hurricane Milton, which is of historic strength.\n\nAnd it also led to approximately 27 different tornadoes. So we don't know the impacts. We don't know what's coming tomorrow.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.\n\nSECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: \u2026 whether it's another hurricane, a tornado, a fire, an earthquake. We have to be ready.\n\nAnd it is not good government to be dependent on a day-to-day existence, as opposed to appropriate planning.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We've seen some dangerous misinformation being amplified online.\n\nFlorida's Governor Ron DeSantis hit back hard at some of these claims that, if you got help from the federal government, somehow, they'd seize your assets in his state. FEMA has been trying to counteract some of these lies as well.\n\nAre you concerned when you see this and how widespread it is that it's a preview of what's to come with the upcoming U.S. election as well, attempts to manipulate people?\n\nSECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Incredibly concerned.\n\nAnd the misinformation \u2013 I should say it's disinformation \u2013 false information deliberately spread to impact people's behavior and perceptions, it is extremely pernicious. We have individuals in need of assistance who are entitled to assistance who aren't seeking it because of the false information.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Who is driving it?\n\nSECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Well, I will tell you what we need.\n\nWe need individuals, elected officials, people who have the platform to really debunk this false information. And we're not seeing enough of that, and I find that to be incredibly irresponsible, and irresponsible to the people who are survivors of these extreme weather events.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You have a big portfolio at Homeland Security. And, of course, the U.S. border is part of that. Border crossings are now at a low for the Biden presidency.\n\nBut our CBS polling shows 65 percent of Trump voters believe the Biden administration is trying to intentionally increase the number of migrants at the border. And among the people who do believe that, three-quarters of them say it's because the administration wants them to vote.\n\nAnd the Speaker of the House just told us that he thinks noncitizens are going to vote, even though this is already illegal under established law.\n\nWhat mechanisms can you tell the public about that exist to prevent this from happening?\n\nSECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: So, what a \u2013 what a powerful example of disinformation.\n\nThere is no facts underlying these assertions. They are extremely damaging. It causes people to lose confidence in the integrity of the election system. And we need people in positions of authority to actually communicate accurate information to the voting public. We \u2013 the numbers that we are experiencing now at the border are actually lower than they were at this time of year in 2019.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.\n\nSECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: And so it's not just over the last three years, but well before them in the pre-COVID times.\n\nAnd the notion, the notion that we in law enforcement have sought the \u2013 to intentionally allow individuals to cross the border illegally for the purpose of voting is preposterous, and everyone should condemn that rhetoric, everyone, regardless of party affiliation.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, on the issue of the actions you've taken to bring these border crossings down, this was President Biden's presidential power.\n\nHe's essentially disqualifying most of those who are entering illegally from being able to get asylum. This was meant to be a temporary policy change. So you took this without having to go to Congress and change the law, in short.\n\nSECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: We took it after Congress failed to take the enduring step\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nSECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: \u2026 of legislation, which was bipartisan in nature.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But \u2013 but, just in doing that, by doing this through presidential power, aren't you essentially doing what Republicans said was possible throughout, which was, with the stroke of a pen, President Biden could stop all of this?\n\nSECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: No.\n\nAnd remember where we were. We were enforcing Title 42, the public health authority, until May of last year. We then sought from Congress additional funding, additional Border Patrol agents, additional Homeland Security Investigations personnel. They did not fund the Department of Homeland Security to enhance our border security.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nSECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: We sought that funding again, again rejected.\n\nA bipartisan group of senators actually presented a\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nSECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: \u2026 the most dramatic change in legislation in over 20 years. Congress was poised to pass it, and then politics got in the way.\n\nSome people would prefer the problem to persist\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nSECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: \u2026 deliver a solution for the American people. The president acted.\n\nAnd, remember, we had to build the capacity to implement so successfully the president's proclamation, and that is indeed what we have been doing month after month.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So \u2013 but on this issue of who is in the country I know, practically speaking, it is very difficult to deport, for example, to the country of Venezuela.\n\nDonald Trump, on the campaign trail, talks a lot about a prison gang from that country, and he argues there's already laws on the books that would allow for the Biden administration to dismantle criminal networks. He says he'd do it.\n\nAre there those laws? You know, are you doing everything you can to combat this transnational criminal organization?\n\nSECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Yes, we are. And I think you're speaking of Tren de Aragua, TDA.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.\n\nSECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Margaret, I was a prosecutor for 12 years. We had criminal gangs to battle back then. We are indeed doing everything we can to dismantle criminal gangs and transnational criminal organizations.\n\nAnd, quite frankly, we've devoted an unprecedented level of resources and personnel and focus to this effort. This is not a new phenomenon, but we are bringing new tools, new capabilities and new resources to the fight.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Can you quickly explain what the status is with this arrest this past week \u2013 or this prosecution we learned of this past week of this Afghan national who was apparently planning an Election Day terrorist attack on behalf of ISIS?\n\nHe was in this country. He had immigration status. Was he radicalized before he came to the United States?\n\nSECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: So, Margaret, it is an ongoing prosecution, so I won't speak of the facts.\n\nBut the viewing public is getting an idea of the breadth and diversity of the missions that we in the Department of Homeland Security tackle.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But it gets to the issue of vetting versus whether he was radicalized here.\n\nSECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Well, remember, the individual came in through parole, an Afghan national. And when we vet, and we do so intensively, when we vet an individual, it's a point-in-time screening and vetting process.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.\n\nSECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: If we obtain information subsequently that suggests the individual could be of danger, we take appropriate law enforcement action. That is exactly what we did in this case,\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.\n\nSecretary Mayorkas, thank you for your time today.\n\nSECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Thank you, Margaret.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We spoke earlier with House Speaker Mike Johnson.\n\nAnd we began by asking him whether Congress will approve more disaster funding for hurricane victims.\n\n(Begin VT)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You have visited some of these disaster zones yourself.\n\nAnd Punchbowl News quotes you as saying that Congress may eventually have to pass an aid package that could reach as high as $100 billion.\n\nLast Sunday on this program, Thom Tillis, the senator from North Carolina, said to us he'd like for Congress to provide some certainty by voting now on aid and then come back after the election to do more.\n\nLawmakers aren't scheduled to come back for another month. Why do you think it can wait?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON (R-Louisiana): Well, it can wait because remember, the day before Hurricane Helene hit \u2013 made landfall in Florida, and then went up through the states and wound up in Senator Tillis' state of North Carolina, Congress appropriated $20 billion additional to FEMA so that they would have the necessary resources to address immediate needs.\n\nAnd so we put that into the coffers. I just checked, Margaret. As of this morning, less than 2 percent of that funding has actually been distributed, right around 2 percent of it. So we need FEMA to do its job. That \u2013 those funds, that money is provided so that storm victims can have the immediate necessities met.\n\nAnd then what happens after every storm is that the states have to assess and calculate the actual needs, and then they submit to Congress that request. As soon as that is done, Congress will meet and, in bipartisan fashion, we will address those needs. We'll provide the additional resources.\n\nBut it would be premature to call everyone back now, because this \u2013 these storms are so large in their scope and magnitude, it's going to take a little bit of time to make those calculations.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the FEMA director says there's only $11 billion left from that $20 billion that was allocated. So, that's a different accounting than this 2 percent you say was distributed.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: Yes.\n\nSo they've obligated some funds, but they've only distributed 2 percent. The rescue and recovery effort is still going on, and then we address the rest of it.\n\nBut FEMA was slow to respond. They did not do the job that we all expect and hope that they will do. And there's going to be a lot of assessment about that as well in the days ahead.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But hurricane season, as you know, lasts through the end of November. You're from Louisiana. You've dealt with this before.\n\nNOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, is forecasting this could be one of the busiest seasons on record. So \u2013 so, why not get ahead of this? Isn't it a bit of a gamble to wait?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: No, it's not.\n\nMargaret, as I just said, Congress can't meet and just send money on a guess or an estimate of what the damages are. The way supplemental disaster funding is provided is that, you know, the state sends in actual needs. It's assessed by Congress and then handed out that way.\n\nBut, again, remember, they have billions, tens of billions of dollars that were already sent to FEMA\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: \u2026 one day before Helene made landfall. So they \u2013 they have plenty of resources.\n\nAnd, in fact, the administration Secretary Mayorkas said himself, DHS \u2013 FEMA is a division \u2013 a division of Homeland Security \u2013 he said just a few days ago on his telecast to the media that they have what they need right now.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And that $100 billion is a correct assessment that you made?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: Well, look, that's my guesstimate.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: OK.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: But, you know, I \u2013 I was on the ground in the worst-hit areas in Florida. I went where Helene made landfall. Whole communities are wiped out there. It's devastating. It goes all the way inland. The agricultural areas are devastated by it as well.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: And then you go up to the Carolinas, Tennessee, Georgia, it is a broad scope.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You are the speaker of the House, which means you are one of the officials with some say about the security situation leading up to January 6 and election certification.\n\nCan you assure the country we will not see the violence that this country experienced in 2021? What are you doing to stop it?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: Yes, I don't think we'll see anything like that.\n\nI certainly pray and hope that's true. There's a lot of great work that's been done at the federal, state and local level to prevent the chaos that ensued after 2020, the COVID election year, when all the states were changing their laws and regulations without the legislatures approving that.\n\nThat brought up constitutional questions. There were all sorts of concerns about fraud and irregularity and all those things. The \u2013 the good thing is \u2013 and I think everybody should be encouraged that, since that time, most of the state legislatures went to work to shore up their systems to ensure that those kinds of things didn't happen in the future.\n\nAnd I think that that's going to give us a high degree of certainty, and certainly hope that this will be a free and fair and legal election. Congress will follow the Constitution. I can guarantee you that. I have made a career of that.\n\nYou know, I have demonstrated it over and over and over throughout my life and as speaker of the House. And we will take care of this. So, everybody can \u2013 can have a sense of certainty about that.\n\nNow look, there \u2013 there are members on both sides of the aisle who may object to slates of electors. That is commonplace now. In fact, Democrats have objected to slates of electors after every single Republican presidential victory this century.\n\nSo there's nothing really irregular about that. And when people say that they've got to watch it closely, they're saying that they'll do their job. So\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But back in\u2026\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: We're going to have the peaceful transition of power. Yes, I believe President Trump's going to win, and this will be taken care of.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But, back in 2020, you supported a legal challenge to the outcome of the election.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The Supreme Court rejected that attempt to challenge it. Since then, the Electoral Count Reform Act has been passed.\n\nAre you certain that, at the nation's Capitol, the lawmakers who you work with won't be challenging the outcome?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: Look, we'll see what happens. I can just tell you that we're going to follow the law, and we will ensure that our colleagues follow the law the Electoral Count Act and the Constitution itself requires.\n\nThe reason for the objection in, you know, the last election cycle, in 2020, was what I referenced earlier, is that we had all sorts of changes to election laws in the states, and choosing electors, the mechanism by doing that under Article 2, Section 1, Clause 2, says that only the state legislatures can choose those systems.\n\nSo, when elections officials and secretaries of state and some state court judges and whomever, the governors, when they changed their rules because of COVID, they did it in an unconstitutional manner. And that was an important legal question. The Supreme Court never addressed it, because, remember, they just rejected all that on standing.\n\nBut we're not relitigating what happened in 2020.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and 62 legal \u2013 no, I'm not. But 60\u2026\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: No, we're talking about 2024 and\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Exactly. And 62 legal challenges, as you know, failed with the Trump challenges to the outcome.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: Yes, but not on that basis. Margaret, Margaret, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Not on that basis. That legal question is, I think, objectively proven to be true.\n\nObviously, everyone knows the legislatures weren't meeting in 2020 because of COVID. So it's Article 2, Section 1, Clause 2. Everybody, Google it and read. It says only the legislatures can make those rules.\n\nBut, look, I'm confident I can tell you, I think, this year\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But on the security picture\u2026\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: \u2026 that's not an issue, right?\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: On the security picture at the nation's Capitol, what measures are you taking?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: Yes.\n\nLook, we have an all-hands-on-deck approach on this. The Capitol Police and the architect of the Capitol and everyone have done extraordinary measures. They've hardened the facilities around the building to prevent anything in the future from foreign terrorists or anyone else who might want to, you know, try to invade the Capitol, OK?\n\nThat's taken care of. But I think the greater issue and the bigger story is that you've had really great work done in most of the states to shore up their systems and to make sure that we have a free and fair election.\n\nNow, look, as President Trump says all the time, and I agree, our side, what we say at the rallies, you've heard, is, we've got to make it too big to rig. I think that's really important. I think there is going to be some cheating in this election. I think noncitizens are going to vote.\n\nLook, case in point\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You know that it is against the law\u2026\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: \u2026 Glenn Youngkin, the governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 for noncitizens to vote in federal elections. That's established law.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: Of course it is. Of course it is, but \u2013 of course it is, but here's the problem.\n\nThere's a number of states that are not requiring proof of citizenship when illegals or noncitizens register to vote. We know that's happening.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But, respectfully, Speaker, you\u2026\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: We want \u2013 everybody should want the law to be followed\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Absolutely.\n\nRespectfully, Speaker, you both, in the course of this interview, said that you do believe that states have taken measures that will help the integrity of this election\u2026\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: That's true.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 and then you just also seemed to undermine confidence in the integrity of the state elections.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: No, no. Margaret, hold on. Wait a minute. Wait. Wait just a minute. It's not me undermining it. It's the actions of the Biden/Harris administration and some of these states.\n\nNoncitizens are not allowed to vote under federal law.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, if your issue is with certain governors, shouldn't you be talking to them?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: We have been. We have been. And the Republican governors have done heroic work. They've done their own audits of the \u2013 their voter rolls to try to ensure and do their best duty to make sure that this we \u2013 this is a free, fair and legal election.\n\nWe're calling on all the governors to do the same thing, Democrat governors as well. And Democrat-led states in the legislatures, they need to do the same thing. A lot of good work has been done since 2020, but there are still questions out there.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, thank you for your time.\n\nWe'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us.\n\n(End VT)\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Florida Democratic Congressman Maxwell Frost. He joins us from Orlando.\n\nWelcome to Face the Nation.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MAXWELL FROST (D-Florida): Thanks for having me on.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, President Biden is in Florida today to assess damage from Hurricane Milton. At least 60 Democratic lawmakers, some from Florida, have called for Congress to immediately return to Washington to vote for aid.\n\nYou haven't joined that call. Why?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MAXWELL FROST: I believe I have joined that call. But \u2013 but, if not, I do believe that Congress needs to return to make sure that we pass money for more aid.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But how immediately do you need that to happen? How in need is your community?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MAXWELL FROST: Our community's very much in need across Florida.\n\nBut the thing we have to understand is, yes, FEMA has the resources necessary to deal with the current situation, but like was mentioned in the previous segment, NOAA is predicting and we've seen that this is one of the worst hurricane seasons we've seen. And we're not done with this hurricane season.\n\nIt doesn't end really until the end of November. And so I think it is important. Why leave up to chance when we can ensure that FEMA has the resources it needs, and not just FEMA. SBA also has a program, and different agencies have programs that help us to respond to these hurricanes.\n\nWhy would we leave it up to chance and wait until something happens, when we can make sure that we do that work now, especially when a lot of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are working at politicizing these storms, when we can actually do something about it?\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, you need this vote to happen before Congress is set to return November 12, or you can wait until November 12?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MAXWELL FROST: I think we should do it as soon as possible. Why wait until November 12? We don't know what's going to be happening in terms of natural disasters or storms.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MAXWELL FROST: I think it's important that a agency like FEMA have even\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: OK.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MAXWELL FROST: \u2026 not just what they need, but even more than what they need to ensure that they have\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I\u2026\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MAXWELL FROST: \u2026 the resources necessary, of course, to help with the current operation\u2026\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I have got to\u2026\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MAXWELL FROST: \u2026 which they have but also with future things.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 take a break here, Congressman, and continue our conversation on the other side of the commercial.\n\nStay with us.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation.\n\nWe return to our conversation with Florida Congressman Maxwell Frost.\n\nCongressman, you are the youngest member of Congress, it looks like, and you've been on college campuses trying to shore up support for Vice President Harris. In our CBS polling from earlier this summer, before Harris entered the race, we did see, among 40 percent of young people who responded, they said politics over the last few years makes them feel like there's nothing else they can do. Another 40 percent said they want to tune out and watch something else.\n\nYoung people may not be apathetic, but they certainly don't seem to be excited about the political system as a way to effect change. How do you change that?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MAXWELL FROST: Well, I appreciate the question.\n\nAnd it's not just up to me, right? It's up to all of our leaders, all of our organizers, people on the ground to make sure that young people understand that, if they step away from their civic power that they have, there's people who don't have their best interests at heart that are more than happy to step into that power for them.\n\nI mean, you mentioned, you know, a number that comes before Kamala Harris being the top of our ticket. I have seen, as I have traveled this country - - did a back-to-school tour just a few weeks ago \u2013 a lot of enthusiasm and excitement around this election, especially with young voters wanting to vote for Kamala Harris.\n\nAnd, you know, there's this notion that young people are not being involved in the political system. And we can do better, but people should know that young people are voting at the highest numbers in our country's history. 2020 was the highest youth voter turnout in the history of our country. 2018 and 2022 \u2013 2022 are the highest youth voter turnout in a midterm in the history of our country too.\n\nSo we're really \u2013 we're trending in the right direction. We just need to continue to reach out to young people, not take those votes for granted.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right. And there's that question of enthusiasm actually translating to votes. You've said vibes don't mean votes, I saw you say.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MAXWELL FROST: Mm-hmm. Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: On another issue that we know is of concern to the Harris campaign, I want to ask you about remarks that Former President Barack Obama made earlier this week.\n\nHe was speaking to campaign volunteers in Pittsburgh, and he raised the concern about low enthusiasm and turnout specifically among black men. He said \u2013 quote \u2013 \"Part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president.\"\n\nDo you share the former president's concern that this is a dynamic impacting the race? How much of an issue is it for Vice President Harris?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MAXWELL FROST: I think it is an issue with a lot of different voters across this country.\n\nAnd it's something that our country \u2013 you know, we've come a long way, as \u2013 in terms of women's suffrage. We've come a long way in terms of making sure of equity in this country.\n\nBut there's still a lot of this bigotry in this country in terms of sexism, in terms of racism. And we still have to work at getting over that. Those things are still here. They still exist in a lot of communities. And we still have a lot of work to do here.\n\nAnd so I think President Obama was just having some very serious, tough talk, right, tough love, with a lot of \u2013 especially \u2013 he was speaking directly to young black voters, young black men specifically, and making sure that they understand, look, sometimes you have to take a step back and look at your own bias.\n\nWhat's the bias you have? What are the real reasons you're voting against someone or for someone? Is it a legitimate policy thing, or does it have to do more with the vibe of something And then look more into that as well. I think it's really important.\n\nThis, like, politics of vibes, we see it a lot here in Florida with someone like Ron DeSantis, who claims to be someone who's for the people and for democracy, yet, every chance he gets, he acts like an authoritarian.\n\nThen I go to voters who have family members who have escaped countries with authoritarian leaders, and I ask them, why are you voting for someone who's emulating what your parents escaped, and they can't quite explain it. It has to do with the vibes, with the atmosphere the politician has created.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MAXWELL FROST: And I think we still have to contend with that as a country. And that's what the president was talking about.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, thank you for sharing your insights. We're going to have to leave it there for today.\n\nWe'll be right back.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: For more on the race for the White House and our latest poll, we're joined now by CBS News executive director of elections and surveys Anthony Salvanto.\n\nAnthony, the polling show's an already close race has tightened further. Why is that?\n\nANTHONY SALVANTO: Let me start by reminding people just how tight this is.\n\nWhen you look at our estimates across each and every one of the battleground states, one after another is effectively even. So it's a race that either candidate can and may win.\n\nBut one reason I think this week was highlighted is that you see how differently these candidates and their supporters define what is, not just what ought to be going forward.\n\nLet me show you a couple of different examples. Start with the debate over hurricane relief. Trump supporters say that they believe hurricane relief is not going to people impacted by the hurricane. In fact, they accept the claim that FEMA money was diverted to people in the country illegally.\n\nAnd Harris voters say speed of FEMA was just about right and that aid is going to people impacted. But that's just one example.\n\nTake another, the economy. Harris voters say that the economy is largely good. They say or are more likely to say that the stock market is up this year, that the U.S. has been adding jobs, Trump voters much less likely to say those things.\n\nAnd one more example, the border. Harris voters say that crossings of the border, the U.S. and Mexico border, are down. Trump voters say that crossings are up.\n\nSo what that does is, it all underpins this idea it's not just competing ideologies going forward. It's different views of what is right now in the country.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: There's no agreed-upon set of facts\u2026\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nANTHONY SALVANTO: Exactly.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 on things that are measurable, arguably.\n\nSo, if they get their information differently, who do these individuals trust to provide it to them?\n\nANTHONY SALVANTO: We started by asking people how much they use social media. And both camps, both Trump and Harris voters, do use it. They don't necessarily trust everything they see on it.\n\nBut one thing they say is that they feel social media makes it easier for them to find people that they agree with. And that's a reminder to everyone, when we look at the role of information, it's not just that people are maybe getting right or wrong things or are steered in different direction. It's that sometimes they very affirmatively go out and look for things that reinforce existing beliefs.\n\nThe other part is, look at sources of information. For Trump voters, Donald Trump is a trusted source of information, as much as their family and friends and more than a lot of what's called experts. But they're not as trusting across the board of all those things, whereas Harris voters also trust Harris very much, but they also trust other sources, like the ones that I mentioned, across the board.\n\nOne thing we saw that both camps share is, they're concerned about foreign interference, that foreign countries are trying to influence them, the voters, to try to steer this election.\n\nAnd what tends to happen is, each camp thinks that Iran, China, Russia wants the other candidate to win this. Where all this comes out is, when you look ahead, what happens after the results are counted, Donald Trump's voters are more likely than Harris' to say that his camp should challenge the election if he loses.\n\nAnd they're more suspicious that there will be widespread fraud in this election. That's something, talk about different views of what is, that we need to keep an eye on once the race is over.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Interesting.\n\nAnthony Salvanto, thank you.\n\nANTHONY SALVANTO: Thank you.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We will be back in a moment.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We spoke late last week with a group of voters from all seven battleground states to discuss the election, their outlook for America's future and more.\n\n(Begin VT)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: How many of you voters are going to cast your ballots for Donald Trump?\n\n(SOME VOTERS RAISE THEIR HAND)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mary, you raised your hand. You are in the very important state of Arizona. What's driving your decision?\n\nMARY (Trump Supporter): Well, my decision is, I live right on the border in Yuma, Arizona.\n\nAnd I know, in the last 3.5 years, we have had just horrible, horrible problems in Yuma with a lot of illegal immigration coming through. Our economy is awful. Yuma's unemployment is 16 percent.\n\nSo the economy is a big factor as well, just a combination of things. Our groceries have gone up. Just \u2013 just everything has just really gone downhill in the last 3.5 years for us in Yuma and Arizona completely.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Cole, you are in Georgia, also a very key state. Why do you plan to vote for Donald Trump?\n\nCOLE (Trump Supporter): For me, I do not look necessarily at the candidate specifically, but just the broader party and the direction they're hoping to take America.\n\nFor me, some of the top three issues would definitely be our economy, immigration, and then I would also say, as we have come out of the pandemic, just seeing how the two different political parties handled the pandemic.\n\nI think Kamala Harris and the Democrats are a little bit too extreme on the issue of abortion. I do not support the idea of allowing abortion at 20 weeks of pregnancy, and certainly not with no restrictions. And so I would prefer candidates who are more aligned with my pro-life position.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mike, you're in Nevada. You said you will be voting for Donald Trump, but he makes it hard. He makes it hard for you to feel good about that vote.\n\nCan you explain what you mean?\n\nMIKE (Trump Supporter): There's parts of Donald Trump which I admire and parts of Donald Trump which I cringe, for lack of a better term.\n\nAnd in the debate, when he said \u2013 they just asked him, January 6, would you change anything, I think he had an opportunity there to step up as a leader and take some ownership. People went to jail. I think \u2013 I think that would have showed a lot of courage for him to do that.\n\nSo, I like things on the economy, tightening up inflation, yes, yes, and yes. I think those are the primary issues in this election. You know, as you get into the periphery and just how he conducts himself sometimes, it's \u2013 you know, it's hard to put a Trump sign in the front yard based on some of his behaviors.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But you're still doing it. Why?\n\nMIKE: Well, because I'm a fan of the economy and a fan of success, right? I think there's been \u2013 there has been no driver in the driver's seat in our economy for the last 3.5 years.\n\nAnd I think we have suffered mightily for it. That drives a lot for me. I don't have to like people personally. I don't have to agree with some of the stuff they do, but I have to kind of go for the greater good.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Christopher, you are in North Carolina. How are people doing there amidst the fallout from this storm? And what makes you an enthusiastic Republican right now?\n\nCHRISTOPHER (Trump Supporter): I have always been enthusiastic Republican since I voted for Ronald Reagan in 1980.\n\nI have been fortunate enough to be part of Trump's ground campaign in 2016. And I met some very amazing people. I really, really like the maturation process that he's gone through. He got his feet wet in 2016. He learned the hard way. He got tagged a few times. He stepped in it a lot.\n\nIt's easy to look in the rearview mirror and say coulda, shoulda, and woulda. But when you're in the moment, you make the best decision you can at the time. I trust him to do that. I trust him to make a decision.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But do you, Christopher, ever feel uncomfortable, like Mike said he did, with things that Donald Trump says?\n\nCHRISTOPHER: At some times, I have.\n\nBut in this day and age, with the \u2013 what we're being faced with the \u2013 on the global stage and the not-so-nice characters that will look for a weak spot in the United States of America to bring her to her knees, I'd rather have in a \u2013 in the ocean full of bloody water shark \u2013 great white sharks, I'd rather have an orca in there than Flipper protecting me.\n\nAnd I know Donald Trump will get in there and he will fight for us. He may not say what we want to hear, but he will execute on our behalf. And it's obvious. The man nearly \u2013 nearly died.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.\n\nCHRISTOPHER: He took a bullet for us and he got back up again. And you cannot dismiss that. And his instinct was to say, fight.\n\nSo, that right there tells me this man doesn't \u2013 he doesn't have to be there.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: How many of you are planning to vote for Vice President Harris in November?\n\n(SOME VOTERS RAISE THEIR HAND)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to dive into exactly why that is.\n\nLynda and then Kathy, why are you supporting Vice President Harris for president?\n\nLYNDA (Harris Supporter): I first voted for Reagan in '80 as well. And all of my voting years, I was told character counts.\n\nAnd as I look at Donald Trump, I either have to say character counts and not vote for him or say it doesn't count anymore. I did vote for him in 2016. I voted for Joe Biden in 2020. And I will vote for Kamala Harris this year.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That's interesting that you voted for Trump, then Biden. Now you're going to vote for Harris. These are very different people.\n\nWhat is driving your decision now?\n\nLYNDA: I have listened to Kamala Harris and the things she has to say. I truly believe she cares about people. I think her life shows she cares about people. And she truly wants to work to make our day-in-and-day-out lives better now.\n\nAnd I care about now, but I have grandchildren, and I care about what kind of a world we're going to give them to build on as they become people to vote in the next few years. And, again, I go back to character counts. And Donald Trump is a proven liar. He has said and done too many things that I think should be disqualifying, from January 6 to those poor people in Springfield, Ohio.\n\nThey must just be terrified.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Kathy, you're in Pennsylvania. Why are you voting for Vice President Harris?\n\nKATHY (Harris Supporter): I hear and see the fears that people have just contemplating another four years with Donald Trump.\n\nI don't have anything that I can think of that I would say I agree with him on. And I, like Lynda, would say, to me, character counts. So Donald Trump is a no for me.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: What about you, Mauricio? You are joining us from Wisconsin.\n\nMAURICIO (Harris Supporter): January 6, to me, is beyond unacceptable. That's sacred territory that was stormed. He riled up that \u2013 it was not a protest. That was an insurrection.\n\nThe plans were to overthrow a legitimate election. That will never be tolerated, in my viewpoint.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Do you believe that Vice President Harris, if she is elected president, that she will be very different from Joe Biden? Or do you see her continuing the issues and agenda that he has pursued for the past four years?\n\nMAURICIO: I'm sure she's probably a little bit more liberal. But she would accept the results if she lost. And that's big to me.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Lynda, back to the original question I asked Mauricio as well.\n\nAs a Harris supporter, do you believe that the vice president would continue Joe Biden's policies? Or do you think she has a different vision for the country?\n\nLYNDA: I think she will do some of the things President Biden has done. And some of the things Biden has done has helped our country quite a bit.\n\nI would like to hear more specifics of what she plans to do, but I would rather see someone want to give tax breaks to the middle class than the most wealthy people in our country, which is what Trump wants to do.\n\nCOLE: I just wanted to follow up on this idea of how a President \u2013 a future President Harris might or may not be different than President Biden.\n\nAnd I will be honest with you. I do not envy Kamala Harris, because she has to defend President Biden, and she also has to kind of thread the needle of following his policies, maybe making some of her own.\n\nWell, listen, there have been some failures in this administration. And I think whether you're on the left or the right, you can hopefully see that. And, for me, some of those \u2013 those things off the top of my head were, we did not have a good withdrawal from Afghanistan, prices are through the roof for consumers. And we can debate how we got at that.\n\nBut at the end of the day, inflation is out of control. And there have been a record number of illegal border crossings under the Biden administration. And so I understand that she has to appeal to the base and she doesn't want to alienate any Biden voters.\n\nBut it's very shocking to me that there's not one thing that she could think of that she would have done differently than President Biden.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Show of hands, who is concerned about the issue of abortion and reproductive health care going into this election?\n\n(SOME VOTERS RAISE THEIR HAND)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: OK.\n\nMary, you're not raising your hand. You live in a state where abortion access is currently permitted up to 15 weeks. You're good with that, where it is? It's not a motivating factor for you, even though abortion will be on the ballot in Arizona?\n\nMARY: The way I feel is that I'm more concerned about women's health. And I think that we need to concentrate on prevention, prevention of unplanned pregnancies, not using abortion as birth control.\n\nThat's the way I feel. I'm a mother and a grandmother, and I think that that's what it should be. I think 17 weeks is a good amount of time. Now, of course, just like everyone else had said, rape, incest, problems with the pregnancy, things like that, of course, I can understand having an abortion, and you find out later in your pregnancy that something's wrong with the baby.\n\nOK, that's a different story.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Would you, Mary, like to hear candidate Donald Trump and candidate J.D. Vance echo your beliefs? They avoid talking about the specifics.\n\nYou were very specific at 17 weeks. Would you like the candidates to be that specific?\n\nMARY: At the federal level, and the reason why it was brought back to the states, is that different states have different feelings.\n\nCalifornia is much more liberal than Arizona or Texas or Oklahoma or Georgia or other areas of the country. And just like Trump said, look at Kansas. Kansas has become more liberal than they used to be. And that's very true.\n\nBut I \u2013 the main focus is women's health. Women and what's taught in schools, nothing anymore.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Kathy, you raised your hand that this is an issue that's important to you.\n\nKATHY: It is. I have daughters and granddaughters. And I would hope that the decisions of something that serious would be allowed to be made by them and their health care provider, not by someone sitting in a \u2013 on a bench or in a boardroom or wherever making that decision for them to be able to or not to be able to control their own body.\n\nAnd it's not realistic to believe, if you like this liberal law better, you \u2013 everyone can just move where they want to. Those things just aren't realistic.\n\n(End VT)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You can see the extended interview on our YouTube page or our Web site.\n\nWe will be right back.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you all for watching.\n\nUntil next week, for Face the Nation, I'm Margaret Brennan.",

        "text": "US presidential election 2024: Who has the better track record for Israel? - opinion\nThe US presidential election is less than a month away. The campaigns are in full swing with accusations hurled back and forth. The voters are hopefully thoughtfully evaluating what each candidate brings to the table and not just voting along knee-jerk party lines or wishful thinking. For some of the electorate, a looming question is: what should one who is concerned about Israel take into consideration as they decide for whom to cast their vote?\n\nObviously, in the heat of the campaign, promises are made and candidates say what they think the electorate wants to hear. Thankfully, in this campaign, the voter actually has more to go on than just election rhetoric. Trump served four years as president and Harris served as a senator and vice president, so both have records. These records include votes, statements, appointments, etc. It behooves the interested voter to scrutinize the records in an effort to assess who would likely be the more positive president from an Israeli perspective.\n\nThere are certainly many other issues that are important to people, and these two candidates have records on those issues as well. Furthermore, regarding these two candidates in particular, they are attacked for non-policy weak points, whether it is Trump\u2019s legal issues, January 6, and immigrants eating pets, or Harris flipping on every position, messing up the border issue, being complicit in covering up President Biden\u2019s cognitive decline, and being the lowest-rated VP in recent history partially because of her 92% staff turnover.\n\nPersonality also plays a role \u2013 to many voters, neither of these candidates has charisma or is likeable. However, as a person for whom Israel is of central importance, one needs to put all else aside and let the record speak. So what is the record?\n\nIN 2019, the Senate considered a bill called the Strengthening America\u2019s Security in the Middle East Act. Among its goals were to authorize the appropriation of funds to Israel and to allow state or local governments to adopt measures to divest assets from entities that boycott the Jewish state. Obviously, isolationist Republican Rand Paul and anti-Israel Democrat Bernie Sanders voted against it. But it passed with strong bipartisan support by a vote of 77-23. Senator Kamala Harris, rated at the time as the second most liberal senator, voted against it. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL nominee and former US president Donald Trump speaks at an event commemorating the first anniversary of the October 7 Hamas attacks on Israel on Monday in Doral, Florida. (credit: MARCO BELLO/REUTERS)\n\nRegarding one of her last acts as a senator before becoming VP, in January 2020 Senator Harris proudly tweeted \u201cYesterday my colleagues and I introduced the No War Against Iran Act\u2026.\u201d She seems not to recognize the Iranian threat. Nor does she recognize other bad guys, as she voted in 2019 in favor of the Bernie Sanders-sponsored S. J. Res. (Senate Joint Resolution) 7 that directed the removal of United States Armed Forces from hostilities in the Republic of Yemen. Similarly, in 2018 she tweeted a criticism of a US strike in Syria that was in retaliation for Bashar Assad\u2019s use of chemical weapons.\n\nNot a good look\n\nAmbassador David Friedman was likely the US ambassador with the warmest relationship with Israel and its people: Sen. Harris voted against his appointment.\n\nAccording to a 2020 report by the Washington Beacon, \u201cas California\u2019s attorney-general and then as US senator, Harris forged a relationship with CAIR,\u201d the Council on American-Islamic Relations, an organization that is unabashedly anti-Israel. In 2021-2022, VP Harris received a 100% rating from CAIR, and in 2018 and 2020, as senator, another 100% rating from the National Iranian American Council (NIAC), which some see as Iran\u2019s de facto lobby in the West.\n\nIn her current role as VP, Harris\u2019s recent appointments include Brenda Abdelall, an American attorney of Egyptian descent, a woman who previously said: \u201cZionists control much of American politics.\u201d This follows on the heels of the appointment of Nasrina Bargzie, who has called Jewish college students\u2019 complaints about antisemitism \u201clegal bullying.\u201d\n\nAnd maybe most concerning is Harris\u2019s \u201cJewish liaison,\u201d Israeli-born Ilan Goldberg, who in previous positions supported the Iran deal, supported Obama\u2019s parting anti-Israel UN resolution, opposed moving the embassy to Jerusalem, opposed the Taylor Force Act, worked in the Biden-Harris administration to impose the \u201cs\u201d of BDS: essentially always being on the anti-Israel side of issues.

This has occurred 301 times since 1789; Harris, in less than four years, has cast over 10% of them, thus being an active participant in that congressional body. Yet when the prime minister of America\u2019s closest ally addressed Congress, Harris boycotted Netanyahu\u2019s wartime speech.\n\nTHE BIDEN/HARRIS administration has released billions of dollars to Iran, including billions even after October 7. And Harris has promised to bring back an Iran nuclear deal. In the meantime, this administration has withheld shipments of arms in the middle of a war that actually slowed down Israeli offenses, capriciously sanctioned Israeli Jewish citizens (acting as if Israel has no justice system of its own), and threatened to sanction an Israel army unit and ministers of the democratically elected Israeli government.\n\nQuite ironic in light of the fact that in response to Israel\u2019s decision to ban the entry of outspoken antisemites, the squad members Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, then-senator Harris criticized the decision, tweeting: \u201cI don\u2019t believe any nation should deny entry to elected Members of Congress, period.\u201d\n\nHarris consistently mentions Gaza suffering whenever claiming to support Israel. As early as December, she said that \u201cour ally needed to do more\u201d to protect Gazan civilians, saying in a Dubai speech: \u201cThe United States is unequivocal; international humanitarian law must be respected. Too many innocent Palestinians have been killed.\u201d The libelous implications are that Israel is violating international law and that the blame for Gazan suffering and the responsibility for alleviating it lies with Israel and not Hamas.\n\nHer position is not new; famously, in Sept 2021 while visiting George Mason University, a student said Israel was committing \u201cethnic genocide\u201d and VP Harris, rather than correct the confused student, lauded her for voicing \u201cher truth\u201d!\n\nA lot in a little time\n\nON THE other hand, while the Trump record might seem shorter, it contains some quite significant, even astounding, accomplishments. After successive administrations stalled in carrying out the congressional mandate, Trump finally moved the US embassy to Jerusalem. He recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. His administration succeeded in negotiating the Abraham Accords, a peace treaty between Israel and four Arab nations that has resulted in a warm peace.\n\nAnd he reversed a long-standing injustice and enabled my son to receive the first officially-sanctioned US passport in which an American citizen born in Jerusalem was able to declare his place of birth as \u201cIsrael\u201d. He surrounded himself with morally conscious advisers such as secretary of state Mike Pompeo and UN ambassador Nikki Haley.\n\nTRUMP ALSO strove to harm the bad guys: He exited JCPOA \u2013 the Iran nuclear deal \u2013 and placed sanctions on the Islamic Republic, halted funding for the PA\u2019s \u201cpay to slay\u201d policy, halted support of UNRWA (an organization that has now been conclusively shown for all to see as a harborer of terrorists), and left the hypocritical UN Human Rights Council. The Biden/Harris administration reversed most of those funding decisions, thereby restoring funds to terror supporters.\n\nUnder the Trump administration, the Houthis were placed on the US terrorist list. In Feb 2021, in one of their first acts, the Biden/Harris administration reversed that. Despite the fact that in January 2022 the UN Security Council reiterated that the Houthis were engaging in terrorism, the Biden/Harris administration stuck by their immoral decision.\n\nFinally, after a surge in Houthi terror acts, in January 2024 the administration had no choice but to essentially admit that the Trump administration was correct and returned the Houthis to the official list of terrorists.\n\nWhile obviously, past performance is no guarantee of future results, they do give an indication of likely policies. It has become clear that it can no longer be taken for granted that the United States will unquestionably support Israel \u2013 and this election is crucial for the future of US-Israel relations.\n\nIt is of great significance for those of us privileged to live in the Holy Land. If one candidate surrounds themselves with advisers who know right from wrong and the other with anti-Israel advisers, if one removes support from terrorist organizations while the other increases support for terrorist organizations, and if one provides for Israeli needs while the other withholds them, it seems that voters who care about Israel should look at this record.\n\nThe writer is a professor of neuroscience at Bar-Ilan University.",

If you're a U.S. citizen, dual-national, and will be 18 on November 5, 2024, you have the right to vote from abroad in US elections \u2014 including in the November 2024 elections! As a U.S. citizen, you can register to vote from abroad while living, working, or traveling overseas by submitting one form \u2014 the Federal Post Card Application (FPCA). It doesn't matter if you were registered to vote before you left the U.S., how long you\u2019ve lived outside the U.S., or if you've never resided in the U.S. at all. You have the right to vote!\n\nIf you have any voting questions or concerns, including postal mailing your ballot, please email info-sweden@democratsabroad. org right away.\n\nAmerikanska medborgare (inklusive de med dubbelt medborgarskap) har r\u00f6str\u00e4tt i allm\u00e4nna val oavsett var i v\u00e4rlden man bor.

The U.S. State Department recommends, \u201call U.S. citizens living abroad complete and submit a new Federal Post Card Application (FPCA) annually, to ensure you remain on your state\u2019s voter rolls and to ensure your local election office has your up-to-date contact information.\u201dprovides all the information, forms, and support help in one place to make voting easy!\n\nKEY POINTS FOR VOTING Request your overseas ballot now! www.VoteFromAbroad.org\n\nAsk on the request form (FPCA) that your ballot be sent to you by email\n\nSubmit your request form by email, if your state allows\n\nReturn your voted ballot electronically (email, upload or fax), if your state allows\n\nIf your state requires you to mail back your ballot: Request your ballot NOW, so you\u2019ll receive it on Sept 21 when states start sending overseas ballots out (45 days before the election) Download and vote your ballot as soon as you receive it Use the diplomatic pouch (by Oct 2nd) or use a courier service to sent it back\n\nTrack your request form and your ballot\n\nQuestions?

Registering to vote and requesting your ballot\n\nThe first step is to request your ballot, and if need be, register to vote from abroad. You should do this every election year to ensure you remain on your state\u2019s overseas voter rolls and to ensure your local election office has your up-to-date contact information. It\u2019s important to register as an absentee voter from abroad because the ballots of US citizens voting from abroad have special protections and are different from the standard absentee ballot.\n\nGo to www.VoteFromAbroad.org to fill out your Federal Post Card Application (FPCA) absentee ballot request \u2014 it takes 5-10 minutes! If you're not registered to vote, the FPCA also serves as a voter registration form. Choose the option to receive ballots by email.\n\nThe second step is to submit the FPCA absentee ballot request form to your local election office in the United States. Most states allow you to submit your FPCA directly from www.VoteFromAbroad.org without the need to print it out. But some states require that you submit your completed form by email attachment, fax, or postal mail. State deadlines and submission methods can be found here.\n\nIf you have any questions while filling out your request form, go to the Vote from Abroad FAQ Section or type your question in the website's chat box (red circle in the bottom right-hand corner of each screen). Or you can email us at [email protected]\n\n\n\n2. Confirming your request has been accepted \u2705\n\nAfter submitting your FPCA absentee ballot request form, call or email your Local Election Official (LEO) to confirm they have received it and will be sending your ballot. Your LEO's contact information is listed in the instructions generated when you fill out your FPCA form at Vote from Abroad. You can also look up their contact info here.\n\nMost states provide a website where you can verify your voter status. To find your state's website, click here and scroll down to \u201cWhere Is My Ballot?\"\n\n3. Receiving your ballot \ud83d\udcec\n\nYour overseas absentee ballot is not your standard absentee ballot back home! Thanks to the MOVE Act, all states must send FPCA-requested absentee ballots to overseas voters no later than 45 days before a federal election \u2014 this year that\u2019s September 21, 2024.\n\nAnd, if requested, all states must send overseas voters their ballot by email.\n\nYou don't need to wait for ballots to arrive on September 21. If you're worried your ballot won't arrive in time for you to return it by the deadline, send in a Backup Ballot NOW. The Backup Ballot (Federal Write-in Absentee Ballot or FWAB) is specifically for overseas voters who are concerned they won't receive their official ballot in time to return it by the deadline. All details about the Backup Ballot can be found here.\n\n4. Your ballot hasn\u2019t arrived? \ud83d\udced\n\nCheck your spam folder. Still no ballot? Contact your local election official here and confirm they\u2019ve sent your ballot to you. Go to www.VoteFromAbroad.org if you need to send in a new FPCA absentee ballot request form.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t received your ballot by October 1 and your state requires postal mail return, we recommend you send in a Backup Ballot to make sure your vote gets to your state in time. All details about the Backup Ballot can be found here.\n\n5. Voting your ballot \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f\n\nIt\u2019s easy to get informed about candidates, ballot initiatives, and judicial candidates and important to vote your ballot completely. State and local races are critical!\n\nThe simplest way is to vote for Democrats straight down the ballot. Some elected positions do not list a party affiliation, like school boards, judges, and others. To determine who to vote for in those cases, you can do the following:\n\nGoogle your county's local Democratic Party\n\nBlue Voter Guide Go to the\n\nGo to the League of Women Voters personalized ballot service\n\nGo to Ballotpedia - Choose your state\n\nGoogle the candidate's name to find their campaign website\n\n6. There are lots of ways to return your ballot!\n\n\ud83d\udccc Remember! Only use a mail service if you cannot return your ballot electronically\n\n\n\nBallot return methods \u2013 by email, online, postal mail, fax \u2013 vary by state. Always return your ballot as quickly as possible, but especially if your state only allows postal mail return. Always read the instructions that came with your ballot carefully! Find your state's ballot return methods here.\n\nIf your state allows email, online upload or fax for ballot return, please use these options as they\u2019re not subject to loss or delay! Here is more information on fax submission.\n\n\ud83d\udccc UPDATE: AS OF OCT 30, 2024: DO NOT USE THE FVAP FAX SERVICE!\n\nFVAP CAN'T GUARANTEE THAT FAXES WILL BE SUBMITTED BY THE NOV 5 ELECTION DEADLINE.\n\nNeed help scanning your ballot? Watch this video on how to scan using your smartphone. If you don't have a scanning app on your phone, you can use Adobe Scan mobile app for iPhone & Android New Jersey Voters: Please note that New Jersey allows for email or fax returns, but requires that the ballot ALSO be sent by postal mail.\n\n\n\nNew York Voters: Here are instructions on How to fold the New York State General Election ballot .\n\n\n\nIf your state requires postal mail return, see info below on options from Sweden.\n\n\ud83e\udc0a Courier Service:\n\nIf your state requires postal mail ballot return, the quickest option is to use a courier service like DHL, Federal Express, etc.\n\nEven with expedited courier services though, ballots still take several days to get to the United States. Please send your ballot as soon as possible! Do not wait! You should \u2013 and some states require you \u2013 ask for a postmark or date stamp to be placed on the outer envelope. Follow the instructions that came with your ballot. We do not recommend booking or paying online with any courier service. You will not receive a postmark if you book or pay online.\n\nCourier services cannot send to a P.O. Box! Be sure to confirm a street address with your local election official if a P.O. Box is the return address on your ballot.\n\n\n\n\ud83e\udc0a International Postal Service:\n\n\ud83d\udccc We no longer recommend using standard international post for Nov. 5th ballot return due to prolonged transit time. Instead, please use expedited post or a courier service (see above).\n\nIf your state requires postal mail ballot return, one option is to take your ballot to a post office and use international mail from PostNord. Please remember \u2014 mail service can be slow, write your return address on the back of your envelope, and send your ballot as soon as possible! If you have any voting questions or concerns, including problems postal mailing your ballot with PostNord, please contact us right away at: info-sweden@democratsabroad. org .\n\nWe do not recommend spending the extra money for a tracking number when sending the envelope since this can potentially slow down transit \u2013 it\u2019s better to confirm receipt by looking on your state\u2019s website, or looking up your local election officer's contact details here (scroll down to \"Find Your Election Office\"). Do not send it with a signature required as Local Elections Officers will not sign for it.\n\nAsk for a postmark or date stamp to be placed on the outer envelope. Some states require this, and it is a good practice in general. Always follow the instructions that came with your ballot carefully! Find out your state\u2019s requirements here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83e\udc0a The U.S. Embassy/Consulate diplomatic pouch:\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccc We no longer recommend using the diplomatic pouch at the Embassy for Nov. 5th ballot return due to prolonged transit time.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Sweden advised that transit time to the United States can take up to 20 days. The date has now PASSED (October 4) for which they advised ballots sent by the diplomatic post be dropped off (their voting website post HERE). Using this option going forward risks your ballot not arriving in time. If you do use the diplomatic pouch, you will need to place your ballot in a U.S. postage paid return envelope (usually provided with your ballot) or in an envelope bearing sufficient U.S. postage. You can download a free U.S. postage-paid return envelope template at FVAP.gov.\n\nUse a Back-up Ballot to make the deadline if your regular ballot hasn\u2019t arrived. Find out more here.\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Checking twice to prevent mistakes\n\n\n\nWhen filling out and packaging your ballot, don't forget to review the instructions carefully. Don't let human error spoil your ballot!\n\nRegardless of how you send in your ballot, remember that you \u2013 the voter \u2013 must be the one who places it \u201cin the mail.\u201d In some states, it is unlawful for any other person to handle your voted ballot, even if it is sealed. Need help? Contact us at: [email protected].\n\n8. Confirming your ballot's arrival at your local election office in the United States \u2713\u2713\n\nOnce you've sent your ballot, follow up with your local election official to make sure that it arrived and will be counted. Please do not just assume that your ballot has made it!\n\nNearly all states have online tracking services. The easiest way to ensure your ballot has arrived is to go to \"Track Your Ballot\" on your state\u2019s website. You can also look up your local election office's contact details here and contact them directly. They may be experiencing a high volume of calls, so you may need to be persistent to get through to someone.\n\n9. Having trouble? Need help? \ud83d\ude15\n\nWe understand that the voting process to some states can be confusing \u2014 that's why we're here to help!\n\n10.

        "text": "Trump vs. Harris: election effects on currency and crypto\nDollar movements during the campaign\n\nAs the US election approaches, the electoral campaign is already influencing the US dollar's trajectory. A few months back, we observed a strengthening of the Dollar Index before the debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Signs of fatigue and communication errors from Biden were multiplying, casting doubts on his chances against Trump.\n\nThe televised debate intensified these concerns, pressuring the Democratic camp. Less than a month later, Biden announced he would not seek re-election, leading to a decline in the dollar against major currencies in August.\n\nWhy is Trump associated with a strong dollar?\n\nTrump is linked to a strong dollar primarily because:\n\nHe advocates for tax cuts for US businesses and households, particularly the wealthiest, a theme from his 2016 and 2024 campaigns\n\nTax cuts boost consumption and economic activity but can also lead to inflation, which tends to drive up US interest rates and the dollar\n\nHis promotion of protectionist measures, such as increased trade tariffs on Chinese goods, is viewed as inflationary, raising the price of imports\n\nProtectionist measures can weaken foreign currencies, leading to a relative strengthening of the dollar.\n\nBut did the dollar actually strengthen during Trump's term?\n\nSurprisingly, no. From November 2016 to November 2020, the Dollar Index decreased by approximately 5%. Going further back to George W. Bush's presidency, the Dollar Index fell by about 25% over his two terms.",

        "text": "What is the US election impact on the Biotech sector\nInvesting.com -- The outcome of the 2024 U.S. presidential election is poised to affect the biotechnology sector, as both major parties present policy proposals that could reshape drug pricing, regulation, and research investment.\n\nAs per analysts at RBC Capital Markets, biotech companies face uncertainties as Democrats and Republicans outline their healthcare agendas.\n\nThe Democratic Party, led by Vice President Kamala Harris, has a more aggressive stance on drug pricing. Harris supports expanding the Inflation Reduction Act, which would allow Medicare to negotiate the prices of up to 50 drugs per year. This policy is likely to place pressure on companies heavily dependent on Medicare pricing.\n\nCompanies such as Gilead (NASDAQ:GILD), Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN), and Neurocrine (NASDAQ:NBIX) Biosciences, all of which have high exposure to the IRA, would likely face the most negative impact.\n\nAn expansion of pricing controls into commercial markets and a cap on out-of-pocket costs for generics could also compress profit margins across the sector.\n\nHowever, not all biotech firms would be adversely affected by a Democratic victory. The Harris administration\u2019s focus on mental health, women\u2019s health, and oncology could prove beneficial to companies developing treatments in these areas.\n\nMental health-focused firms like Intra-Cellular Therapies (NASDAQ:ITCI) and Axsome Therapeutics (NASDAQ:AXSM), as well as oncology firms such as Exelixis (NASDAQ:EXEL) and Nuvation Bio, stand to gain from expanded funding and access to care.\n\nAdditionally, the Biden administration\u2019s decision to protect orphan drugs used for rare diseases from IRA price negotiations means companies like BioMarin and Ultragenyx might avoid some pricing pressure.\n\nOn the other hand, a Republican-led government, likely under former President Donald Trump, would offer a more favorable environment for biotech firms.\n\nRepublicans are expected to take a more moderate approach to the IRA, potentially easing its implementation and reducing the pressure on companies exposed to Medicare.\n\nRBC analysts point out that this could provide a tailwind for companies like Regeneron and Neurocrine, which would benefit from slowed IRA-related discounting.\n\nMoreover, Trump\u2019s focus on chronic illnesses could boost companies developing treatments for such conditions, particularly for children. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX) and Jazz Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:JAZZ) are among the firms likely to benefit from initiatives aimed at improving care for chronic diseases.\n\nAdditionally, Republicans are seen as more favorable toward mergers and acquisitions, particularly if a less stringent Federal Trade Commission head is nominated, which could trigger further consolidation in the biotech industry.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe GOP\u2019s stance on drug pricing is, however, not without potential risks. While Trump has backed away from his earlier proposal of a \u201cmost favored nation\u201d pricing model, if resurrected, it could be more damaging than the IRA. This policy would require the U.S. to pay the lowest price for drugs globally, disproportionately affecting companies with significant price differentials between the U.S. and international markets. Firms like Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) and Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) would likely suffer from this scenario, especially if the policy were extended beyond Medicare. Another area of potential risk under a Republican administration is a reduction in emphasis on pandemic preparedness, which could harm vaccine producers like Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA). Trump\u2019s earlier policies had focused less on bolstering preparedness, a trend that might continue, reducing the government\u2019s focus on pandemic-related R&D.

        "text": "\u201cAmerica Votes\u201d in An Age of Polarization and Democratic Backsliding\nThe first of four panels of the \u201cAmerica Votes 2024: Stanford Scholars on the Election\u2019s Most Critical Questions\u201d series examined the changing political and global landscape shaping the upcoming U.S. presidential and congressional elections. The panelists shed light on the challenges of election administration, shifts in campaign strategies due to polarization, and the global context animating the election. Moderated by Kathryn Stoner, Mosbacher Director of the Center on Democracy, Development and the Rule of Law (CDDRL) and Senior Fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies (FSI), the panel featured Stanford scholars Shanto Iyengar, Beatriz Magaloni, and Nathaniel Persily. The \u201cAmerica Votes 2024\u201d series is co-organized by CDDRL, the Hoover Institution\u2019s Center for Revitalizing American Institutions, and the Institute for Research in the Social Sciences.\n\nEvolving Election Administration and Oversight\n\n\n\nThe 2024 election will differ significantly from previous cycles, said Nathaniel Persily, the James B. McClatchy Professor of Law at Stanford Law School and a Senior Fellow at FSI. That is due to changes in the legal landscape, a shift in the social media environment, and ongoing threats to election officials.\n\nPersily noted that many election officials have resigned due to rising threats. Changes like the Electoral Count Reform Act have impacted the certification process, and the decline of the Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC) has affected voter registration accuracy. Persily raised concerns about how social media platforms have restricted access to election monitoring tools, like CrowdTangle, further complicating election oversight.\n\nWhile new Artificial Intelligence tools are playing a growing role in content moderation on social media, they have limited reach, especially on popular platforms like TikTok. Persily pointed out that misinformation is a continuing concern, with conspiracy theories around mail-in ballots, poll watcher interference, and vote-counting delays potentially undermining public trust. However, he expressed some optimism, indicating that early voting could help election officials proactively address issues before Election Day and that the use of paper ballots in most states will add a layer of security.",

Laney Program in Moral Leadership and The Candler Foundry will host a forum reflecting on the election, the path forward for American democracy and the role of faith communities in healing the country\u2019s divides.\n\nThe event will feature civil rights leader Andrew Young, former mayor of Atlanta and former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, along with distinguished Emory scholars Joseph Crespino, senior associate dean of faculty, divisional dean of humanities and social sciences, and Jimmy Carter Professor of History; and Andra Gillespie, associate professor of political science and director of Emory\u2019s James Weldon Johnson Institute for the Study of Race and Difference. Candler\u2019s own Robert M. Franklin Jr., the program\u2019s organizer, will serve as moderator for the conversation.\n\nFor Franklin, the James T. and Berta Laney Professor in Moral Leadership at Candler, the event represents a rich opportunity for thoughtful discourse during a time of deep division.\n\n\u201cAs I think about what we at Candler are attempting to accomplish as a seminary embedded in a major research university, I think that pausing to understand both our country\u2019s recent and long past, as well as the reasons for the current political and social polarization, is a high priority,\u201d Franklin says.\n\nDuring the forum, each panelist will offer individual reflections, followed by a moderated dialogue with Franklin. Gillespie will comment on poll predictions, actual election results to date and trends; Crespino will consider the election in light of American history, culture and the role of religion; and Young will reflect on the election and the way forward in light of past struggles for justice, inclusion and freedom. There will also be time for the panelists to take questions from the audience.\n\n\u201cThrough this panel, we will aim to listen, discern and understand where our fellow Americans are following such a tense election season,\u201d Franklin says. \u201cThese national experts will help us make sense of the post-election climate and prepare to forge ahead together.\u201d",

What Chinese people want from US election\n\nBBC Mr Meng hopes Trump will win\n\nIn China, people are following the US election with keen interest and some anxiety. They fear what could happen next at home and abroad, whoever wins the White House. \u201cNone of us wants to see a war,\u201d says Mr Xiang, as the music in the park reaches a crescendo and a nearby dancer elegantly spins his partner. He has come to Ritan Park to learn dance with other seniors. They gather here regularly, just a few hundred metres from the Beijing home of the American ambassador in China. In addition to new dance moves, the looming US election is also on their minds.\n\nIt comes at a pivotal time between the two superpowers, with tensions over Taiwan, trade and international affairs running high. \u201cI am worried that Sino-US relations are getting tense,\u201d says Mr Xiang who\u2019s in his 60s. \"Peace is what we want,\" he adds. A crowd has gathered to listen to this conversation. Most are reluctant to give their full names in a country where it is permissible to talk about the US president, but being critical of their own leader could get them in trouble. They say they are worried about war - not just about a conflict between Washington and Beijing but an escalation of current wars in the Middle East and Ukraine. Election polls - is Harris or Trump ahead?\n\nOnly one candidate is talking about China That is why Mr Meng, in his 70s, hopes Donald Trump will win the election. \u201cAlthough he imposes economic sanctions on China, he does not wish to start or fight a war. Mr Biden starts more wars so more ordinary people dislike him. It is Mr Biden who supports Ukraine\u2019s war and both Russia and Ukraine suffer great loss from the war,\u201d he said. Some sisters recording a dance routine for their social media page chip in. \u201cDonald Trump said in the debate that he will end the war in Ukraine 24 hours after he takes office,\u201d says one. \u201cAbout Harris, I know little about her, we think she follows the same route as President Biden who supports war.\u201d Their opinions echo a key message being propagated on Chinese state media.\n\nChina has called on the international community to negotiate a ceasefire in Gaza while aligning itself with what it describes as its \u201cArab brothers\u201d in the Middle East and has been quick to blame the US for its unwavering support of Israel. On Ukraine, Foreign Minister Wang Yi told the United Nations that China was playing a \u201cconstructive role\u201d as he accused Washington of \u201cexploiting the situation for selfish gain\u201d. While most analysts believe Beijing does not have a favourite in this race for the White House, many would agree that Kamala Harris is an unknown quantity to Chinese people and the country\u2019s leaders. Listen to Laura Bicker discuss China/US on The Global Story\n\nXi Jinping has economy worries. What do Chinese people think? But some believe she will be more stable than Trump when it comes to one of the biggest flashpoints between the US and China - Taiwan. \u201cI don\u2019t like Trump. I don\u2019t think there is a good future between the US and China \u2013 there are too many problems, the global economy, and also the Taiwan problem,\u201d says a father of a four-year-old boy in the park for a family day out. He fears their differences over Taiwan could eventually lead to conflict.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want it. I don\u2019t want my son to go to the military,\u201d he says as the young boy pleads to go back on the slide. China claims the self-governing island of Taiwan as its own and President Xi Jinping has said \u201creunification is inevitable\u201d, vowing to retake it by force if necessary. The US maintains official ties with Beijing and recognises it as the only Chinese government under its \"One China policy\" but it also remains Taiwan's most significant international supporter. Washington is bound by law to provide Taiwan with defensive weapons and Joe Biden has said that the US would defend Taiwan militarily, breaking with a stance known as strategic ambiguity. Harris has not gone that far. Instead, when asked in a recent interview she stated a \u201ccommitment to security and prosperity for all nations\u201d. Donald Trump is instead focused on a deal - not diplomacy. He has called on Taiwan to pay for its protection. \u201cTaiwan took our chip business from us. I mean, how stupid are we? They\u2019re immensely wealthy,\u201d he said in a recent interview. \u201cTaiwan should pay us for defence.\u201d\n\nOne of their biggest worries when it comes to the former US president is that he has also made it clear he plans to impose 60% tariffs on Chinese goods. This is the last thing many businesses in China want right now as the country is trying to manufacture enough goods to export itself out of an economic downturn. Ministers in China bristle with contempt at US-led trade tariffs which were first imposed by Donald Trump. President Biden has also levied tariffs, targeting Chinese electric vehicles and solar panels. Beijing believes these moves are an attempt to curb its rise as a global economic power.\n\nGetty Images Trump met Xi in Beijing in 2017\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it will do any good to the US to impose tariffs on China,\u201d says Mr Xiang, echoing the sentiments of many we met. The tariffs will hit the US people, he adds, and increase costs for ordinary people. Many of the younger generation, while patriotic, also look towards the US for trends and culture - and that, perhaps more than any diplomatic mission, has power, too. In the park, Lily and Anna, aged 20 and 22, who get their news from TikTok, echo some of the national messages of pride spread by Chinese state media when it comes to this competitive relationship. \u201cOur country is a very prosperous and powerful country,\u201d they say, dressed in their national costumes. They love China, they said, although they also adore the Avengers and particularly Captain America. Taylor Swift is on their playlists, too.\n\nLily and Anna\n\nOthers like 17-year-old Lucy hope to study in America one day. As she cycles on an exercise bike, newly installed in the park, she dreams about visiting Universal Studios one day - after her graduation. Lucy says she is excited to see there is a female candidate. \u201cHarris\u2019s candidacy marks an important step forward for gender equality, and it\u2019s encouraging to see her as a presidential candidate.\u201d Can Xi fix China's economy? The People\u2019s Republic of China has never had a female leader and not a single woman currently sits on the 24-member team known as the Politburo that comprises most senior members of the Chinese Communist Party. Lucy is also worried about the intense competition between the two countries and believes the best way for China and the United States to improve their relationship is to have more people-to-people exchanges. Both sides have vowed to work towards this, and yet the number of US students studying in China has fallen from around 15,000 in 2011 to 800.\n\nA food stall in Ritan Park\n\nXi hopes to open the door for 50,000 American students to come to China in the next five years. But in a recent interview with the BBC, the US ambassador to China, Nicholas Burns, accused parts of the Chinese government of not taking this pledge seriously. He said that, on dozens of occasions, security forces or a government ministry had prevented Chinese citizens from participating in public diplomacy run by the US. On the other side, Chinese students and academics have reported being unfairly targeted by US border officials. Lucy, however, remains optimistic that she will be able to travel to America one day, to promote Chinese culture. And, as the music strikes up nearby, she urges Americans to visit and experience China. \u201cWe may be a little bit reserved sometimes and not as outgoing or as extrovert as US people, but we are welcoming,\u201d she says as she heads off to join her family.

        "text": "The Impending Betrayal of Ukraine\nThe new NATO Secretary General, Mark Rutte, lost no time in visiting Kyiv after he assumed office, where he \u2018pledged continued support for Ukraine in its war with Russia\u2019. Doubtless his words were sincerely intended, but he knows there are serious political headwinds across Europe and the US.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky senses this too as he briefs his \u2018Victory Plan\u2019 around European capitals following a mixed reception in Washington.\n\nThe forthcoming presidential election in the US represents the point of maximum danger. A win by Donald Trump could see him placing a phone call to Russian President Vladimir Putin as early as 6 November. Any such call would set expectations of a negotiated settlement, with discussions possibly beginning in the early months of 2025.\n\nNobody should want this war of \u2018meat grinder\u2019 savagery to continue a day longer than necessary. However, Zelensky would have much to fear from a deal negotiated by Trump. The 2020 Doha Accords with the Afghan Taliban have been described as the worst diplomatic agreement since Munich in 1938. Fortunately, Trump was prevented from reaching a similarly disastrous deal with Kim Jong-un of North Korea.\n\nIn any such deal, Zelensky would be unlikely to secure the recovery of Crimea and the Donbas, reparations for the massive damage to his country, war crimes trials or membership of NATO. He might be able to bargain the Kursk salient in return for control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. But, without NATO membership and its Article 5 guarantee, there would be nothing to stop Putin from continuing the war after a couple of years of recovery and rearmament.",

        "text": "CBS News Trump-Harris poll shows one election, two worlds: How information, beliefs shape tight campaign\nThe 2024 presidential contest between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump is more than just two ideologies competing over what should happen. It's two groups of voters that look out at the country and don't even agree on what's happening right now.\n\nViews about hurricane relief are just one example of many. To most of former President Donald Trump's voters, that relief isn't going to the people impacted. To Vice President Kamala Harris' voters, it is.\n\nTrump's voters view the U.S. economy as bad, while most Harris voters view the economy as good. Trump's voters say U.S.-Mexico border crossings are increasing now. Harris' voters are more apt to say crossings are down than up. As voting gets underway, far more Trump voters anticipate widespread fraud. Harris' voters do not.\n\nAnd Trump's voters \u2014 especially the men among them \u2014 see themselves in a nation where gender equality efforts have gone too far. For most Harris voters gender equality efforts in the U.S. haven't gone far enough.\n\nThere is at least one thing in common though: each side says they use but don't trust social media. They say that it makes it easier for them to find people they agree with (perhaps reinforcing already-held beliefs) but also harder to tell what's true.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, an already close, effectively even contest draws even tighter. Trump is one point closer to Harris nationally than last month, the decisive battleground states also remain effectively even, a mere one point apart now.\n\nWhat's happening with hurricane relief?\n\nIn the view of most Trump voters, hurricane relief is mainly going to people not impacted by hurricanes, and among them, there's wide belief in the claim that FEMA funds are going to people in the U.S. illegally.\n\nMost Harris voters think those claims are false, that funds are going to people impacted and relief efforts are moving about the right speed.\n\nHere's more information on CBS News' coverage of the hurricane and FEMA aid.\n\nWhat's happening in the economy now?\n\nOn the economy, which often reveals partisan-driven differences, Trump voters overwhelmingly call it bad at the same time most Harris voters call it good.\n\nEven if that's somewhat subjective, there are differences between the camps in what they see on other related measures. Trump voters are less apt than Harris voters to say the stock market is up for the year and less likely to say the U.S. has added jobs of late, though for voters who express a direction, the net balance in both camps is a higher market and more jobs. The perceived implications of that are apparently different, however.\n\nHarris voters are also less likely to think prices are increasing.\n\nHere's more information on CBS News' coverage of the economy.\n\nWhat's happening at the border now?\n\nOn the U.S.-Mexico border, Harris' voters are more inclined to think the number of migrant crossings is decreasing. But Trump's voters are relatively more apt to say crossings are increasing today and that the Biden administration has in fact tried to increase, not reduce, them.\n\nIllegal crossings at the southern border in September reached their lowest levels since the beginning of the Biden administration.\n\nWhen we follow up with voters who think President Biden tried to increase crossings, and ask why, the top answer picked by Trump voters is that they suspect there are efforts to get migrants to vote illegally in U.S. elections.\n\nGender differences and equality efforts\n\nThere are big differences evaluating some cultural or social shifts, which may help partly explain the gender gap, however large it ends up being:\n\nMost Trump voters see efforts to promote gender equality in the U.S. going too far (men backing Trump especially think so) while Harris voters think those efforts aren't going far enough, especially the women backing her.\n\nFor a quarter of women backing Harris, the fact that she is a woman is a part of their decision-making.\n\nFor 10% of men backing Trump, the fact that Harris is a woman is a factor in theirs.\n\nWhat may happen with the election system?\n\nAs voting begins in many states, voters generally trust their states' election system, but Trump's voters are much more skeptical.\n\nOnly a quarter of voters think there will be widespread fraud. Harris voters don't think so, but nearly half of Trump voters do.\n\nAmid all of this, half of Trump voters want him to challenge the election results if Harris wins. Most of Harris' backers want her to accept the results, no matter who wins.\n\nWho do you trust for information?\n\nBigger picture, on who voters trust for truthful information: For Donald Trump's voters, Trump himself is a top source as much as their own family and friends, though they don't show overwhelming trust in a lot of sources presented. Trump does rank more highly than other conservative media figures generally; medical scientists in general; and far more than government economic reports.\n\nHarris' voters, in turn, trust Harris even more than Trump voters trust Trump, but Harris backers are also relatively much more trusting generally of sources, including medical scientists and government reports.\n\nBoth sides share a mistrust of corporate leaders and social media influencers, and each side says they use social media to follow the campaign at about the same rate.\n\nAnd something else supporters of the candidates share: the overwhelming suspicion that foreign governments are trying to influence the election. Most also believe that foreign governments are supporting threats or attempts to harm U.S. presidential candidates.\n\nVoters overall tend to suspect that China and Iran want Harris to win and that Russia wants Trump to win \u2013 but within those numbers, each side thinks those foreign countries want the other candidate to win. Trump voters think Russia wants Harris; Harris voters think Russia wants Trump.\n\nWhat's happening with voter groups?\n\nAmid all this, it is perhaps little surprise that neither candidate can effect large swings. The national preference between the two is still essentially even, as it has been since August, with a one-point move back toward Trump both nationally and in the battlegrounds composite. Behind that, independents have shifted a little now toward Trump.\n\nBlack voters are still voting heavily Democratic, as in past years, right now supporting Harris at the same rate as they did Mr. Biden in 2020. However, the likelihood of turnout for Black voters lags that of White voters, suggesting perhaps there is more for Harris' campaign to do in activating these voters.\n\nNeither candidate has the edge on the ability to handle a federal response to natural disasters. Just about a third of voters have a lot of confidence in either Harris or Trump on this.\n\nVoters think Harris is more likely to make access to affordable health care better rather than worse, while more think Trump would make access worse.\n\nOn abortion: when voters say this is a major factor, Harris enjoys some of her widest margins over Trump. However, over the course of the campaign, the number who rank it as a major factor has not grown.\n\nAlso, her campaign's argument that Trump will try to ban abortion nationally has not resonated with most voters outside of her own party. Most independents, along with Republicans, think Trump will leave the matter of abortion to the states.\n\nOn taxes, Trump has the advantage. Voters are twice as likely to say Harris will make their taxes go up rather than down \u2014 and this is true among all income groups. Voters are more divided on what will happen with their taxes under Trump.\n\nThis CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a representative sample of 2,719 registered voters nationwide interviewed between October 8-11, 2024.

        "text": "Canadians and the U.S. Presidential Election (2024)\nCanadians and the U.S. Presidential Election (2024)\n\nAs part of its Focus Canada public opinion research program (launched in 1976), the Environics Institute updated its research on Canadian attitudes about the United States. This survey was conducted in partnership with the Diversity Institute at Toronto Metropolitan University. This survey is based on telephone interviews conducted (via landline and cellphones) with 2,016 Canadians between September 9 and 23, 2024. A sample of this size drawn from the population produces results accurate to within plus or minus 2.2 percentage points in 19 out of 20 samples.\n\nThe American presidential election has transfixed not only citizens of the United States, but many around the world as well. One way or another, everyone will be affected by the outcome of the vote on November 5. Pollsters in the U.S. are conducting countless surveys to try to capture every shift in public opinion. In Canada, the Environics Institute, through its annual Focus Canada survey, asked Canadians which of the two main candidates for U.S. president \u2013 Democratic Party nominee Kamala Harris or Republican Party nominee Donald Trump \u2013 they most want to see win.\n\nCanadians are three times as likely to prefer that Kamala Harris win the 2024 U.S. presidential election as they are to prefer Donald Trump.\n\n\u0083Preference for the Democratic Party candidate is slightly lower in 2024 (60%) than it was in 2020 (67%), when current U.S. President Joe Biden was the nominee. The proportion of Canadians who prefer Trump rose by six percentage points between 2020 and 2024, from 15 percent to 21 percent.\u0083\n\nCompared to 2020, Donald Trump has gained in popularity among those under 55 years of age, and among those living in Ontario and the West.\n\nMen between the ages of 18 and 34 are evenly split between a preference to see Kamala Harris win and a preference to see Donald Trump win. This differs from the situation in 2020, when younger men favoured Biden over Trump by a margin of two-to-one.\n\nAmong supporters of the federal Conservative Party, Donald Trump edges out Kamala Harris as the preferred winner of the U.S. presidential election. This represents a shift from 2020, when supporters of all the major Canadian federal political parties were more likely to favour the Democratic Party nominee than the Republican Party nominee.\n\nCanadians are currently evenly split between a favourable and an unfavourable opinion of the United States. Canadians have been evenly split on their opinions of the United States since the return of a Democratic Party president to the White House in 2020.\n\nRead the report.\n\nFor more information, contact the Environics Institute or Dr. Andrew Parkin.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Catholic voters favor Trump in most battleground states, according to new NCR poll\nThis combination of photos shows Republican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump, left, and Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris during an ABC News presidential debate at the National Constitution Center, Sept. 10 in Philadelphia. (AP/Alex Brandon, File)\n\nCatholic voters in seven battleground states favor Donald Trump over Kamala Harris by 5 percentage points, but the vice president leads the Republican nominee overwhelmingly among Hispanic and Black Catholics in those swing states, according to a new poll conducted by the National Catholic Reporter. With just more than three weeks to the election, Trump leads Harris 50% to 45% in the closely watched battleground states, a margin that could be an important factor given the closeness of the contest. Most polls say the race is too close to predict, and margins are extremely narrow in the decisive states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Among Hispanic and Black Catholics in the battlegrounds, Harris has an advantage over Trump with nearly seven out of 10 Hispanics and more than three-quarters of Blacks favoring the sitting vice president. The lead among Blacks and Hispanics stems from a strong aversion to Trump as well as an alignment with the vice president on values and key social issues, the poll shows.\n\nSwing-state Catholic voters were more likely to say they support their preferred candidate for reasons that go against church teaching, with Trump supporters favoring his anti-immigration policies and Harris voters backing her views on reproductive rights. Catholic teaching generally favors immigrant rights and opposes abortion. In the battleground states, Catholic populations are sizable and are seen as so important to the Trump and Harris campaigns that both have launched efforts to woo the so-called Catholic vote. In Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, for example, approximately one-quarter of adults identify as Catholic. Among white Catholic voters, Trump's overall lead widens to 16 percentage points. The Republican nominee also leads overall among Catholic voters in five of the seven individual states, although some are within the margin of error. The former president does have larger leads in Wisconsin, where he is up by 18 percentage points, and in Michigan, where he leads by 12 points among Catholic voters. One Wisconsin voter, Jason O'Connell, an insurance worker, said he considers himself a moderate who plans to vote for Trump. \"I prefer less government intervention and more of a capitalist economy,\" O'Connell said. \"I don't think the government should have their hand in the pot.\" The NCR poll, the first focused exclusively on Catholics in swing states, surveyed 1,172 Catholic voters in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. It was conducted by Mercury Analytics Oct. 3-8. The margin of error is plus or minus 2.86%.\n\nFor more about the NCR poll's methodology, click here. For more detail from the poll results, see the file below.\n\nTrump did better among older voters in the NCR poll. Those ages 45 and older opted for Trump over Harris by eight percentage points, while those 44 and younger were tied at 47% for each candidate. Voters ages 18-24 gave Harris a seven-point advantage. Trump also leads among Catholics of all income levels, although some results were within the margin of error. He outperformed among upper-class voters with incomes of over $150,000 annually by 14 points, as compared to middle-class voters with whom he had a three-point lead. The lead was five points among working-class Catholic voters in battleground states. There was a slight, two-point gender gap among Catholic women, although the findings were within the margin of error for women. Catholic men favored Trump over Harris by eight points. The poll reveals how complicated capturing the so-called Catholic vote can be. Among Trump supporters, about three-quarters say they are choosing him because of his anti-immigrant positions, which Pope Francis has called \"against life.\" Similarly, about half of Harris voters say they plan to vote for her because of her support for legal abortion.\n\nA woman prepares to vote in the presidential primary election at a polling place April 2 in Superior, Wisconsin. (OSV News/Reuters/Erica Dischino)\n\nOverall, Catholic voters in battleground states are motivated by pocketbook issues, with three of every four respondents saying the economy was the most important issue to them in this election. Other top issues were immigration/the border (60%), health care (53%), taxes (52%), affordable housing (46%), fighting crime (42%), gun control/Second Amendment rights (41%) and abortion/reproductive rights (37%). Catholic voters in battleground states said the one overriding issue most important to them was the economy, with just over a quarter citing it as a deal-breaker. One in five said immigration/the border was their nonnegotiable issue and 13% cited abortion/reproductive rights as their top nonnegotiable issue. Fifteen percent said there was no one issue for them that was nonnegotiable. When asked which values undergirded their voting decisions, honesty (77%), concern to protect America's way of life (67%) and concern for human dignity and the common good (64%) were the most frequently named by respondents. Hispanic Catholic voters and those ages 18-29 were more likely to indicate that equality was an important value. The Catholic clergy's influence on voters in their flock appears to be extremely limited. While two-thirds of poll respondents said church teaching influences how they think about social and political issues, a minority named priests, bishops, Pope Francis, encyclicals and religious women as major influences. Instead, about six in 10 named Jesus or family and friends as what most influences their decisions, while about half cited the Bible.\n\nThe poll also indicated mixed results from questions about abortion and reproductive rights, raising questions about the influence of religion on voters' views about the subject. A slight majority, 51%, described themselves as \"pro-life,\" while 28% did not. Twenty-one percent were unsure. Catholics' definitions of \"pro-life\" are primarily associated with abortion, which was selected by about eight in 10 of respondents from among a list of life issues. Yet 58% percent of Catholic voters thought abortion should be legal in all or most cases, reflecting other surveys with similar findings. In open-ended responses, some expressed concerns about government infringement on bodily autonomy and lack of support for children after birth from \"pro-life\" policies and politicians.\n\nA roll of \"I Voted Today\" stickers are pictured in a file photo. (OSV News/Reuters/Gary Cameron)\n\nThe NCR survey also indicated high levels of religious belief and practice among Catholics, with 87% saying their Catholic identity and beliefs are important to them and 94% saying they believe in the existence of God. One half pray daily, while one quarter attend Mass weekly. When asked about Pope Francis, 62% had a \"somewhat\" or \"very\" favorable view of him. By comparison, a Pew survey in April found 75% of Catholics viewed Francis favorably, which was down 8 percentage points from 2021 and 15 points from 2015. The NCR poll reflects results from a national poll of more than 7,000 registered voters conducted by the Pew Research Center in April, which found Catholic voters favoring Trump 55% to 43% (against then-Democratic nominee President Joe Biden). The Pew poll, however, showed Hispanic Catholics more closely divided, 49% for Biden and 47% for Trump.\n\nAdvertisement",

        "text": "More Than 165 Lawsuits Shape the 2024 US Presidential Election\nFor the full experience visit: More Than 165 Lawsuits Are Already Shaping the 2024 US Presidential Election\n\nHow are votes counted in Georgia? Where can Wisconsinites drop their absentee ballots? What ID can college students show at polls in North Carolina?\n\nCourts started shaping the US presidential race long before the Nov. 5 election. An extraordinary onslaught of cases filed over the past two years have questioned fundamental principles of who can vote, how ballots are cast, which votes count, and how the winner is decided.\n\nThree weeks out from the election, judges continue to hand down decisions. Earlier today, a Georgia court ruled that state officials have a \u201cmandatory\u201d duty to certify election results. And new cases are still being filed, more fuel for an expected firestorm of legal challenges after the November vote.\n\nIt\u2019s an ominous turn for the world\u2019s oldest democracy. Judges aren\u2019t supposed to decide who wins the White House. And even when courts don\u2019t play a major role in the outcome, lawsuits can amplify the belief that vote counts can\u2019t be trusted \u2013 a perception fueled by conspiracy theories and controversies after Donald Trump refused to concede the 2020 election.\n\n\u201cGrafted onto every major election now is litigation,\u201d said Matthew Haverstick, an attorney at Kleinbard LLC in Pennsylvania who has represented state Republicans. \u201cOne party or another is going to try to use the courts in advance of an election to set the table its way.\u201d\n\nThe 2020 contest and the violence that followed loom over the latest legal fights. Trump and his allies four years ago filed more than 60 lawsuits rooted in unsupported claims of widespread fraud, an unsuccessful effort that culminated with the Jan. 6 riot at the US Capitol.\n\nJudges can be called on to play a critical role in US elections, but it\u2019s rare and almost always controversial. When the fight over Florida\u2019s electoral votes arrived at the US Supreme Court in 2000, Justice Stephen Breyer wrote in a dissenting opinion that \u201cthe court was wrong to take this case\u201d and risked \u201ca self-inflicted wound \u2013 a wound that may harm not just the court, but the nation.\u201d\n\nTwo decades later, the logistical obstacles to voting presented by the pandemic sparked a flurry of pre- and post-election litigation. Republicans opposed the sudden expansion of absentee voting options; Democrats supported it. The chaotic voting landscape fueled Trump\u2019s efforts to use courts to overturn the results.\n\nWell ahead of this year\u2019s matchup, the Republican National Committee launched what it described as a comprehensive and \u201cunprecedented legal strategy\u201d to challenge state and local governments that they say have failed to do enough to protect against illegal voting. The Democratic Party and its allies haven\u2019t been idle, contesting laws that they say keep eligible voters from the polls or put up barriers to voting.\n\nThe court action has been concentrated in the seven states critical for an electoral college victory: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.\n\nTo understand the rapidly changing political-legal tactics, Bloomberg News analyzed cases with the potential to affect voting procedures and ballot counting in the November presidential contest.\n\nOutcomes have been mixed. The RNC lost fights over late-arriving absentee ballots in Nevada and Mississippi and the use of drop boxes in Wisconsin, but won an order limiting voter ID options for North Carolina college students. The DNC joined an unsuccessful push to get undated mail ballots counted in Pennsylvania but backed Wisconsin\u2019s successful defense of its rules for absentee ballots requested online.\n\nFor the GOP, each favorable ruling \u201cis an incremental step towards election integrity,\u201d said Steve Roberts, a partner at the law firm Holtzman Vogel, which represents Republicans in election fights. Voting rights advocates call such claims spurious \u2013 \u201cpure speculation\u201d and \u201ca messaging tool,\u201d said Sophia Lin Lakin, director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Voting Rights Project.\n\nElection officials across the political spectrum strenuously dispute allegations of pervasive problems with voting apparatuses at the state and local level. They say that baseless claims of mismanagement and voter fraud \u2013 which researchers have found is rare \u2013 are the bigger blow to the integrity of elections.\n\nOf the cases tracked by Bloomberg, nearly one-third focus on who should be allowed to vote. The majority have been brought by Republicans or conservative groups seeking to limit access to the polls, chiefly by accusing states of failing to purge their rolls of ineligible voters.\n\nStates have hit back, accusing the challengers of cherry-picking data and casting aspersions on common and lawful voter roll maintenance practices. Many of these cases have been filed since July and are unlikely to wrap up by November \u2013 fueling criticism that they\u2019re primarily aimed at sowing mistrust, not securing tangible outcomes.\n\nDemocrats and left-leaning groups have focused their efforts on expanding, or ensuring, access to the polls. Civil rights groups led by the Alabama Coalition for Immigrant Justice sued to block a directive from Alabama\u2019s Republican Secretary of State Wes Allen to bar from voting more than 3,000 residents listed in a federal database of foreign nationals.\n\nAllen has acknowledged that some of those people may have become citizens and therefore eligible to vote, others may have been listed by mistake; either way, they\u2019d have to prove it. The suit says the broad purge violates voter protections and the US Constitution and is in league with a \u201cnationwide, bad-faith effort\u201d to boost the false idea that non-citizens are voting in large numbers.\n\nThe US Department of Justice also sued Alabama. A federal judge hasn\u2019t ruled yet whether the 3,000 can remain eligible to vote while the cases proceed.\n\nOther eligibility cases have involved whether people with past felony convictions are allowed to vote and how states and counties handle challenges by outside third parties to the validity of voter registrations.\n\nThe Covid pandemic inspired a record 43% of American voters to cast an absentee ballot in 2020. While that fell in the 2022 midterms, it was still well above historic levels.\n\nThe new enthusiasm for remote voting continues to inspire lawsuits. The current fight over Wisconsin\u2019s use of ballot drop boxes resurfaced claims Republicans have been making since 2020, that the practice heightens the risk of fraud. State officials defend it as a secure, time-tested way to encourage voter participation.\n\nIn 2022, the Wisconsin Supreme Court barred the use of drop boxes; in July, a new and more liberal slate of justices reversed the earlier\n\nban.\n\nOf all the cases identified by Bloomberg since January 2023, more than a third were filed in August and September, suggesting a rush for resolution \u2013 or at least the public\u2019s attention \u2013 in the final weeks of the campaign.\n\nIn North Carolina, the RNC sued on Sept. 12 to block students and employees from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from showing their school-issued digital ID cards as proof of identity at the polls. A judge rejected the party\u2019s request on Sept. 20. But a week later, an appeals court reversed and said the digital cards couldn\u2019t be used.\n\nJudges are aware that last-minute decisions risk confusion among voters and could interfere with the administration of the election. There isn\u2019t a hard and fast rule for precisely how close to an election is too close for courts to act , leaving officials in limbo until cases finish moving through the legal system.\n\nElection officials stress that no presidential contest is officially decided in the hours after polls close, no matter what news outlets say. More than half of all states accept at least some absentee ballots that arrive after Nov. 5. It\u2019s a practice that Republicans have gone to court to protest; appeals are pending after the GOP lost fights in Nevada and Mississippi .\n\nOther cases grapple with what happens when voters make mistakes on their ballots. Pennsylvania in particular, with its deadlocked polls and 19 electoral college votes, has become a hotbed for these types of fights.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Pennsylvania rebuffed several challenges to a state law that invalidates undated or misdated mail ballots, even if they arrive on time. Voting rights groups, with support from the DNC, say the rule has led to thousands of rejected votes in past cycles.\n\nThe state\u2019s high court also rejected a case brought by the RNC seeking to block counties from notifying voters about problems with their mail ballots and giving them an opportunity to fix them.\n\nIn 2020, people who voted for President Joe Biden were almost twice as likely to say they mailed in their ballots compared with Trump supporters, according to a Pew Research Center study.\n\nA small but critical subset of cases involves the duty of local election officials to certify vote tallies \u2013 historically an uncontroversial, routine function with little room for independent action. The 2020 election changed that, as Trump\u2019s supporters in swing states explored options to delay or block his loss from being certified by states and Congress.\n\nThis election is the first major test of 2022 congressional legislation that established new deadlines and other processes for states to certify results in presidential contests. Deliberate, partisan foot-dragging could throw the enterprise into uncharted territory \u2013 and into court.\n\nIn the spring, Julie Adams, a Republican member of the Fulton County, Georgia, election board, refused to certify the results of the presidential primary. Ultimately, her reservations were overruled by other members of the election board, but she sued to preemptively protect the ability of county officials to deny certification in November.\n\nA judge ruled against Adams on Oct. 15, writing that officials in her position must certify results. \u201cGeorgia voters would be silenced,\u201d he wrote, if election officers were \u201cfree to play investigator, prosecutor, jury and judge.\u201d\n\nDemocrats \u2013 concerned about a repeat scenario in the battleground state \u2013 are asking the same judge to block new rules adopted by the Republican-majority state election board that require election officials like Adams to conduct a \u201creasonable inquiry\u201d before they certify. The DNC is also suing over the state board\u2019s decision to require a hand count of ballots.\n\nUntil vote counts come in, it\u2019s impossible to know which issues in which states will trigger legal fights after Nov. 5. Ideally courts will dispatch as many cases as possible ahead of election day, says Rebecca Green, co-director of the Election Law Program at William & Mary Law School.\n\nThat\u2019s the best chance to allow judges \u2013 some of whom are elected partisans or federal jurists whose presidential appointment will inevitably be scrutinized \u2013 to retain the high ground, she said: \u201cYou\u2019re resolving these questions at least behind a veil of ignorance about who will benefit.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Marie Monteleone .\n\nTo contact the authors of this story:\n\nZoe Tillman in Washington at ztillman2@bloomberg.net\n\nRaeedah Wahid in New York at rwahid1@bloomberg.net\n\nBenjamin Bain in Washington at bbain2@bloomberg.net\n\nAlex Newman in New York at anewman126@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story:\n\nJanet Paskin at jpaskin@bloomberg.net\n\nElizabeth Wasserman\n\n\u00a9 2024 Bloomberg L.P.

        "text": "Ask an expert: Immigration and the 2024 presidential election\nUNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. \u2014 Immigration remains a top concern for American voters, and a topic fueling much debate in the news and on social media. Penn State News spoke with Jennifer Van Hook, distinguished professor of sociology and demography and director of the Population Research Institute, about immigration and the rhetoric of the presidential election race.\n\nQ: As climate refugees and asylum seekers, particularly from Latin America, migrate to the United States, what kinds of impacts do we see?\n\nVan Hook: In the last few years, we\u2019ve seen large numbers of people applying for asylum from Venezuela, Colombia, Honduras and other Central American countries. Once these immigrants arrive, they are assigned a court date so that they can make their case to a judge who would then determine the outcome for their asylum case. Of course, there are costs to communities where these immigrants settle. For example, for families with children, there's going to be a lot of housing and schooling needs. On the other hand, these immigrants also help fill labor needs. Depending on their immigration status, some have legal rights to work. On balance, it\u2019s sort of a wash \u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u2014 they fill the labor needs that our economy has, and, at the same time, their children are in school and using some of the resources that public services offer.\n\nCertain states are feeling the influxes of immigrants more than others. Some Americans are worried that these immigrants are going to take jobs away from American citizens. Yet past research suggests that this just doesn't happen. The economists who have studied this issue for decades have shown that many immigrants work. But immigrants also help generate new jobs because they are also consumers. They buy groceries, rent houses and purchase services. They grow the economy. Some of them even start new businesses, creating new jobs. The net change in terms of job production is about neutral.\n\nThe other question usually concerns crime. There's no evidence that immigrants increase crime rates. In fact, immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than natural-born American citizens. One possible reason is that they are wary of breaking the law because they're new and under some pressure to make sure that they don't get in trouble.\n\nIf anything, immigrants decrease crime. Some people argue that the presence of immigrants in communities, especially when they are living in ethnic neighborhoods, creates social networks that make crime less common. They're looking after their neighbors' children and their neighbors are looking after their children, and these mutual social ties end up forming communities that make crime less likely to occur.\n\nQ: You research immigrants across generations. What have you found?\n\nVan Hook: We conducted an historical study where we looked at immigrants who arrived during the last big wave of immigration, the ones who came during the industrial era in the late 1800s and early 1900s. We were able to look across three generations, about 80 years of history, to see what happened to those families over time.\n\nYou might be familiar with Italian immigration. There are a lot of Italian descendants who live in Pennsylvania, and their third-generation ancestors \u2014 the grandchildren of the original immigrants \u2014 have been pretty successful. Yet when they first arrived in the United States, they were amongst the lowest educated immigrant group at the time, and Americans were very concerned. Many considered the Italians to be unassimilable. Italian immigrants were seen as likely to get in trouble with the police and unlikely to ever fit in. Now, three generations later, Italian-Americans are one of the most highly educated groups in the country and they are doing better than many of their peers. We've seen this story before with each new wave of immigration. We think they're so different from us and that they'll never become one of us, yet it's been proven wrong over and over again.\n\nAnother thing we learned is that some immigrant groups were prevented from accessing the resources they needed to get ahead. For example, Mexican immigrants from the 1920s and 1930s were not granted equal access to schooling. Their descendants did not make as many strides forward as the groups that did have equal access to schooling under the law. The lesson here is that efforts to exclude immigrants from equal access to services, schooling and higher education don't pay off in the end. In fact, the country ends up with more inequality down the road.\n\nQ: What do the dynamics at the southern border look like? Are we seeing a blip in immigration, or is this a lasting change?\n\nVan Hook: In the last 10 years or so in Central America, and in certain South American countries, there has been tremendous political and economic instability that have made it difficult for some people to continue living there. So, we've seen an increase in out-migration, especially from countries like Venezuela, Honduras and Guatemala, and many of these people applied for asylum.\n\nAt the same time, there have been a series of policy changes at the U.S.-Mexico border. One was in response to COVID-19, where the government reduced admissions at the border. Another was the wait in Mexico policy, where if you were to come to the border and claim asylum, you would have to wait in Mexico for your case to come up in court. These policies created a buildup of demand at the border. When they ended, there was a large increase in border encounters \u00ad\u2014 people who are coming in, often through regular ports of entry, claiming asylum. Many of them are detained, but then released into the United States after being issued a notice to appear in court. And of course, there are so many cases that the courts can't keep up with it all.\n\nOver the summer, the Biden administration implemented a rule change that restricts asylum claims once illegal border crossings reach a certain threshold. Since June, the number of border encounters has dramatically declined. People are now wondering if the recent border surge will return, and it really depends on whether any kind of permanent change in immigration policy can be enacted.",

        "text": "Slovakia\u2019s Security-First Approach to the US Election\nInterest in the US presidential election in Slovakia is much greater this year than in the past. Key media have been paying attention for months and there have been several polls on this issue. This is not only because of the United States\u2019 importance for the country in the context of the transatlantic community, but also due to the turbulences in the international arena and the deterioration of the security situation in Europe.\n\nSlovakia became part of the Euro-Atlantic family 20 years ago, when it joined the EU and NATO. The United States played a key role in its democratization and integration into Western structures. In addition, Slovakia has many historical bonds with the country where the largest Slovak diaspora lives.\n\nWith Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Slovakia, came into direct contact with a hot war in a neighboring country. Located on NATO\u2019s eastern flank, it is also the target of intensive Russian hybrid operations.\n\nSlovakia\u2019s citizens realize that the United States is crucial for ending the war and bringing back a predictable international environment. At the same time, they see that the US political scene is extremely polarized and unpredictable. The unprecedented attacks during the campaign raise concerns for Slovaks about the stability of the US political system and the capacity of the superpower to effectively engage on international issues in a time of multiple crises and increasing autocratic regimes.\n\nIn a September poll, 17% of respondents said they were actively interested in the election and 44% knew that it will take place. A quarter said that they were not interested and 15% that they did not know that the United States will soon elect its president.\n\nIn the same poll, 59% said they would opt for Kamala Harris and 41% for Donald Trump if they were voters in the United States. Harris is popular especially among women, residents of the largest cities, and people with higher education. She mainly appeals to Slovakia\u2019s liberal-democratic camp while Trump is popular among conservatives and nationalists.\n\nAmong voters of the three-member government coalition, Trump is the preferred candidate for those of Direction\u2013Social Democracy (Smer\u2013SD) and the Slovak National Party, while supporters of Voice\u2013Social Democracy (Hlas\u2013SD) are evenly divided between him and Harris.\n\nOn the opposition side, Trump finds considerable favor among the voters of the far-right Republika party. By contrast, enthusiasm for Harris is high among the voters of Progressive Slovakia, Freedom and Solidarity (SaS), the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH), and the Democrats. Supporters of the Slovakia movement are evenly divided between the two candidates.\n\nSmer\u2013SD\u2019s Robert Fico, who became prime minister for the fourth time a year ago, recently said: \u201cI think that if Donald Trump is elected, there is a higher probability of ending the conflict\u201d in Ukraine. When he was previously prime minister, Fico supported Trump in his 2016 campaign for the White House. In this regard, he is like Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orb\u00e1n, who has been openly sympathetic to Trump for a long time.\n\nThe support of Fico and his coalition partners for Trump is related not only to the war in Ukraine, but also to a shared style of politics.\n\nThe support of Fico and his coalition partners for Trump is related not only to the war in Ukraine, but also to a shared style of politics that emphasizes a strong state, a strong leader, and transactional interests in foreign policy.\n\nThe development of the security situation\u2014in particular, the course and possible end of the war\u2014will have a major impact on Slovak-US relations. In recent years, Slovakia has increasingly focused on security cooperation with the United States. In 2018, it signed a $1.8 billion deal to purchase 14 US F-16 fighter jets, and in July it took possession of the first two jets. (The rest will be gradually delivered over the next two years). The F-16s will significantly increase Slovakia\u2019s defense capabilities. In February 2022, the two countries signed a Defense Cooperation Agreement (DCA).\n\nFico\u2019s government could be in office for most of the next US presidential term as the next parliamentary elections are not due before 2027. Given Washington\u2019s importance as a strategic security and economic partner, the government will very likely continue to strive to maintain this partnership regardless of who occupies the White House.\n\nDespite Fico\u2019s strong pre-election opposition to the DCA and continuous anti-US rhetoric, his government is adhering to the agreement. So far, it seems that, despite his political opportunism and Russophile talk, he grudgingly accepts that the best alignment for the sovereignty of a small country like Slovakia is within US-led NATO.\n\nMeanwhile, President Peter Pellegrini, who is only six months into his five-year term, is trying not to alienate US-skeptical voters but has quite obvious pro-West instincts. He will most likely advocate a transatlanticist policy.\n\nNo matter who wins the US election, Washington will judge Slovakia\u2019s government, and most others in Europe, not on its rhetoric, but on how much it aligns itself with the next administration\u2019s security and economic policies as well as on how much it fulfills its obligations in Euro-Atlantic structures.\n\nIf Trump is elected, the US attitude toward countries like Slovakia will likely be especially transactional, with values and human rights less prominent in the relationship. And, given that Slovakia is not likely to get much attention from the president, much will depend on who Trump picks for his secretaries of state and defense and his national security advisor.\n\nIf Harris wins, US policy in Europe could be quite similar to that during the Biden administration, with adherence to liberal-democratic values taken into consideration when dealing with the leaders and governments of different countries. In Central and Eastern Europe, this was seen in Washington\u2019s dealings with Hungary over the last three years, and it could bring more of a US spotlight on the domestic political situation and the government in Slovakia.\n\nThis article is part of series in which GMF experts from Central and Eastern Europe set out the implications of a Harris or Trump win in the US presidential election for the countries in the region.",

        "text": "Media Influence on Politics: 7 Election Trends in 2024\nWhen it comes to turmoil, the 2024 U.S. presidential election has few rivals. The race, which will culminate in a new president-elect after Nov. 5, has for months been steeped in drama, surprising turnabouts and near tragedy. Media influence on politics has played a critical role in shaping public perception, adding layers of complexity to issues like misinformation, polarization, and violent rhetoric. Against a backdrop of assassination attempts and international strife, this election has challenged pollsters, fatigued \u2014 and also energized \u2014 voters, and upended the campaigns and the candidates themselves.\n\nTo understand how this election has created a new landscape for political coverage, we spoke with five professors from the UO School of Journalism and Communication (SOJC) who shared seven trends that illustrate the media\u2019s influence on politics.\n\n1. Newfound election enthusiasm replaces news fatigue and news avoidance.\n\nFor the bulk of the 2024 election cycle \u2014 when the race was between the two oldest party nominees in history \u2014 news fatigue and news avoidance limited the type and amount of information that people, especially younger voters, were getting.\n\nWhitney Phillips, SOJC assistant professor of digital platforms and ethics, urges voters to prioritize their mental health so they can continue to engage in election coverage rather than avoiding all news about it.\n\nEven those who did not spend a lot of time scrolling traditional news sources were burning out, said Whitney Phillips, SOJC assistant professor of digital platforms and ethics.\n\n\u201cNews fatigue is when there are so many articles and angles to keep up with, and it\u2019s all so upsetting and depressing,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cThat can 100% lead a person down the road to overwhelm. But a person can end up having that same experience just by getting too many text messages.\u201d\n\nBurnout may have also been the reason Phillips noticed people were having fewer conversations about election news. If people tune out because news sources are not delivering what consumers want, that\u2019s an indication that the agenda-setting function of the news media is not what it used to be.\n\n\u201cThere's often a disconnect between what the average person is consuming and what cable news producers are producing,\u201d she said.\n\nHowever, Regina Lawrence, associate dean of SOJC Portland and research director of the SOJC\u2019s Agora Journalism Center, acknowledges that when Kamala Harris became the nominee, election enthusiasm spiked and news coverage ramped up. The Harris-Trump debate drew more than 67 million viewers, and the percentage of Americans who say they are following election news at least somewhat closely has increased since Joe Biden dropped out of the race, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\n\u201cWhile many people are probably still feeling news fatigue regarding the election, the last-minute shake-up of the race has ignited new enthusiasm among many other voters,\u201d Lawrence said.\n\n2. Media report on the horse race instead of policy-related issues.\n\nJournalists and media shape election coverage by deciding which candidates to cover and how to cover them, often focusing on the two leading candidates in a horse race: who\u2019s winning vs. who\u2019s losing.\n\nSeth Lewis, SOJC\u2019s Shirley Pap\u00e9 Chair in Emerging Media and journalism area director, encourages journalists to focus on policy-related issues rather than who\u2019s leading in the polls.\n\nBut that\u2019s usually not the best approach, said Seth Lewis, SOJC\u2019s Shirley Pap\u00e9 Chair in Emerging Media and journalism area director.\n\n\u201cJournalists become too fixated on the contest and the game as opposed to understanding the broader array of issues that are not just about who's winning or losing, but rather what people actually care about,\u201d Lewis said.\n\nLewis, whose research focuses on perceptions of media bias and other topics related to elections, encourages journalists to cover policy-related issues and substantive topics that people want to know about, particularly if that means putting less focus on who\u2019s winning.\n\n\u201cThere could be a big gap between what ordinary people care about and what politicians think they care about,\u201d he said.\n\nLewis echoes New York University Professor Jay Rosen\u2019s mantra, \u201cnot the odds, but the stakes.\u201d Rosen has been urging newsrooms across the country to organize campaign coverage around the stakes of the election rather than the contest alone.\n\n\u201cThe stakes refer to the impact on American democracy and what might happen as a result of the election,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cHow will life or the world or a country be different if Person A is elected versus Person B? Ultimately, that is more important than who happens to be ahead by two or three points in a given political poll.\u201d\n\n3. Mental health affects media consumption.\n\nThe relationship between mental health and communication is something Phillips has spent a lot of time studying and now is reflecting on as she teaches a generation with historically high expectations and stressors.\n\n\u201cThe more stressed out we are, the less effective and generous our communication practices tend to be,\u201d she said. \u201cWe get overwhelmed, and the fight/flee/freeze response really affects how we communicate. People get really reactive, and they yell, but one of the more underappreciated consequences of that level of stress and overwhelm is that people shut down. That happens in actual survival moments, but it also happens in terms of communication.\u201d\n\nThis is a form of news avoidance. Many Americans have not fully processed everything that\u2019s happened since 2020 \u2014 including COVID, the last presidential election, election denialism, the Jan. 6 insurrection and racial unrest \u2014 Phillips said.\n\nAfter all that turmoil, people were expected to get back to normal, she said.\n\n\u201cThere are too many things happening in the world, and many people end up having a shutdown response,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cThat can be just as corrosive to democratic participation as all of the screaming.\u201d\n\nThe shutdown response, Phillips explained, comes with consequences.\n\n\u201cMy students often admit to avoiding political discussions or avoiding the news because they're too overwhelmed,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cI have heard similar things from friends and family. This makes sense; sometimes we need to step back. But what do you do if huge segments of the country just can't engage in critical moments? How does that work within a deliberative democracy?\u201d\n\nTo prevent the shutdown response, Phillips encourages people to take care of their mental health, especially during election season.\n\n\u201cHow can you keep yourself as healthy as possible so that you can keep showing up and keep engaging with stories that are only going to get increasingly weirder?\u201d she asked.\n\n4. Partisan media limits balanced news coverage.\n\nDid voters become more polarized as more sources of partisan media emerged, or was it the other way around? It\u2019s a chicken-and-egg scenario that might be hard to ever figure out. But it\u2019s clear that both the number of partisan news sources and the amount of polarization among voters have skyrocketed in the past two decades as the number of new media formats has exploded.\n\nRegina Lawrence, associate dean of SOJC Portland and research director of the SOJC\u2019s Agora Journalism Center, said that when President Joe Biden dropped out of the race, election enthusiasm spiked and news coverage ramped up.\n\nAs a result, many voters choose news sources that skew toward their already-cemented views, preventing themselves from getting a balanced view.\n\n\u201cFox covered the trial of Donald Trump comparatively less than the other television networks,\u201d Lawrence pointed out. \u201cThat's an example of media outlets deciding how they're going to cover a particular individual based on partisanship.\u201d\n\nThere are partisan media outlets on both sides of the political spectrum, but many people only notice bias from beliefs that conflict with their own. This is what researchers refer to as the \u201chostile media phenomenon,\u201d Lawrence said. \u201cThe bias we notice in the news is usually the bias we disagree with,\u201d Lawrence said.\n\n\u201cMany conservatives feel the mainstream media have a strong liberal bias and shape their coverage based on partisan considerations,\u201d she said. \u201cThose news organizations would say they\u2019re trying to play it straight down the middle. It's a good reminder that the question of bias is all in the eye of the beholder.\u201d\n\nEven if voters are not relying on the media to sway their views, news outlets still have an important role, she said.\n\n\u201cThe way media will matter is in ginning up what people already believe and are passionate about \u2014 the things they're angry about, fearful about, excited about, whatever it might be \u2014 and keeping that going,\u201d Lawrence said. \u201cThat's motivation for people to turn out and vote.\u201d\n\n5. Polls can be confusing and may lack accuracy.\n\nPolls get a bad rap for good reason, SOJC public relations instructor Tina McCorkindale said.\n\n\u201cThey can be informative, yet dangerous at the same time,\u201d she said. \u201cI'm also seeing changes in how people respond to polls, which calls into question the validity or truthfulness of polls.\u201d One reason is due to what has become known as the \u201cTrump effect,\u201d which has skewed poll samples.\n\nSOJC public relations instructor Tina McCorkindale says that to understand the accuracy of polls, it\u2019s important that voters know how to read a poll and what the margin of error means.\n\n\u201cBecause there has been an increased distrust in science, people who may be far right are less likely to trust polls, so they're less likely to take polls,\u201d McCorkindale explained. \u201cTherefore, the people who take polls could be different from the general population.\u201d\n\nTo understand the accuracy of polls, it\u2019s important to know how to read a poll and what the margin of error means.\n\n\u201cBe very careful when reading poll results. There are multiple variables to consider when reporting poll results,\u201d McCorkindale said. Voters should find out who filled out the survey, how it was collected, who the sponsor was and who did the polling.\n\n\u201cAnd absolutely look at the sample size because the sample size tells you the margin of error,\u201d McCorkindale emphasized. \u201cThe margin of error tells you how confident the range of results is.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cAlso, know how they ask the question. Sometimes polls can prime people with questions depending on the order in which they are presented, and people change their minds all the time, which is why poll numbers vary over time.\u201d\n\n6. Candidates are using social media to control the message.\n\nWith social media, candidates can reach voters directly without relying on the traditional news media as a filter, amplifying social media\u2019s role in the election.\n\n\u201cThe mainstream media probably matter less and less in terms of how people are engaging with elections,\u201d Lawrence said.\n\nAs more voters get their news from social media, journalists are turning to platforms like X (formerly Twitter) to monitor voter opinion, Lawrence said.\n\n\u201cPolitical journalists tend to pay a lot of attention to X because they know that it's a really efficient way to hear from opinion leaders and state and local reporters, and get a read on how people are thinking and talking about the election,\u201d Lawrence said. \u201cThe huge problem is that only a fraction of Americans say that they actually get their news regularly from X. So when reporters pay a lot of attention to it, they're actually paying close attention to a skewed representation of opinion.\u201d\n\nLawrence cited the example of Trump's use of social media in 2016.\n\n\u201cHis use of Twitter very effectively drove news coverage because it created a controversy online that journalists would report on,\u201d Lawrence said. \u201cIt created these waves of ongoing attention to his campaign.\u201d\n\nSocial media also has a way of shaping election narratives, Lewis said.\n\n\u201c\u200b\u200bThere's no question that social media is the primary media through which political campaigning occurs today,\u201d Lewis said.\n\nIt\u2019s not just because candidates and their supporters use it, he said. It\u2019s also the way advertising is conducted.\n\n\u201cPolitical advertising was once most prominent through television commercials, and those still matter to a degree, but the fact is not as many people are watching traditional linear television anymore. They\u2019re on YouTube, Instagram or TikTok. Social media allows candidates to micro-target to reach very specific demographics of potential voters as opposed to television. It has also enabled politics to feel much more personal,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cSocial media is a really important stage on which the political process plays out.\u201d\n\n7. Trolls are influencing voters.\n\nPhillips, who researches internet trolling and has written numerous articles on the topic, said trolls from the MAGA ecosystem who rile people up with antagonistic rhetoric are having a huge impact on the election.\n\n\u201cThat is how you go viral,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cYou build a brand within the right-wing media ecosystem by trolling the libs the best. It's a business strategy, a political strategy and a rhetorical strategy. Also, it's fun for them.\u201d\n\nPhillips acknowledged that while some Trump supporters act out of grievance and anger, many find enjoyment in the conflict. \u201cWhat we need to really understand is that there are a lot of people who are just enjoying themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cThere's fun in the fight, particularly fighting liberals, and taking on this mantle of the culture wars.\u201d\n\nHow students can engage with the 2024 election coverage\n\nThere are many ways students might engage with the 2024 election \u2014 through their coursework, interviewing fellow students, taking the time to understand the issues and becoming better-informed voters.\n\nFor students participating in their first presidential election, this is a good time to think about what it means to be a voter in this country and the rights and responsibilities connected to that, Lewis said.\n\nDamian Radcliffe, professor of practice and Carolyn S. Chambers Professor in Journalism, encourages students to consume news widely from a range of sources.\n\n\u201cAlso, given the level of disagreement and polarization and fractious politics today, this is a good time to think about how to facilitate greater dialogue and understanding across political differences,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cLearning to listen with real empathy is the gateway to connection and, maybe eventually, persuasion.\u201d\n\nTo navigate the complex information environment, Lawrence suggests that students diversify their media diet.\n\nLikewise, Damian Radcliffe, professor of practice and Carolyn S. Chambers Professor in Journalism, encourages students to register to vote and consume news widely from a range of sources. \u201cConsume a bunch of different perspectives, don\u2019t just stay in an echo chamber,\u201d he said.\n\nLawrence recommends students think critically about their own beliefs.\n\n\u201cRemember that hostile media phenomenon?\u201d she said. \u201cYou might think that a source is great and covers everything, but that might be because they're covering it in line with your beliefs. Try your best to check yourself and to see if that's what's going on. It's an ongoing practice of reading, watching, listening, thinking critically for yourself, going back and reading, watching and listening more.\u201d\n\nFinally, Phillips urges students to monitor their mental health.\n\n\u201cTake care of yourself,\u201d she said. \u201cThere might be this impulse that in order to be a good citizen and a good media consumer, I've got to know everything that's going on. The trick is paying attention to what you are experiencing emotionally and psychologically when you engage with news or have conversations with friends, and figure out how to take care of yourself, both psychologically and physically, because those two things are obviously linked.\u201d\n\nFor students who have produced election coverage themselves, SOJC Instructor of Journalism and Director of the Journalism Master's Program Will Yurman launched the Election Coverage 2024 project.

        "text": "Fortinet FortiGuard Labs Observes Darknet Activity Targeting the 2024 United States Presidential Election\nAs the 2024 U.S. presidential election approaches, it\u2019s critical to recognize and understand the cyberthreats that may impact the integrity and trustworthiness of the election process and the welfare of the participating citizens. Cyber adversaries, including state-sponsored actors and hacktivist groups, are increasingly active leading up to major events like elections. Remaining vigilant and identifying and analyzing potential cyberthreats and vulnerabilities is crucial for preparing and safeguarding against the lures and targeted cyberattacks that could take advantage of a heightened moment in time and even disrupt or influence electoral outcomes.\n\nNews Summary\n\nFortinet\u00ae (NASDAQ: FTNT), the global cybersecurity leader driving the convergence of networking and security, today released its FortiGuard Labs Threat Intelligence Report: Threat Actors Targeting the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election, which reveals and analyzes threats tied to U.S.-based entities, voters, and the electoral process. Key findings from the threat intelligence report include:\n\nPhishing Scams Targeting Voters Leading Up to the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election: Threat actors are selling affordable phishing kits on the darknet designed to target voters and donors by impersonating the presidential candidates and their campaigns.\n\nThreat actors are selling affordable phishing kits on the darknet designed to target voters and donors by impersonating the presidential candidates and their campaigns. Malicious Domain Registrations on the Rise: More than 1,000 new potentially malicious domains have also been registered since the beginning of 2024 that follow particular patterns and incorporate election-related content and candidates, suggesting that threat actors are leveraging the heightened interest surrounding the election to lure unsuspecting targets and potentially conduct malicious activities.\n\nMore than 1,000 new potentially malicious domains have also been registered since the beginning of 2024 that follow particular patterns and incorporate election-related content and candidates, suggesting that threat actors are leveraging the heightened interest surrounding the election to lure unsuspecting targets and potentially conduct malicious activities. Darknet Landscape: Billions of records from the U.S. are for sale on darknet forums, including Social Security numbers (SSNs), personally identifiable information (PII), and credentials that could be used in misinformation campaigns and lead to fraudulent activity, phishing scams, and account takeover; approximately 3% of the posts on darknet forums involve databases related to business and government entities.\n\nBillions of records from the U.S. are for sale on darknet forums, including Social Security numbers (SSNs), personally identifiable information (PII), and credentials that could be used in misinformation campaigns and lead to fraudulent activity, phishing scams, and account takeover; approximately 3% of the posts on darknet forums involve databases related to business and government entities. Ransomware Landscape: FortiGuard Labs researchers noted a 28% increase in ransomware attacks against the U.S. government year-over-year based on observed leak sites.\n\nScams Targeting the U.S. 2024 Presidential Election Flood the Darknet\n\nCyber adversaries, including state-sponsored actors and hacktivist groups, are increasingly active in the lead-up to elections.\n\nThe FortiGuard Labs research team observed threat actors selling distinct phishing kits for $1,260 each, created to impersonate U.S. presidential candidates. These kits are designed to harvest personal information, including names, addresses, and credit card (donation) details.\n\nSince January 2024, FortiGuard Labs researchers have also identified more than 1,000 newly registered domain names that incorporate election-related terms and references to prominent political figures. Fraudulent fundraising websites, including secure[.]actsblues[.]com, meant to imitate the legitimate site for ActBlue (secure[.]actblue[.]com), a nonprofit American fundraising platform and political action committee.\n\nThe top two most-used hosting providers for these election-themed websites are AMAZON-02 and CLOUDFLARENET. The reliance on major hosting platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Cloudflare suggests that threat actors are leveraging these reputable services to enhance the legitimacy and resilience of their malicious domains.\n\nA notable concentration of domains is associated with a limited number of IP addresses, indicating a centralized approach by threat actors to efficiently manage multiple malicious domains to execute large-scale cyber campaigns.\n\nNo Shortage of Personal Data Being Sold Aimed at the U.S.\n\nFortiGuard Labs analysis continues to show a significant number of diverse databases available on darknet forums targeting the U.S., including SSNs, usernames, email addresses, passwords, credit card data, date of birth, and other PII that could be used to challenge the integrity of the 2024 U.S. election. Specific highlights include:\n\nOver 1.3 billion rows of combo lists, which include usernames, email addresses, and passwords, signify a considerable risk for credential-stuffing attacks. In such attacks, cybercriminals use these stolen credentials to gain unauthorized access to accounts, making it a valid and substantial security concern.\n\nThe discovery of 300,000 rows of credit card data, which include CVV, name, card number, expiration date, and date of birth, highlights potential financial fraud risks targeting voters and election officials.\n\nOver 2 billion rows of user databases on the darknet indicate a heightened exposure to identity theft and targeted phishing attacks.\n\n10% of the posts on darknet forums are associated with SSN databases, which poses a significant threat by increasing the risk of personal data breaches.\n\nThe U.S. Government Is an Increasingly Attractive Target\n\nRansomware attacks targeting government agencies before an election can impact the electoral process and public trust in government institutions. Compared to 2023, the FortiGuard Labs research team observed a 28% spike in ransomware attacks against the U.S. government in 2024.\n\nThe darknet has become a hub for U.S.-specific threats, where malicious actors trade sensitive information and can potentially develop strategies to exploit vulnerabilities. Approximately 3% of the posts on these forums involve databases related to business and government entities. These databases hold critical organizational data that is vulnerable to cyber exploits and are a prime target for threat actors as the elections come and go.\n\nRecommendations to Prevent and Mitigate Cyberattacks this Election Season\n\nCybersecurity measures are critical to safeguard the integrity of the U.S. 2024 presidential election. Following fundamental best practices can help prevent and mitigate the effects of cyber incidents. The full list of recommendations and best practices can be found in the report, but some key takeaways for citizens, business leaders, and election officials include:\n\nAlways remain vigilant for suspicious behavior or activity leading up to major events and prioritize good cyber hygiene.\n\nPrioritize employee training and awareness.\n\nEnforce multi-factor authentication and a strong-password policy.\n\nInstall endpoint protection solutions.\n\nPatch operating systems and web servers and update software regularly.\n\nAbout the Fortinet FortiGuard Labs Election Security Report\n\nThis report provides an in-depth analysis of threats observed from January 2024 to August 2024. It examines the diverse array of cyberthreats that may affect U.S.-based entities and the electoral process.\n\nAdditional Resources",

        "text": "Would Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs hurt US consumers?\nWould Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs hurt US consumers?\n\nReuters\n\nDonald Trump has said he will impose new tariffs on goods entering the US from Canada, Mexico and China on his first day in office. The US president-elect said he would sign an executive order for a 25% tariff - or tax on imports - on all goods coming from Canada and Mexico, to get both countries to crack down on illegal immigration and drug trafficking. He has also vowed to hit goods coming from China with a 10% tariff \"above any additional tariffs\" until it cuts fentanyl smuggling. He has already pledged to target the country with a 60% rate, and has mulled a 200% tax on some car imports. Tariffs are a central part of Trump's economic vision - he sees them as a way of growing the US economy, protecting jobs and raising tax revenue. During his election campaign, he told voters that the taxes were \"not going to be a cost to you, it\u2019s a cost to another country\". That was almost universally regarded by economists as misleading.\n\nHow do tariffs work?\n\nIn practical terms, a tariff is a domestic tax levied on goods as they enter the country, proportional to the value of the import. So a car imported to the US with a value of $50,000 (\u00a338,000) subject to a 25% tariff, would face a $12,500 charge. The charge is physically paid by the domestic company that imports the goods, not the foreign company that exports them. So, in that sense, it is a straightforward tax paid by domestic US firms to the US government. Over the course of 2023, the US imported around $3,100bn of goods, equivalent to around 11% of US GDP.\n\nAnd tariffs imposed on those imports brought in $80bn in that year, around 2% of total US tax revenues. The question of where the final \u201ceconomic\u201d burden of tariffs falls, as opposed to the upfront bill, is more complicated. If the US importing firm passes on the cost of the tariff to the person buying the product in the US in the form of higher retail prices, it would be the US consumer that bears the economic burden. If the US importing firm absorbs the cost of the tariff itself and doesn\u2019t pass it on, then that firm is said to bear the economic burden in the form of lower profits than it would otherwise have enjoyed.\n\nAlternatively, it is possible that foreign exporters might have to lower their wholesale prices by the value of the tariff in order to retain their US customers. In that scenario, the exporting firm would bear the economic burden of the tariff in the form of lower profits. All three scenarios are theoretically possible. But economic studies of the impact of the new tariffs that Trump imposed in his first term of office between 2017 and 2020 suggest most of the economic burden was ultimately borne by US consumers. A survey by the University of Chicago in September 2024 asked a group of respected economists whether they agreed with the statement that \"imposing tariffs results in a substantial portion of the tariffs being borne by consumers of the country that enacts the tariffs, through price increases\". Only 2% disagreed.\n\nRaising prices\n\nLet\u2019s use a concrete example. Trump imposed a 50% tariff on imports of washing machines in 2018. Researchers estimate the value of washing machines jumped by around 12% as a direct consequence, equivalent to $86 per unit, and that US consumers paid around $1.5bn extra a year in total for these products. There is no reason to believe the results of even higher import tariffs from a future Trump administration would be any different in terms of where the economic burden would fall. The non-partisan Peterson Institute for International Economics has estimated Trump\u2019s new proposed tariffs would lower the incomes of Americans, with the impact ranging from around 4% for the poorest fifth to around 2% for the wealthiest fifth. A typical household in the middle of the US income distribution, the think tank estimates, would lose around $1,700 each year.\n\nThe left-of-centre think tank Centre for American Progress, using a different methodology, has an estimate of a $2,500 to $3,900 loss for a middle-income family. Various researchers have also warned that another major round of tariffs from the US would risk another spike in domestic inflation.\n\nImpact on jobs\n\nYet Trump has used another economic justification for his tariffs: that they protect and create US domestic jobs. \u201cUnder my plan, American workers will no longer be worried about losing your jobs to foreign nations, instead, foreign nations will be worried about losing their jobs to America,\" he said on the campaign trail. The political context for Trump\u2019s tariffs was longstanding concern about the loss of US manufacturing jobs to countries with lower labour costs, particularly after the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with Mexico in 1994 and the entry of China into the World Trade Organisation in 2001. In January 1994, when Nafta came into effect, the US had just under 17 million manufacturing jobs. By 2016, this had declined to around 12 million. Yet economists say it is misleading to attribute this decline to trade, arguing that growing levels of automation are also an important factor. And researchers who studied the impact of Trump\u2019s first-term tariffs found no substantial positive effects on overall employment in US industrial sectors that were protected. Trump imposed 25% tariffs on imported steel in 2018 to protect US producers. By 2020, total employment in the US steel sector was 80,000, still lower than the 84,000 it had been in 2018.\n\nIt is theoretically possible that employment might have dropped even further without the Trump steel tariffs but detailed economic studies of their impact on US steel still showed no positive employment impact. And economists have also found evidence suggesting that, because the domestic price of steel rose after the tariffs were imposed, employment in some other US manufacturing sectors, which relied on steel as an input - including the agricultural machinery manufacturer Deere & Co - was lower than it otherwise would have been.\n\nImpact on trade deficit\n\nTrump has criticised America's trade deficit, which is the difference between the value of all the things the country imports and the value of its exports in a given year. \u201cTrade deficits hurt the economy very badly,\u201d he has said. In 2016, just before Trump took office, the total goods and services deficit was $480bn, around 2.5% of US GDP. By 2020, it had grown to $653bn, around 3% of GDP, despite his tariffs.\n\nPart of the explanation, according to economists, is that Trump\u2019s tariffs increased the international relative value of the US dollar (by automatically reducing demand for foreign currencies in international trade) and that this made the products of US exporters less competitive globally. Another factor behind this failure to close the trade deficit is the fact that tariffs, in a globalised economy with multinational companies, can sometimes be bypassed. For example, the Trump administration imposed 30% tariffs on Chinese imported solar panels in 2018. The US Commerce Department presented evidence in 2023 that Chinese solar panel manufacturers had shifted their assembly operations to countries such as Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam and then sent the finished products to the US from those countries, effectively evading the tariffs. There are some economists who support Trump\u2019s tariff plans as a way to boost US industry, such as Jeff Ferry of the Coalition for A Prosperous America, a domestic lobby group, but they are a small minority of the profession. Oren Cass, the director of the conservative think tank American Compass, has argued tariffs can incentivise firms to keep more of their manufacturing operations in America, which he argues has national defence and supply chain security benefits. And the Biden/Harris administration, while sharply criticising Trump\u2019s proposed extension of tariffs, has kept in place many of the ones he implemented after 2018. It has also imposed new tariffs on imports of things like electric vehicles from China, justifying them on the grounds of national security, US industrial policy and unfair domestic subsidies from Beijing.",

Where can Wisconsinites drop their absentee ballots? What ID can college students show at polls in North Carolina?\n\nCourts started shaping the US presidential race long before the Nov. 5 election. An extraordinary onslaught of cases filed over the past two years has questioned fundamental principles of who can vote, how ballots are cast, which votes count, and how the winner is decided.\n\nBloomberg identified at least 165 lawsuits filed since 2023 across 37 states that challenge every facet of the US presidential contest. More than half of these cases have been filed in the seven states where polls show the race is closest between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. Republicans and conservative advocates have been more active than Democrats and their allies, filing 55% of cases. The Republican National Committee has adopted an aggressive legal strategy, bringing lawsuits or trying to jump into other cases. The Democratic National Committee has been directly involved in less litigation, but its docket includes some of the highest-stakes fights in Georgia.\n\nThree weeks out from the election, judges continue to hand down decisions. On Tuesday, a Georgia court ruled that state officials have a \u201cmandatory\u201d duty to certify election results. And new cases are still being filed, more fuel for an expected firestorm of legal challenges after the November vote.\n\nIt\u2019s an ominous turn for the world\u2019s oldest democracy. Judges aren\u2019t supposed to decide who wins the White House. And even when courts don\u2019t play a major role in the outcome, lawsuits can amplify the belief that vote counts can\u2019t be trusted \u2013 a perception fueled by conspiracy theories and controversies after Donald Trump refused to concede the 2020 election.\n\n\u201cGrafted onto every major election now is litigation,\u201d said Matthew Haverstick, an attorney at Kleinbard LLC in Pennsylvania who has represented state Republicans. \u201cOne party or another is going to try to use the courts in advance of an election to set the table its way.\u201d\n\nThe 2020 contest and the violence that followed loom over the latest legal fights. Trump and his allies four years ago filed more than 60 lawsuits rooted in unsupported claims of widespread fraud, setting the stage for the Jan. 6 riot at the US Capitol.\n\nSupporters of US President Donald Trump gather outside the Capitol building in Washington on Jan. 6, 2021. Photographer: Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nJudges can be called on to play a critical role in US elections, but it\u2019s rare and almost always controversial. When the fight over Florida\u2019s electoral votes arrived at the US Supreme Court in 2000, Justice Stephen Breyer wrote in a dissenting opinion that \u201cthe court was wrong to take this case\u201d and risked \u201ca self-inflicted wound \u2013 a wound that may harm not just the court, but the nation.\u201d\n\nTwo decades later, the logistical obstacles to voting presented by the pandemic in 2020 sparked a flurry of pre- and post-election litigation. Republicans opposed the sudden expansion of absentee voting options; Democrats supported it. The chaotic voting landscape fueled Trump\u2019s efforts to use courts to overturn the results.\n\nWell ahead of this year\u2019s matchup, the Republican National Committee launched what it described as a comprehensive and \u201cunprecedented legal strategy\u201d to challenge state and local governments that they say have failed to do enough to protect against illegal voting. In an interview this week with Bloomberg News, Trump showed he\u2019s watching the dockets, criticizing the Department of Justice\u2019s efforts to reinstate Virginia voters who were recently removed from the polls.\n\nThe Democratic Party and its allies haven\u2019t been idle, contesting laws that they say keep eligible voters from the polls or put up barriers to voting.\n\n2024 Election Fights Mount as Vote Nears Cases by date filed and partisan affiliation of plaintiff Republican or conservative\n\nDemocrat, progressive or liberal\n\nRepublican National Committee\n\nDemocratic National Committee\n\nAll other cases Source: Bloomberg analysis of court filings\n\nThe court action has been concentrated in the seven states critical for an electoral college victory: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.\n\nTo understand the rapidly changing political-legal tactics, Bloomberg News analyzed cases with the potential to affect voting procedures and ballot counting in the November presidential contest.\n\nJudges have grappled with a wide range of election procedures, including how Americans register to vote, how states maintain the voter rolls, when mail ballots are due and what election officials can and can\u2019t do in finalizing the results. Republicans and conservative groups have focused on narrowing the electorate, mostly by pushing to remove names from lists of registered voters. Democrats and left-leaning groups have challenged Republican-led states over what they argue are illegal barriers to voting.\n\nOutcomes have been mixed. The RNC lost fights over late-arriving absentee ballots in Nevada and Mississippi and the use of drop boxes in Wisconsin, but won an order limiting voter ID options for North Carolina college students. The DNC joined an unsuccessful push to get undated mail ballots counted in Pennsylvania but backed Wisconsin\u2019s successful defense of its rules for absentee ballots requested online.\n\nFor the GOP, each favorable ruling \u201cis an incremental step towards election integrity,\u201d said Steve Roberts, a partner at the law firm Holtzman Vogel, which represents Republicans in election fights. Voting rights advocates call such claims spurious \u2013 \u201cpure speculation\u201d and \u201ca messaging tool,\u201d said Sophia Lin Lakin, director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Voting Rights Project.\n\nElection officials across the political spectrum strenuously dispute allegations of pervasive problems with voting apparatuses at the state and local level. They say that baseless claims of mismanagement and voter fraud \u2013 which researchers have found is rare \u2013 are the bigger blow to the integrity of elections.\n\nWho Can Vote\n\nOf the cases tracked by Bloomberg, nearly one-third focus on who should be allowed to vote. The majority have been brought by Republicans or conservative groups seeking to limit access to the polls, chiefly by accusing states of failing to purge their rolls of ineligible voters.\n\nStates have hit back, accusing the challengers of cherry-picking data and casting aspersions on common and lawful voter roll maintenance practices. Many of these cases have been filed since July and are unlikely to wrap up by November \u2013 fueling criticism that they\u2019re primarily aimed at sowing mistrust, not securing tangible outcomes.\n\nDemocrats and left-leaning groups have focused their efforts on expanding, or ensuring, access to the polls. Civil rights groups led by the Alabama Coalition for Immigrant Justice sued to block a directive from Alabama\u2019s Republican Secretary of State Wes Allen to bar from voting more than 3,000 residents listed in a federal database of foreign nationals.\n\nAlabama\u2019s Republican Secretary of State Wes Allen. Photographer: Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nAllen has acknowledged that some of those people may have become citizens and therefore eligible to vote, others may have been listed by mistake; either way, they\u2019d have to prove it. The suit says the broad purge violates voter protections and the US Constitution and is in league with a \u201cnationwide, bad-faith effort\u201d to boost the false idea that non-citizens are voting in large numbers.\n\nThe US Department of Justice also sued Alabama. A federal judge hasn\u2019t ruled yet whether the 3,000 can remain eligible to vote while the cases proceed.\n\nOther eligibility cases have involved whether people with past felony convictions are allowed to vote and how states and counties handle challenges by outside third parties to the validity of voter registrations.\n\nHow Americans Vote\n\nThe Covid pandemic inspired a record 43% of American voters to cast an absentee ballot in 2020. While that fell in the 2022 midterms, it was still well above historic levels.\n\nThe new enthusiasm for remote voting continues to inspire lawsuits. The current fight over Wisconsin\u2019s use of ballot drop boxes resurfaced claims Republicans have been making since 2020, that the practice heightens the risk of fraud. State officials defend it as a secure, time-tested way to encourage voter participation.\n\nIn 2022, the Wisconsin Supreme Court barred the use of drop boxes; in July, a new and more liberal slate of justices reversed the earlier ban.\n\nResidents drop mail-in ballots in an official ballot box outside of a library in Milwaukee on Oct. 20, 2020. Photographer: Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nOf all the cases identified by Bloomberg since January 2023, more than a third were filed in August and September, suggesting a rush for resolution \u2013 or at least the public\u2019s attention \u2013 in the final weeks of the campaign.\n\nIn North Carolina, the RNC sued on Sept. 12 to block students and employees from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from showing their school-issued digital ID cards as proof of identity at the polls. A judge rejected the party\u2019s request on Sept. 20. But a week later, an appeals court reversed and said the digital cards couldn\u2019t be used.\n\nJudges are aware that last-minute decisions risk confusion among voters and could interfere with the administration of the election. There isn\u2019t a hard and fast rule for precisely how close to an election is too close for courts to act, leaving officials in limbo until cases finish moving through the legal system.\n\nWhich Ballots Count\n\nElection officials stress that no presidential contest is officially decided in the hours after polls close, no matter what news outlets say. More than half of all states accept at least some absentee ballots that arrive after Nov. 5. It\u2019s a practice that Republicans have gone to court to protest; appeals are pending after the GOP lost fights in Nevada and Mississippi.\n\nOther cases grapple with what happens when voters make mistakes on their ballots. Pennsylvania in particular, with its deadlocked polls and 19 electoral college votes, has become a hotbed for these types of fights.\n\nAn official poll watcher uses binoculars as workers count ballots for the 2020 presidential election at the Philadelphia Convention Center on Nov. 3, 2020. Photographer: Hannah Yoon/Bloomberg\n\nThe Supreme Court of Pennsylvania rebuffed several challenges to a state law that invalidates undated or misdated mail ballots, even if they arrive on time. Voting rights groups, with support from the DNC, say the rule has led to thousands of rejected votes in past cycles.\n\nThe state\u2019s high court also rejected a case brought by the RNC seeking to block counties from notifying voters about problems with their mail ballots and giving them an opportunity to fix them.\n\nIn 2020, people who voted for President Joe Biden were almost twice as likely to say they mailed in their ballots compared with Trump supporters, according to a Pew Research Center study.\n\nHow the Election Is Finalized\n\nA small but critical subset of cases involves the duty of local election officials to certify vote tallies \u2013 historically an uncontroversial, routine function with little room for independent action. The 2020 election changed that, as Trump\u2019s supporters in swing states explored options to delay or block his loss from being certified by states and Congress.\n\nThis election is the first major test of 2022 congressional legislation that established new deadlines and other processes for states to certify results in presidential contests. Deliberate, partisan foot-dragging could throw the enterprise into uncharted territory \u2013 and into court.\n\nElection workers in Fulton County began working through a recount of ballots in Atlanta on Nov. 14, 2020. Photographer: Hyosub Shin/Atlanta Journal-Constitution/AP Photo\n\nIn the spring, Julie Adams, a Republican member of the Fulton County, Georgia, election board, refused to certify the results of the presidential primary. Ultimately, her reservations were overruled by other members of the election board, but she sued to preemptively protect the ability of county officials to deny certification in November.\n\nA judge ruled against Adams on Oct. 15, writing that officials in her position must certify results. \u201cGeorgia voters would be silenced,\u201d he wrote, if election officers were \u201cfree to play investigator, prosecutor, jury and judge.\u201d\n\nDemocrats \u2013 concerned about a repeat scenario in the battleground state \u2013 are asking the same judge to block new rules adopted by the Republican-majority state election board that require election officials like Adams to conduct a \u201creasonable inquiry\u201d before they certify. The DNC is also suing over the state board\u2019s decision to require a hand count of ballots.\n\nUntil vote counts come in, it\u2019s impossible to know which issues in which states will trigger legal fights after Nov. 5. Ideally courts will dispatch as many cases as possible ahead of election day, says Rebecca Green, co-director of the Election Law Program at William & Mary Law School.\n\nThat\u2019s the best chance to allow judges \u2013 some of whom are elected partisans or federal jurists whose presidential appointment will inevitably be scrutinized \u2013 to retain the high ground, she said: \u201cYou\u2019re resolving these questions at least behind a veil of ignorance about who will benefit.\u201d",

        "text": "Public trust in U.S. elections is decreasing. But should it be?\nRecent polls show public trust in the integrity of U.S. elections is decreasing, largely among Republicans. But this doesn\u2019t signal that our elections are getting less reliable, UC Berkeley scholars said.\n\nIn fact, elections in the U.S. are more secure and the results are more accurate than 20 years ago, said David Wagner , a Berkeley professor of computer science. While experts agree there are significant ways to improve our technical voting systems, Wagner said the largest vulnerabilities to election results have nothing to do with how the public\u2019s votes are counted.\n\n\u201cToday, I think the biggest risk is the human element \u2013 disinformation, propaganda, the manipulation through the media, targeted efforts to try to get particular populations to vote or not vote and attempts by other countries to breed chaos or interfere in our election,\u201d said Wagner, who serves on the U.S. Election Assistance Commission\u2019s Technical Guidelines Development Committee that helps set certification requirements for voting machines.\n\nPublic trust in elections is an important pillar of a functioning democracy. Levels of trust can impact everything from levels of voter engagement to the likelihood of insurrection.\n\nPublic trust in elections is an important pillar of a functioning democracy. (Photo/ rawpixel.com / McKinsey)\n\nThrough a technical lens, U.S. elections are very secure, Wagner said. In the early 2000s, the technical risks of voting equipment getting hacked was high. Now, many risks have been partly or wholly resolved, he said.\n\nVoting machines must meet protective specifications, and a subset of the votes are audited manually in many states to ensure these systems tallied them accurately, Wagner said.\n\nStill, election processes also have problems, many of which vary by the state or local government that runs them, said Philip Stark , a professor of statistics at Berkeley.\n\nPeople disagree about whether ballot-marking devices are trustworthy enough to use to reliably and accurately record an individual's votes, Stark said. There are also issues confirming all votes have been counted, auditing votes after they\u2019re cast and grappling with insider threats, he said. These kinds of challenges were on display in the 2020 presidential election in Georgia.\n\n\u201cWe currently have what I would call \u2018faith-based\u2019 elections, where people are saying, \u2018Trust me that I did it right,\u2019\u201d said Stark, who invented risk-limiting audits , a method several states have codified into law for assessing whether the reported electoral outcomes are correct. \u201cWhat I think we should have instead is evidence-based elections , where instead of just saying, \u2018George Washington won,\u2019 the election official is required to provide convincing evidence that indeed George Washington won.\u201d\n\nDeepfake images and video are also a big problem, said James O\u2019Brien , a professor of computer science at Berkeley. The technology is improving rapidly, he said. It\u2019s becoming harder to differentiate maliciously manipulated images from real ones \u2013 even for experts like himself. These tools are also increasingly widely available, meaning more fakes are being shared, he said.\n\n\u201cWe're just going to have to accept the fact that if I show some image of whatever it is, that doesn't prove that it was real,\u201d said O\u2019Brien.\n\n\"We're just going to have to accept the fact that if I show some image of whatever it is, that doesn't prove that it was real,\" said James O'Brien.\n\nThis can have real consequences for trust in elections, O\u2019Brien said. It means the public must figure out what to believe, which may illustrate more about their existing biases than their ability to discern the truth, he said.\n\nThe most likely predictor for whether someone will trust an image is whether their own views align with that image, O\u2019Brien found in a 2021 study . Additionally, some people are prone to believe conspiracy theories and fake videos can offer the \u201cproof\u201d they need to validate those beliefs, he said.\n\n\u201cNow someone trying to manipulate others can take that underlying motivation to find the truth, which is actually a good one, and the manipulator can control people by showing them things that lead them off into some other direction that the manipulator wants,\u201d said O\u2019Brien. \u201cWe saw how this was done with text during the 2016 elections with Cambridge Analytica and how they were very effective at being able to manipulate people. This is like that, but even worse.\u201d\n\nComputer science and statistics experts have items they\u2019ll be watching to assess the strength and reliability in the 2024 election cycle. For Wagner, that includes seeing whether candidates cede the election if the results show they lost. He\u2019ll also look for the use and impacts of deepfakes, he said. And he will look for potential fraud in absentee ballots and for technical flaws, but he emphasized that these aren\u2019t major risks.\n\nFinally, Wagner will be on high alert for the political weaponization of science. He has watched \u201ca fairly arcane debate\u201d play out over the last two decades among technologists and election officials about the viability of the nation\u2019s voting machines that spurred technical analyses from advocates arguing both sides. He noted that science has \u201cbeen twisted\u201d into conspiracy theories to argue the election was stolen.\n\n\u201cIt's a positive thing that we have increased attention to elections and people want to make sure that they're trustworthy,\u201d said Wagner. \u201cBut also the risk is that science gets taken out of context and used to support a narrative that was never what the scientists were trying to say or that goes beyond what you can support with existing science.\"",

The article explored the CFPB's efforts to finalize cases before the upcoming presidential election, and highlighted the agency's aggressive approach under Director Rohit Chopra. Mr. DiResta provided insights on the CFPB's investigative methods and their impact on financial institutions.\"Obviously they're not shy about going after big banks, making big headlines, pushing the envelope substantively. But in the trenches, procedurally, I see them being very aggressive,\" he said.(Subscription required)",

Cyber adversaries, including state-sponsored actors and hacktivist groups, are increasingly active leading up to major events like elections. Remaining vigilant and identifying and analyzing potential cyberthreats and vulnerabilities is crucial for preparing and safeguarding against the lures and targeted cyberattacks that could take advantage of a heightened moment in time and even disrupt or influence electoral outcomes.\u201d\n\nNews Summary\n\nFortinet \u00ae (NASDAQ: FTNT), the global cybersecurity leader driving the convergence of networking and security, today released its FortiGuard Labs Threat Intelligence Report: Threat Actors Targeting the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election, which reveals and analyzes threats tied to U.S.-based entities, voters, and the electoral process. Key findings from the threat intelligence report include:\n\nPhishing Scams Targeting Voters Leading Up to the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election: Threat actors are selling affordable phishing kits on the darknet designed to target voters and donors by impersonating the presidential candidates and their campaigns.\n\nThreat actors are selling affordable phishing kits on the darknet designed to target voters and donors by impersonating the presidential candidates and their campaigns. Malicious Domain Registrations on the Rise: More than 1,000 new potentially malicious domains have also been registered since the beginning of 2024 that follow particular patterns and incorporate election-related content and candidates, suggesting that threat actors are leveraging the heightened interest surrounding the election to lure unsuspecting targets and potentially conduct malicious activities.\n\nMore than 1,000 new potentially malicious domains have also been registered since the beginning of 2024 that follow particular patterns and incorporate election-related content and candidates, suggesting that threat actors are leveraging the heightened interest surrounding the election to lure unsuspecting targets and potentially conduct malicious activities. Darknet Landscape: Billions of records from the U.S. are for sale on darknet forums, including Social Security numbers (SSNs), personally identifiable information (PII), and credentials that could be used in misinformation campaigns and lead to fraudulent activity, phishing scams, and account takeover; approximately 3% of the posts on darknet forums involve databases related to business and government entities.\n\nBillions of records from the U.S. are for sale on darknet forums, including Social Security numbers (SSNs), personally identifiable information (PII), and credentials that could be used in misinformation campaigns and lead to fraudulent activity, phishing scams, and account takeover; approximately of the posts on darknet forums involve databases related to business and government entities. Ransomware Landscape: FortiGuard Labs researchers noted a 28% increase in ransomware attacks against the U.S. government year-over-year based on observed leak sites.\n\nScams Targeting the U.S. 2024 Presidential Election Flood the Darknet\n\nCyber adversaries, including state-sponsored actors and hacktivist groups, are increasingly active in the lead-up to elections.\n\nThe FortiGuard Labs research team observed threat actors selling distinct phishing kits for $1,260 each, created to impersonate U.S. presidential candidates. These kits are designed to harvest personal information, including names, addresses, and credit card (donation) details.\n\nSince January 2024, FortiGuard Labs researchers have also identified more than 1,000 newly registered domain names that incorporate election-related terms and references to prominent political figures. Fraudulent fundraising websites, including secure[.]actsblues[.]com, meant to imitate the legitimate site for ActBlue (secure[.]actblue[.]com), a nonprofit American fundraising platform and political action committee.\n\nThe top two most-used hosting providers for these election-themed websites are AMAZON-02 and CLOUDFLARENET. The reliance on major hosting platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Cloudflare suggests that threat actors are leveraging these reputable services to enhance the legitimacy and resilience of their malicious domains.\n\nA notable concentration of domains is associated with a limited number of IP addresses, indicating a centralized approach by threat actors to efficiently manage multiple malicious domains to execute large-scale cyber campaigns.\n\nNo Shortage of Personal Data Being Sold Aimed at the U.S.\n\nFortiGuard Labs analysis continues to show a significant number of diverse databases available on darknet forums targeting the U.S., including SSNs, usernames, email addresses, passwords, credit card data, date of birth, and other PII that could be used to challenge the integrity of the 2024 U.S. election. Specific highlights include:\n\nOver 1.3 billion rows of combo lists, which include usernames, email addresses, and passwords, signify a considerable risk for credential-stuffing attacks. In such attacks, cybercriminals use these stolen credentials to gain unauthorized access to accounts, making it a valid and substantial security concern.\n\nThe discovery of 300,000 rows of credit card data, which include CVV, name, card number, expiration date, and date of birth, highlights potential financial fraud risks targeting voters and election officials.\n\nOver 2 billion rows of user databases on the darknet indicate a heightened exposure to identity theft and targeted phishing attacks.\n\n10% of the posts on darknet forums are associated with SSN databases, which poses a significant threat by increasing the risk of personal data breaches.\n\nThe U.S. Government Is an Increasingly Attractive Target\n\nRansomware attacks targeting government agencies before an election can impact the electoral process and public trust in government institutions. Compared to 2023, the FortiGuard Labs research team observed a 28% spike in ransomware attacks against the U.S. government in 2024.\n\nThe darknet has become a hub for U.S.-specific threats, where malicious actors trade sensitive information and can potentially develop strategies to exploit vulnerabilities. Approximately 3% of the posts on these forums involve databases related to business and government entities. These databases hold critical organizational data that is vulnerable to cyber exploits and are a prime target for threat actors as the elections come and go.\n\nRecommendations to Prevent and Mitigate Cyberattacks this Election Season\n\nCybersecurity measures are critical to safeguard the integrity of the U.S. 2024 presidential election. Following fundamental best practices can help prevent and mitigate the effects of cyber incidents. The full list of recommendations and best practices can be found in the report, but some key takeaways for citizens, business leaders, and election officials include:\n\nAlways remain vigilant for suspicious behavior or activity leading up to major events and prioritize good cyber hygiene.\n\nPrioritize employee training and awareness.\n\nEnforce multi-factor authentication and a strong-password policy.\n\nInstall endpoint protection solutions.\n\nPatch operating systems and web servers and update software regularly.\n\n\n\nAbout the Fortinet FortiGuard Labs Election Security Report\n\nThis report provides an in-depth analysis of threats observed from January 2024 to August 2024. It examines the diverse array of cyberthreats that may affect U.S.-based entities and the electoral process.\n\n\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nAbout Fortinet\n\nFortinet (NASDAQ: FTNT) is a driving force in the evolution of cybersecurity and the convergence of networking and security.

A long-time election volunteer and former clerk in the Wisconsin village of Alma Center, she is well-versed in election law, including the routine requirement to invite the public to watch tests of voting machines. Usually, nothing happens. No member of the public had actually taken up such an invitation, she said \u2013 until one man showed up during the most recent test on 1 August. \u201cHe had just moved into the area and he was belligerent, angry,\u201d Ms Burlingame said. The middle-aged man started taking pictures and asking questions \u2013 how did the machines work? Were the machines connected to the internet? (They weren\u2019t, but he insisted on being shown the internet connections). \u201cThese are the machines that changed everyone\u2019s votes,\u201d the man said, repeating a widely spread and debunked conspiracy theory about a particular brand of voting machine. \u201cI said, \u2018There\u2019s no way they can do that\u2019,\u201d Ms Burlingame recalls. \u201cHe was not happy with me.\u201d Eventually the man left, but the incident gave her pause. \u201cIt made me nervous. I wasn't afraid\u2026 but it did make me stop and think, what is the election going to be like? Are we going to have more of this?\u201d Election polls - is Harris or Trump ahead?\n\nCan illegal immigrants really vote in US? Incidents like the one in Alma Center, a village of around 500 people in largely rural Jackson County in western Wisconsin, have become increasingly common throughout the country in recent years, experts say. As a result, officials are preparing for another high-stakes election on 5 November by bolstering security to keep workers safe at polling places. They are also working to protect against possible intimidation of voters or tampering with the voting process. Threats against election workers have increased since the 2020 presidential election which Donald Trump and his allies falsely claimed to have won. Conspiracy theories about the voting process led to threats against election workers, and culminated in the 6 January 2021 riot at the US Capitol. Now, suspicion about elections has become so pervasive that it has moved well beyond urban areas with large vote-counting operations and crept into places like Jackson County. Wisconsin is a battleground state which President Joe Biden won by fewer than 21,000 votes four years ago. Election workers are on the front lines.\n\nBBC / Mike Wendling Jackson County election workers are sworn in during a training session\n\nA survey earlier this year by the Brennan Center, a non-partisan but left-leaning think tank, found 38% of local election officials had experienced threats, harassment or abuse. More than half were concerned about the safety of their colleagues or staff, a level of anxiety that has remained more or less constant since the 2022 midterm elections. \u201cPeople are scared,\u201d says Melissa Kono, the elected town clerk in Burnside, Wisconsin. Ms Kono travels around Wisconsin delivering state-mandated election training to volunteer poll workers. She says the kinds of scenarios she\u2019s being asked about have changed dramatically over the last five years, to the point where she\u2019s increasingly included material in her sessions about dealing with threats. \u201cI\u2019m concerned for the clerks and the election workers,\u201d she said.\n\nMs Kono told the BBC that she and other elections officials are considering scenarios that were unthinkable just a few years ago, such as planning for active shooters at voting places. Her handouts to local workers now include a list of emergency numbers, useful in the case of extreme weather and natural disasters, but also threats of violence. \u201cWhen people perceive the stakes as being very high, they're willing to do extreme actions in order to win,\u201d she said during a break in one of the sessions at the courthouse in Black River Falls which, with a population of 3,500, is the largest settlement in Jackson County. \u201cIt's one thing to prepare workers for the things that are in the election day manual, such as, how do you process absentee ballots? What are the photo ID requirements? \u201cBut it's all these things that I just can't even anticipate,\u201d she said. \u201cI worry that I didn't prepare them to be safe.\u201d\n\nBBC / Mike Wendling Concerns about election threats have moved from big cities into small towns like Black River Falls\n\nMs Kono and other election officials\u2019 shared their concerns as the threat of further political violence looms over this year\u2019s election. Donald Trump himself narrowly escaped an assassination attempt on his life in Pennsylvania in July, and avoided a second attempt at his golf course in Florida in September. Among other incidents, elections officials have been sent white powder in the post, and have been subjected to \u201cswatting\u201d \u2013 anonymous emergency calls about fictional crimes, designed to draw armed police into people\u2019s homes. At the same time, Trump and his allies have continued to sow doubts about the integrity of the US voting system, which is marked by a patchwork of rules, regulations and methods, making November\u2019s vote less of a national ballot than an interlocking network of thousands of local elections. In 2016, he said \u2013 with no real evidence - that millions of votes had been fraudulently cast, but the conspiracy theories reached a fever pitch in 2020, when the Covid pandemic prompted many states to change laws to make it easier to vote early and by mail or absentee ballot. Although the 2022 midterms were mostly peaceful, experts say false information about elections has persisted and has the potential to instigate disruption or even violence. \u201cWhen I served as an election official, I didn't receive death threats,\u201d says Elizabeth Howard, a director at the Brennan Center and a former deputy commissioner of elections in Virginia. Ms Howard said the nearly two-fifths of election workers facing threats represent \u201cvery concerning numbers\u201d. \u201cNot surprisingly, these threats are leading to election officials leaving the profession,\u201d she said. In 2021 the US justice department set up a task force to investigate threats against election workers, and has since examined more than 2,000 threats. But only a small number of cases \u2013 20, at the last count \u2013 have resulted in criminal charges. Ms Howard noted that recent threats are not a partisan issue, with the vast majority of election officials taking steps to increase security since 2020.\n\nThe most common measure being taken is collaborating with law enforcement, she said, but some polling places have installed panic buttons, bullet-resistant glass panels or electronic security measures. \u201cElection officials on both sides of the aisle have been threatened,\u201d she said. That includes Republican Bill Gates \u2013 no relation to the Microsoft founder \u2013 who as supervisor of Maricopa County, Arizona, found himself on the receiving end of threats in 2020 and 2022. \u201cIt's something that people talk about all the time,\u201d he said, noting that people have been spotted taking pictures of election workers and their licence plates outside the county tabulation centre in the state\u2019s largest city, Phoenix. \u201cPeople are still questioning the 2020 election almost every day,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cIf you take a look at my X account, it\u2019s just constant. \u201cI\u2019ll type something like \u2018I had a sandwich today\u2019 and (someone will respond) \u2018You stole the election in 2020\u2019.\u201d \u201cIt shouldn't be like this,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople who are in elections should not be subjected to this vitriol, to the insults\u2026 it's just crazy.\u201d Gates suffered from post-traumatic stress and for a variety of reasons is not running for re-election as Maricopa supervisor this year.\n\nGetty Images Bill Gates, the Republican supervisor of Maricopa County, Arizona, found himself the target of threats\n\nBack in Wisconsin, around 50 Jackson County election volunteers crowded into a courthouse room lightly adorned with paintings and prints of local rural scenes to attend one of Ms Kono\u2019s training sessions in early October. \u201cNo one is allowed to be disruptive,\u201d she told them, explaining the regulations around partisan poll watchers, or \u201celection observers\u201d as they are called in Wisconsin. \u201cObservers have some rules they have to follow\u201d \u2013 they can\u2019t wear buttons or hats in support of a candidate, and they have to stay in a designated area. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to make them comfortable, right?\u201d one volunteer asked. \u201cI don\u2019t think the election manual says,\u201d Ms Kono responded, smiling as chuckles broke out around the room. \u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t feed them.\u201d There are dozens of slides on election procedures and rules, and talk to threats and security. Ms Kono explained the difference between a \u201ctrue threat\u201d \u2013 threatening an election official is illegal in Wisconsin \u2013 and an angry, but legal, comment. She distributed the packets that she had prepared with local emergency contacts and other useful phone numbers. \u201cYou should really be aware of a lot of things on election day,\u201d she told the group. Not everyone in Black River Falls is so worried about the safety of election workers.\n\nBBC / Mike Wendling The county headquarters of the Republican Party in Black River Falls\n\nIn the local Republican County office, a short walk down Main Street, Republican county chairman Bill Laurent was more sanguine. \u201cThis is the kind of place where you go to the polls and the workers will have a cookie or a piece of cake for you,\u201d he said. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard of much trouble.\u201d But reflecting the views of national party leadership, Mr Laurent said he was not confident that voting would be fair beyond Jackson County \u2013 citing in particular his fears of dirty tricks in Democratic strongholds in Wisconsin\u2019s two biggest cities, Madison and Milwaukee. Meanwhile the potential for escalating threats to affect voting was playing on the minds of several of the volunteers here, including Ms Burlingame, who dealt with the aggressive voting machine sceptic in August. Prior to 2020, she said, she would have put the chances of disruption on election day near zero. \u201cNow I think it's kind of four or five,\u201d on a ten-point scale, she said. \u201cI don't think anything's going to happen, but I'm not going to have a blind eye,\u201d she said. \u201cThere's just some people that I just don't feel I could trust, and that scares me.\u201d With reporting by Kayleen Devlin",

Kennedy Jr., Libertarian Party candidate Chase Oliver, Green Party candidate Jill Stein, and independent Cornel West, Harris receives 44% and Trump 41%. Kennedy is supported by 9%, Oliver receives 2%, Stein is the choice of 1%, and West wins 2%, among likely voters. Kennedy, who suspended his campaign, and the other third-party candidates are not on all state ballots.\n\nIn voting for Congress, 51% of likely voters say they will vote for the Democratic candidate and 49% will vote for the Republican candidate.\n\nWhen asked who they think is likely to win in November, 53% say Harris will definitely or probably win, while 47% say Trump will definitely or probably win.\n\nThe survey was conducted Oct. 1-10, 2024, interviewing 886 registered voters nationwide, with a margin of error of +/-4.3 percentage points. For likely voters, the sample size is 699, with a margin of error of +/-4.7 percentage points. (All results in the tables are stated as percentages.)\n\nPerceptions of presidential and vice-presidential candidates\n\nHarris is seen favorably by 47% and unfavorably by 52% of registered voters, with 2% saying they haven\u2019t heard enough. In July, 47% had a favorable view and 50% an unfavorable view of Harris, while 3% hadn\u2019t heard enough. The full trend of Harris favorability is shown in Table 1. The net favorability rating for Harris in Marquette Law School national polling has been much better for her since she became the candidate for president than during most of her earlier vice presidency.\n\nTable 1: Harris favorability trend\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nPoll dates Opinion Net Favorable Unfavorable Haven't heard enough 10/1-10/24 -5 47 52 2 7/24-8/1/24 -3 47 50 3 5/6-15/24 -24 35 59 6 3/18-28/24 -25 35 60 5 2/5-15/24 -19 37 56 7 11/2-7/23 -26 34 60 6 9/18-25/23 -20 37 57 6 7/7-12/23 -25 33 58 9 5/8-18/23 -26 32 58 10 3/13-22/23 -21 33 54 13 1/9-20/23 -21 35 56 9 11/15-22/22 -16 36 52 12 9/7-14/22 -15 38 53 9 1/10-21/22 -14 37 51 12 11/1-10/21 -8 39 47 14 Marquette Law School Poll, national surveys, latest: Oct. 1-10, 2024 Question: Do you have a favorable or an unfavorable opinion of the following people or haven\u2019t you heard enough yet to have an opinion?\n\nIn October, Trump is seen favorably by 44% and unfavorably by 55%, while 1% are without an opinion. In July, his favorability was 45% and unfavorability 53%, with 1% lacking an opinion. The full trend for Trump favorability since 2021 is shown in Table 2. Trump\u2019s net favorability hit a low point in January 2022 at -37 but has improved steadily in 2023 and 2024.\n\nTable 2: Trump favorability trend\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nPoll dates Opinion Net Favorable Unfavorable Haven't heard enough 10/1-10/24 -11 44 55 1 7/24-8/1/24 -8 45 53 1 5/6-15/24 -17 41 58 1 3/18-28/24 -13 43 56 1 2/5-15/24 -9 45 54 1 11/2-7/23 -15 42 57 2 9/18-25/23 -15 42 57 1 7/7-12/23 -28 35 63 2 5/8-18/23 -21 38 59 2 3/13-22/23 -29 34 63 2 1/9-20/23 -26 36 62 2 11/15-22/22 -36 31 67 1 9/7-14/22 -30 34 64 2 7/5-12/22 -27 35 62 3 5/9-19/22 -23 37 60 2 3/14-24/22 -22 38 60 2 1/10-21/22 -37 31 68 1 11/1-10/21 -34 32 66 2 Marquette Law School Poll, national surveys, latest: Oct. 1-10, 2024 Question: Do you have a favorable or an unfavorable opinion of the following people or haven\u2019t you heard enough yet to have an opinion?\n\nPresident Joe Biden remains an unpopular figure, with more negative ratings than either Harris or Trump. His net favorability was only slightly negative at the end of 2021 and the beginning of 2022. Since that time, he has received net negative ratings near -20 in most Marquette Law School national polls. In the new poll, 39% have a favorable opinion and 60% have an unfavorable opinion of Biden, for a -21 favorability. The full trend for Biden since November 2021 is shown in Table 3.\n\nTable 3: Biden favorability trend\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nPoll dates Opinion Net Favorable Unfavorable Haven't heard enough 10/1-10/24 -21 39 60 1 7/24-8/1/24 -16 42 58 1 5/6-15/24 -21 39 60 1 3/18-28/24 -20 40 60 1 2/5-15/24 -20 40 60 1 11/2-7/23 -19 40 59 1 9/18-25/23 -21 39 60 1 7/7-12/23 -17 41 58 1 5/8-18/23 -23 37 60 3 3/13-22/23 -15 41 56 3 1/9-20/23 -11 43 54 2 11/15-22/22 -6 46 52 3 9/7-14/22 -9 44 53 2 7/5-12/22 -26 35 61 3 5/9-19/22 -17 40 57 3 3/14-24/22 -10 44 54 2 1/10-21/22 -6 46 52 3 11/1-10/21 -5 45 50 5 Marquette Law School Poll, national surveys, latest: Oct. 1-10, 2024 Question: Do you have a favorable or an unfavorable opinion of the following people or haven\u2019t you heard enough yet to have an opinion?\n\nThe percentage of voters with unfavorable opinions of both candidates, the so-called \u201cdouble haters,\u201d increased slightly from late July, but remains well below the levels in the spring when Biden was the Democratic candidate and Harris his running mate. For Harris and Trump, 12% are unfavorable to both in October, a slight increase from July\u2019s 10%. By contrast, 21% were unfavorable to both Trump and Harris in May. The trend since November 2023 is shown in Table 4. Since Harris became the Democratic presidential candidate, slightly more people are favorable to her and unfavorable to Trump than those unfavorable to Harris and favorable to Trump. From March 2023 through May 2024, more were favorable to Trump and unfavorable to Harris.\n\nTable 4: Trend in those unfavorable to both Harris and Trump\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nPoll dates Opinion Fav Harris, Fav Trump Fav Harris, Unfav Trump Unfav Harris, Fav Trump Unfav Harris, Unfav Trump DK either 10/1-10/24 3 43 40 12 2 7/24-8/1/24 4 43 39 10 5 5/6-15/24 2 33 38 21 6 3/18-28/24 3 32 38 21 6 2/5-15/24 3 34 39 17 7 11/2-7/23 3 30 37 23 7 9/18-25/23 4 32 35 22 7 7/7-12/23 1 31 32 25 10 5/8-18/23 1 30 33 24 11 3/13-22/23 1 30 31 23 15 1/9-20/23 1 34 33 22 10 11/15-22/22 1 35 28 23 13 9/7-14/22 2 35 31 21 11 1/10-21/22 1 35 28 22 13 11/1-10/21 2 36 28 18 16 Marquette Law School Poll, national surveys, latest: Oct. 1-10, 2024 Question: Do you have a favorable or an unfavorable opinion of the following people or haven\u2019t you heard enough yet to have an opinion?\n\nRepublican vice-presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance is seen favorably by 35% and unfavorably by 47%, with 18% saying they haven\u2019t heard enough or don\u2019t know. In July, he was seen favorably by 29% and unfavorably by 45%, with 25% saying they haven\u2019t heard enough or don\u2019t know.\n\nDemocratic vice-presidential candidate Gov. Tim Walz is seen favorably by 39% and unfavorably by 39%, while 23% haven\u2019t heard enough about him. This is the first time favorability to Walz has been asked.\n\nCharacteristics of Harris and Trump\n\nRespondents are asked how well a number of phrases describe both Harris and Trump. Trump is seen as having a stronger record of accomplishments than Harris and has a slight advantage on being a strong leader. Trump is seen as too old to be president by a majority, while few see Harris that way. Trump is also seen by more than 60% as having behaved corruptly, a phrase 38% say describes Harris.\n\nHarris is described as sharing the respondents\u2019 values by a slightly larger percentage than viewed Trump that way, and, by larger margins, Harris is also seen as intelligent and with the right temperament to be president compared to those who see Trump in these ways. All these perceptions are shown in Table 5.\n\nTable 5: How well does this phrase describe Harris or Trump\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nCandidate How well phrase describes Very/somewhat well Not too/not at all well Strong record of accomplishments Harris 43 57 Trump 53 47 Is a strong leader Harris 51 49 Trump 54 46 Is too old to be president Harris 13 87 Trump 59 41 Has behaved corruptly Harris 38 62 Trump 61 39 Shares your values Harris 50 50 Trump 45 55 Is intelligent Harris 62 38 Trump 50 50 Has the right temperament to be president Harris 59 41 Trump 38 62 Marquette Law School Poll, national survey, Oct. 1-10, 2024 Question: How well does each of the following phrases describe (Kamala Harris)(Donald Trump)?\n\nWhich candidate is better on issues\n\nTable 6 shows which candidate is thought to do a better job on each of eight issues. Trump is seen as better on immigration and border security, the economy, and the Israel-Hamas war, and holds a slight edge on handling foreign relations. Harris has her largest advantage on abortion policy, followed by health care, Medicare & Social Security, and ensuring fair and accurate elections.\n\nDespite the campaign, the debate, and news coverage of the candidates, between 12% and 26% of registered voters say both candidates would be about the same or that neither would be good on each issue.\n\nTable 6: Which candidate would do a better job on issues\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nIssue Who better Harris Trump Both about the same Neither good Immigration and border security 36 51 6 6 The economy 36 51 7 5 Israel-Hamas war in Gaza 32 42 12 14 Foreign relations 41 45 7 7 Ensuring fair and accurate elections 45 33 11 10 Medicare & Social Security 46 34 13 7 Health care 48 33 11 8 Abortion policy 53 30 9 8 Marquette Law School Poll, national survey, Oct. 1-10, 2024 Question: Do you think Kamala Harris or Donald Trump would do a better job handling each of the following issues, they are both about the same or would neither be good on the issue?\n\nMost important issues\n\nRespondents were asked which of the eight issues would be most important for deciding their vote. The economy is the top-rated issue, followed by immigration, with abortion policy the third most important issue, as shown in Table 7.\n\nTable 7: Most important issues\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nResponse Percent The economy 40 Immigration and border security 15 Abortion policy 12 Medicare & Social Security 8 Ensuring fair and accurate elections 8 Health care 5 Foreign relations 2 Israel-Hamas war in Gaza 2 Don't know 7 Marquette Law School Poll, national survey, Oct. 1-10, 2024 Question: Which one of the following issues will be MOST important in deciding your vote for president?\n\nPartisans differ on the most important issues, though all rank the economy as most important. Republicans are much more likely to rank the economy and immigration as most important, while placing little weight on any of the other issues. Independents rank the economy as most important with immigration and abortion policy tied for second most important. Democrats put the economy first, followed by abortion policy, for their top concerns. Ensuring fair elections and Medicare & Social Security tied for third most important among Democrats. Only 3% of Democrats rank immigration as their top issue. The full results are shown in Table 8.\n\nTable 8: Most important issues, by party identification\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nParty ID Issue The economy Immigration and border security Health care Foreign relations Abortion policy Medicare & Social Security The war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza Ensuring fair and accurate elections Don't know Republican 50 29 2 2 4 3 2 3 4 Independent 42 9 8 3 9 6 4 0 18 Democrat 30 3 7 3 20 14 2 14 8 Marquette Law School Poll, national survey, Oct. 1-10, 2024 Question: Which one of the following issues will be MOST important in deciding your vote for president?\n\nEconomic conditions, direction of the country, and personal financial situation\n\nThe public has on balance negative views of the economy, the direction of the country, and their personal financial situation. Views of the economy and financial situations have not changed appreciably over the past year. The economy is seen as excellent by only 4%, as good by 24%, as not so good by 42%, and as poor by 30%. The full trend since November 2023 is shown in Table 9.\n\nTable 9: Views of the national economy\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nPoll dates National economy Excellent Good Not so good Poor 10/1-10/24 4 24 42 30 7/24-8/1/24 4 30 33 33 5/6-15/24 3 28 38 31 3/18-28/24 5 28 38 29 2/5-15/24 6 29 40 25 11/2-7/23 3 24 40 33 Marquette Law School Poll, national surveys, latest: Oct. 1-10, 2024 Question: How would you describe the state of the nation's economy these days?\n\nA substantial majority (79%) say the country is off on the wrong track, while 21% say it is headed in the right direction. Trend data for this question are not available.\n\nRespondents\u2019 family financial situation is virtually the same as it was a year ago: 38% say they are living comfortably, 43% say they are just getting by, and 19% say they are struggling. This trend is shown in Table 10.\n\nTable 10: Family financial situation\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nPoll dates Financial situation Living comfortably Just getting by Struggling 10/1-10/24 38 43 19 7/24-8/1/24 38 41 21 5/6-15/24 40 42 18 3/18-28/24 46 38 16 2/5-15/24 42 41 17 11/2-7/23 39 43 19 Marquette Law School Poll, national surveys, latest: Oct. 1-10, 2024 Question: Thinking about your family's financial situation, would you say you are living comfortably, just getting by, or struggling to make ends meet?\n\nImmigration policy\n\nImmigration and border security has consistently been the second-most important issue for voters in 2024. The details of public opinion on immigrants in the United States illegally depend a great deal on how the question is framed. In the Marquette Law School Poll\u2019s national surveys, the issue has been asked three different ways.\n\nIn March and October, one question was worded as follows:\n\nWhich comes closest to your view about undocumented immigrants who are currently working in the U.S.? -- They should be allowed to stay in their jobs and to eventually apply for U.S. citizenship -- They should be allowed to stay in their jobs only as temporary guest workers but not to apply for U.S. citizenship -- They should be required to leave their jobs and leave the U.S.\n\nIn the current poll, 53% favor undocumented immigrants being able to stay in jobs and eventually apply for citizenship, with 18% saying they should stay only as guest workers but not be able to apply for citizenship, and 29% saying they should leave their jobs and the country. There was an increase in support for a path to citizenship between the March and October polls, as shown in Table 11.\n\nTable 11: Undocumented immigrants currently in U.S.\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nPoll dates Policy preference They should be allowed to stay in their jobs and to eventually apply for U.S. citizenship They should be allowed to stay in their jobs only as temporary guest workers but not to apply for U.S. citizenship They should be required to leave their jobs and leave the U.S. 10/1-10/24 53 18 29 3/18-28/24 41 25 34 Marquette Law School Poll, national surveys, latest: Oct. 1-10, 2024 Question: Which comes closest to your view about undocumented immigrants who are currently working in the U.S.?\n\nSince February, respondents were given one of two versions of a question about whether they favor deporting illegal immigrants. Support for deporting immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally, without mention of employment or length of residence, has been substantial throughout the year but has trended downward since first asked in February.\n\nDo you favor or oppose deporting immigrants who are living in the United States illegally back to their home countries?\n\nWith this wording, 58% favor deportation and 42% are opposed. When first asked in February, 68% favored deportations and 32% were opposed. The full trend is shown in Table 12.\n\nTable 12: Deport immigrants illegally in U.S.\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nPoll dates Favor or oppose Favor Oppose 10/1-10/24 58 42 7/24-8/1/24 61 39 5/6-15/24 64 36 3/18-28/24 63 37 2/5-15/24 68 32 Marquette Law School Poll, national surveys, latest: Oct. 1-10, 2024 Question: Do you favor or oppose deporting immigrants who are living in the United States illegally back to their home countries?\n\nAn alternative question wording, asked since May of a different half of the respondents from those asked the previous question, includes mention of those who have lengthy residency, jobs, and no criminal record:\n\nDo you favor or oppose deporting immigrants who are living in the United States illegally back to their home countries even if they have lived here for a number of years, have jobs and no criminal record?\n\nWhen worded this way, 40% favor deportations and 60% are opposed. Mention of residence, jobs, and no criminal record thus reduces support for deportations by around 20 percentage points, compared to the wording without additional description. The trend for this question, asked since May, is shown in Table 13. Support for deportations has declined over time with this wording, as well.\n\nTable 13: Deport immigrants illegally in U.S., including long-time residents with jobs etc.\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nPoll dates Favor or oppose Favor Oppose 10/1-10/24 40 60 7/24-8/1/24 45 55 5/6-15/24 48 52 Marquette Law School Poll, national surveys, latest: Oct. 1-10, 2024 Question: Do you favor or oppose deporting immigrants who are living in the United States illegally back to their home countries even if they have lived here for a number of years, have jobs and no criminal record?\n\nAbortion policy\n\nIn October, 61% oppose the 2022 Supreme Court decision overturning the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling, which had made abortion legal in all states, while 39% favor that recent decision. More than 60% have opposed the 2022 decision over the past year, as shown in Table 14.\n\nTable 14: Favor or oppose overturning Roe v. Wade\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nPoll dates Favor or oppose Favor Oppose 10/1-10/24 39 61 7/24-8/1/24 32 68 2/5-15/24 36 64 11/2-7/23 35 65 Marquette Law School Poll, national surveys, latest: Oct. 1-10, 2024 Question: [In 2022, the Supreme Court overturned Roe versus Wade, thus striking down the 1973 decision that made abortion legal in all 50 states.] How much do you favor or oppose this decision?\n\nIdeological perceptions of the candidates\n\nBoth presidential candidates are seen as more ideologically extreme than voters see themselves. Among all registered voters, 32% describe themselves as having \u201cmoderate\u201d political views, 16% say their views are \u201cvery conservative,\u201d and 11% say they are \u201cvery liberal.\u201d\n\nAmong registered voters, 19% see Harris as moderate, while 13% see Trump as moderate. Equal percentages see Trump as very conservative, 46%, and Harris as very liberal, 46%. These perceptions are shown in Table 15.\n\nTable 15: Ideological perceptions of candidates and self\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nPerception of Perceived ideology Very conservative Somewhat conservative Moderate Somewhat liberal Very liberal Harris 4 3 19 29 46 Trump 46 34 13 3 5 Self-perception 16 25 32 16 11 Marquette Law School Poll, national survey, Oct. 1-10, 2024 Question: In general, would you describe each of the following as\u2026? Question: Generally speaking, how would you describe your political views?\n\nEnthusiasm and likelihood of voting\n\nEnthusiasm about voting in November increased sharply from May to July, as shown in Table 16. It has changed little since July. In the current survey, 54% say they are very enthusiastic about voting.\n\nTable 16: Enthusiasm to vote in November election\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nPoll dates Enthusiasm Very enthusiastic Somewhat enthusiastic Not too enthusiastic Not at all enthusiastic 10/1-10/24 54 25 14 7 7/24-8/1/24 54 26 14 6 5/6-15/24 43 26 21 10 3/18-28/24 37 28 26 9 2/5-15/24 41 33 19 7 11/2-7/23 42 32 21 5 Marquette Law School Poll, national surveys, latest: Oct. 1-10, 2024 Question: How enthusiastic are you about voting in the elections in November 2024 for president and other offices? Would you say you are very, somewhat, not too, or not at all enthusiastic?\n\nEnthusiasm has increased substantially among Democrats, with a small increase among Republicans. Republicans had a consistent enthusiasm advantage over Democrats in polls before July, but that has been erased now, as shown in Table 17. Independents have a quite low level of enthusiasm, and the percent of independents who said they were very enthusiastic fell from 24% in July to 16% in October.\n\nTable 17: Enthusiasm to vote in November election, by party identification\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nPoll dates Enthusiasm Very enthusiastic Somewhat enthusiastic Not too enthusiastic Not at all enthusiastic Democrat 10/1-10/24 58 25 13 5 7/24-8/1/24 55 26 15 5 5/6-15/24 34 31 24 11 3/18-28/24 35 27 31 8 2/5-15/24 34 33 25 8 11/2-7/23 36 34 23 7 Independent 10/1-10/24 16 29 31 24 7/24-8/1/24 24 21 29 26 5/6-15/24 20 15 33 32 3/18-28/24 18 30 25 26 2/5-15/24 21 32 27 20 11/2-7/23 20 36 33 10 Republican 10/1-10/24 56 24 13 7 7/24-8/1/24 58 27 11 4 5/6-15/24 55 22 16 6 3/18-28/24 43 29 21 7 2/5-15/24 52 33 12 4 11/2-7/23 54 28 16 2 Marquette Law School Poll, national surveys, latest: Oct. 1-10, 2024 Question: (2024) How enthusiastic are you about voting in the elections in November 2024 for president and other offices? Would you say you are very, somewhat, not too, or not at all enthusiastic?\n\nThe race is very tight among the very and somewhat enthusiastic, with a slight Harris edge. Trump has an edge among those who are not too or not at all enthusiastic, as shown in Table 18.\n\nTable 18: Vote for Harris or Trump, by enthusiasm\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nEnthusiasm Vote choice 2024 Harris Trump Someone else Wouldn't vote Very enthusiastic 50 48 2 0 Somewhat enthusiastic 49 46 4 0 Not too/Not at all enthusiastic 34 39 15 11 Marquette Law School Poll, national survey, Oct. 1-10, 2024 Question: If the 2024 election for president were held today between [Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democrat,] and [former President Donald Trump, the Republican,] would you vote for [Kamala Harris] or for [Donald Trump]? Question: How enthusiastic are you about voting in the elections in November 2024 for president and other offices? Would you say you are very, somewhat, not too, or not at all enthusiastic?\n\nConfidence in elections\n\nLooking back at the 2020 presidential election, 60% are very or somewhat confident that votes were accurately cast and counted, while 40% are not too or not at all confident. There has been little change in these opinions since 2021, as shown in Table 19.\n\nTable 19: Confidence in accuracy of 2020 election\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nPoll dates Confidence Very/somewhat confident Not too/not at all confident 10/1-10/24 60 40 2/5-15/24 58 42 11/2-7/23 56 44 9/18-25/23 60 40 7/7-12/23 64 36 1/9-20/23 61 38 11/15-22/22 68 32 9/7-14/22 64 36 7/5-12/22 61 39 5/9-19/22 58 41 3/14-24/22 63 37 1/10-21/22 66 34 11/1-10/21 64 36 9/7-16/21 61 39 Marquette Law School Poll, national surveys, latest: Oct. 1-10, 2024 Question: How confident are you that, across the country, the votes for president were accurately cast and counted in the 2020 election?\n\nRepublicans remain far less confident in the accuracy of the 2020 election than are independents or Democrats, a fact that has changed little over the past four years. The results in the current poll are shown in Table 20.\n\nTable 20: Confidence in 2020 accuracy, by party identification\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nParty ID Confidence Very/somewhat confident Not too/not at all confident Republican 33 67 Independent 57 43 Democrat 89 11 Marquette Law School Poll, national survey, Oct. 1-10, 2024 Question: How confident are you that, across the country, the votes for president were accurately cast and counted in the 2020 election?\n\nLooking to this November\u2019s election, 65% are very or somewhat confident that the votes will be accurately cast and counted, with 35% are not too or not at all confident in the accuracy of the voting. This is slightly more confidence than currently expressed in the 2020 election (see Table 19 above). The partisan divide is also quite substantial. Though Republicans remain skeptical, they currently express more confidence in the upcoming election than in the previous one. Table 21 shows the views about the upcoming election.\n\nTable 21: Confidence in 2024 accuracy, by party identification\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nParty ID Confidence Very/somewhat confident Not too/not at all confident Republican 44 56 Independent 59 41 Democrat 88 12 Marquette Law School Poll, national survey, Oct. 1-10, 2024 Question: How confident are you that, across the country, the votes for president will be accurately cast and counted in the 2024 election?\n\nBiden and Trump presidential job approval\n\nBiden\u2019s job approval in October stands at 39% with disapproval at 61%, unchanged since July. Table 22 shows the recent trend in job approval.\n\nTable 22: Biden job approval\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nPoll dates Job approval Total approve Total disapprove Strongly approve Somewhat approve Somewhat disapprove Strongly disapprove 10/1-10/24 39 61 14 25 18 43 7/24-8/1/24 39 61 16 23 19 42 5/6-15/24 40 60 13 27 17 44 3/18-28/24 40 60 12 27 14 46 2/5-15/24 38 62 12 26 18 43 11/2-7/23 40 60 13 26 16 45 Marquette Law School Poll, national surveys, latest: Oct. 1-10, 2024 Question: Overall, do you approve or disapprove of the way Joe Biden is handling his job as president?\n\nRespondents were also asked about whether they approved of the job Trump did when he was president. In October, 50% approved and 50% disapproved. Trump\u2019s job approval has increased slightly in the poll since May. The recent trend is shown in Table 23.\n\nTable 23: Trump retrospective job approval\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nPoll dates Job approval Total approve Total disapprove Strongly approve Somewhat approve Somewhat disapprove Strongly disapprove 10/1-10/24 50 50 27 23 12 37 7/24-8/1/24 48 52 29 19 10 42 5/6-15/24 46 54 26 20 13 41 3/18-28/24 47 53 25 22 12 40 Marquette Law School Poll, national surveys, latest: Oct. 1-10, 2024 Question: Overall, do you approve or disapprove of the way Donald Trump handled his job when he was president?\n\nA final look at Biden vs Trump since 2023\n\nThe Marquette Law School Poll found a small but consistent Trump advantage over Biden among registered voters since May 2023, while Biden had a consistent edge from November 2021 through November 2022. The race was tied in January and March 2023. The full trend, including those saying they would vote for someone else or not vote, is shown in Table 24.\n\nTable 24: Presidential vote choice, Biden vs. Trump including someone else, Nov. 2021-July 2024\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nPoll dates Vote Joe Biden Donald Trump Someone else Wouldn't vote 7/24-8/1/24 43 47 11 0 5/6-15/24 40 44 14 2 3/18-28/24 42 44 13 2 2/5-15/24 42 45 9 4 11/2-7/23 40 42 15 2 9/18-25/23 39 44 12 4 7/7-12/23 37 38 19 5 5/8-18/23 34 41 19 7 3/13-22/23 38 38 20 4 1/9-20/23 40 40 17 3 11/15-22/22 44 34 19 4 9/7-14/22 42 36 19 3 3/14-24/22 43 38 16 4 1/10-21/22 45 33 18 4 11/1-10/21 43 35 18 4 Marquette Law School Poll, national surveys, latest: July 24-Aug. 1, 2024 Question: If the 2024 election for president were held today between former President Donald Trump, the Republican, and President Joe Biden, the Democrat, would you vote for Donald Trump or for Joe Biden? (Response options included someone else and wouldn't vote)\n\nAbout the Marquette Law School Poll\n\nThe survey was conducted Oct. 1-10, 2024, interviewing 886 registered voters nationwide, with a margin of error of +/-4.3 percentage points. For likely voters, the sample size is 699, with a margin of error of +/-4.7 percentage points.\n\nInterviews were conducted using the SSRS Opinion Panel, a national probability sample with interviews conducted online. Certain other data from this survey (focusing on those about public views of the Supreme Court) are held for release on Oct. 17. The detailed methodology statement, survey instrument, topline results, and crosstabs for this release are available on the Marquette Law School Poll website.",

        "text": "The Constitution and the federal election process\nOn Nov. 5, 2024, voters will head to the polls in person to select the next president and vice president of the United States, as well as members of the 119th Congress. How that process is conducted, and the Constitution\u2019s role in setting the guidelines for elections, has changed greatly over time.\n\nTo better understand how federal elections are conducted, here are some milestones and explanations of the process.\n\nWhat is the basic process for electing the President and Congress?\n\nIn 1788 and 1789, when elections were conducted to pick the first president, vice president, and Congress, the process was a work in progress. The drafters of the Constitution in 1787 had created a new institution, the Electoral College, to select the president and vice president, and these elections were the first time in which this new system was implemented.\n\nThe Electoral College, in Article 2, Section 1 of the Constitution, sets the number of presidential electors as equal to the number of members in a state\u2019s congressional delegation. The candidate receiving votes from a majority of electors from all states (and as of 1961, the District of Columbia) is elected president, and the runner-up becomes vice president. Under the original Constitution, electors cast votes for both president and vice president with no distinction, leading to a tie in the 1800 election between Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr. The 12th Amendment resolved this issue by changing the process to require distinct ballots for the president and vice president.\n\nToday, a presidential candidate needs at least 270 electoral votes to win an election. If there is no candidate with the minimum requirement to win, the House of Representatives convenes in January to pick the winner of the presidential race in a contingent election, and the Senate picks the vice president. This has happened three times in American history, and not since 1837.\n\nIn congressional elections, the Constitution provided for the direct election of House members \u201cby the People of the several States,\u201d but the election of members of the Senate by the state legislatures. In 1913, the 17th Amendment changed the process for the Senate to match the direct popular elections held for the House.\n\nWho set the rules for electing a president, vice president, and members of Congress?\n\nThe federal government and the states share responsibility for conducting general elections. Under the Constitution\u2019s Article I, Section 4, Clause 1 (the Elections Clause), state legislatures choose the times, places, and manner of holding elections for the House and the Senate, subject to Congress\u2019 authority to amend state regulations. The basic requirements for the presidential and vice-presidential elections are set by the Constitution\u2019s 12th Amendment, such as the rules of procedure for the Electoral College, and the contingent elections held in Congress if no candidate gets a majority in the general election.\n\nThe Constitution\u2019s Article II, Section 1, Clause 5 (the Qualifications Clause) requires the president to be a natural-born citizen, at least 35 years of age, and a resident of the United States for at least 14 years. Also, term limits under the 22nd Amendment bars candidates who have been elected twice as president or would serve more than 10 years by filling an unexpired term of another candidate. And if the Senate convicts a federal officer, including a president, at an impeachment trial, the Senate can also vote to bar the same person from holding public office.\n\nFor congressional elections, the Constitution\u2019s Article I, Section 2 sets the age requirement at 25 years for the House, with the candidate being a United States citizen for at least seven years, while Article 1, Section 3 sets the Senate candidate requirements at 30 years of age and nine years of citizenship. For any candidate, they must be a resident of that state at the time of their election.\n\nFor presidential and congressional candidates, the 14th Amendment\u2019s Insurrection Clause bars anyone from office who \u201cshall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.\u201d\n\nWho can vote in general elections?\n\nToday, most Americans citizens of legal age can register to vote in local, state, and general elections. Voter-age eligibility was set by the 26th Amendment in 1971, which requires voters to be 18 years of age on or before Election Day. States also have residency requirements for voting. People who are not citizens can\u2019t vote in elections. States also have different rules about when people convicted of a felony have their voting rights restored. But 13 states have the ability to permanently bar a convicted felon from voting under certain conditions.\n\nWhen are general elections held?\n\nThe official date of Election Day is set by law as \u201cthe Tuesday next after the 1st Monday in November, in every even numbered year.\u201d The last change in this date was in 1845. But the process of voting can start much earlier. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL), 47 states, the District of Columbia, and three territories offer some form of early voting by mail or in person. The NCSL says the average early voting start date is 27 days before Election Day. Minnesota, South Dakota, and Virginia started their early voting on Sept. 20, 2024. All votes must be cast before the polls close on Nov. 5, 2024, and ballots received by mail need to be postmarked by that date.\n\nWhat happens after Election Day?\n\nAfter Election Day, the states tabulate the results, including absentee and overseas ballots. States have different deadlines for certifying results for presidential and congressional elections. The results are usually certified by the end of November, but some states set Dec. 6 as their deadline.\n\nEach state has laws that allow a candidate, including a presidential or congressional candidate, to ask for an election recount. In some instances, a recount is automatically started based on the margin separating the top two candidates.\n\nFor presidential races, a federal law amended in 2022 (3 U.S. Code \u00a7 5) known as the \u201csafe harbor provision\u201d requires a state to settle these disputes and determine its electors six days before the Electoral College members meet in person. In 2024, that deadline is Dec. 11, since the college votes on Dec. 17, 2024.\n\nFederal law requires states to deliver certified Electoral College results to the vice president, serving as president of the Senate, and other parties by the fourth Wednesday in December; in the year 2024 that date falls on Dec. 25.\n\nThen, by federal statute 3 U.S.C. \u00a712, 13, the vice president or the Archivist of the United States asks a \u201csecretary of state or equivalent officer\u201d of that state to send the certified election results to Congress, using direct mail or a messenger.\n\nFor members elected to House and Senate, they are seated at the first meeting of the 119th Congress on Jan. 3, 2025. On rare occasions, Congress has assumed powers under Article I, Section 5 to refuse to seat a newly elected member. But a Supreme Court decision in 1969, Powell v. McCormick, greatly limited that practice.\n\nA joint session of Congress is required by the 12th Amendment to count the electoral votes and declare the winners of the presidential election. That joint session of Congress will be held on Jan. 6, 2025, at 1 p.m. If there are delays related to the count in Congress or a contingent election, those processes would need to be finished by noon on Jan. 20, 2025, for the next president and vice president to take their oaths of office. If that does not happen, the Speaker of the House would serve as president until Congress certifies a winner of the presidential election.\n\nScott Bomboy is the editor in chief of the National Constitution Center.",

        "text": "How is the world watching the 2024 US election?\nNo matter the outcome, the results of the 2024 United States presidential election are certain to have global impact. How are citizens and leaders in other parts of the world viewing this election? What\u2019s at stake for their countries and regions?\n\nThis was the focus of \u201cThe 2024 US Presidential Election: The World is Watching,\u201d a Starr Forum held earlier this month on the MIT campus.\n\nThe Starr Forum is a public event series hosted by MIT\u2019s Center for International Studies (CIS), and focused on leading issues of global interest. The event was moderated by Evan Lieberman, director of CIS and the Total Professor of Political Science and Contemporary Africa.\n\nExperts in African, Asian, European, and Latin American politics assembled to share ideas with one another and the audience.\n\nEach offered informed commentary on their respective regions, situating their observations within several contexts including the countries\u2019 style of government, residents\u2019 perceptions of American democratic norms, and America\u2019s stature in the eyes of those countries\u2019 populations.\n\nPerceptions of U.S. politics from across the globe\n\nKatrina Burgess, professor of political economy at Tufts University and the director of the Henry J. Leir Institute of Migration and Human Security, sought to distinguish the multiple political identities of members of the Latin American diaspora in America and their perceptions of America\u2019s relationship with their countries.\n\n\u201cAmerican democracy is no longer perceived as a standard bearer,\u201d Burgess said. \u201cWhile members of these communities see advantages in aligning themselves with one of the presidential candidates because of positions on economic relations, immigration, and border security, others have deeply-held views on fossil fuels and increased access to sustainable energy solutions.\u201d\n\nPrerna Singh, Brown University\u2019s Mahatma Gandhi Professor of Political Science and International Studies, spoke about India\u2019s status as the world\u2019s largest democracy and described a country moving away from democratic norms.\n\n\u201cIndian leaders don\u2019t confer with the press,\u201d she said. \u201cIndian leaders don\u2019t debate like Americans.\u201d\n\nThe ethnically and linguistically diverse India, Singh noted, has elected several women to its highest government posts, while the United States has yet to elect one. She described a brand of \u201cexclusionary nationalism\u201d that threatened to move India away from democracy and toward something like authoritarian rule.\n\nJohn Githongo, the Robert E. Wilhelm Fellow at CIS for 2024-25, shared his findings on African countries\u2019 views of the 2024 election.\n\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s soft power infrastructure in Africa is crumbling,\u201d said Githongo, a Kenyan native. \u201cChinese investment in Africa is up significantly and China is seen by many as an ideal political and economic partner.\u201d\n\nYouth-led protests in Kenya, Githongo noted, occurred in response to a failure of promised democratic reforms. He cautioned against a potential return to a pre-Cold War posture in Africa, noting that the Biden administration was the first in some time to attempt to reestablish economic and political ties with African countries.\n\nDaniel Ziblatt, the Eaton Professor of Government at Harvard University and the director of the Minda de Gunzburg Center for European Studies, described shifting political winds in Europe that appear similar to increased right-wing extremism and a brand of populist agitation being observed in America.\n\n\u201cWe see the rise of the radical, antidemocratic right in Europe and it looks like shifts we\u2019ve observed in the U.S.,\u201d he noted. \u201cTrump supporters in Germany, Poland, and Hungary are increasingly vocal.\u201d\n\nZiblatt acknowledged the divisions in the historical transatlantic relationship between Europe and America as symptoms of broader challenges. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, energy supply issues, and national security apparatuses dependent on American support may continue to cause political ripples, he added.\n\nDoes America still have global influence?\n\nFollowing each of their presentations, the guest speakers engaged in a conversation, taking questions from the audience. There was agreement among panelists that there\u2019s less investment globally in the outcome of the U.S. election than may have been observed in past elections.\n\nSingh noted that, from the perspective of the Indian media, India has bigger fish to fry.\n\nPanelists diverged, however, when asked about the rise of political polarization and its connection with behaviors observed in American circles.\n\n\u201cThis trend is global,\u201d Burgess asserted. \u201cThere\u2019s no causal relationship between American phenomena and other countries\u2019 perceptions.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re learning from each other,\u201d Ziblatt countered when asked about extremist elements in America and Europe. \u201cThere\u2019s power in saying outrageous things.\u201d\n\nGithongo asserted a kind of \u201ctrickle-down\u201d was at work in some African countries.\n\n\u201cCountries with right-leaning governments see those inclinations make their way to organizations like evangelical Christians,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir influence mirrors the rise of right-wing ideology in other African countries and in America.\u201d\n\nSingh likened the continued splintering of American audiences to India\u2019s caste system.\n\n\u201cI think where caste comes in is with the Indian diaspora,\u201d she said. \u201cIndian-American business and tech leaders tend to hail from high castes.\u201d These leaders, she said, have outsized influence in their American communities and in India.",

        "text": "Faculty panel weighs potential global effects of upcoming presidential election\nUNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. \u2014 Five professors in the Penn State School of International Affairs (SIA) discussed the upcoming U.S. presidential election from a global perspective at a panel event on Oct. 9. The professors examined the election through various lenses and topics, including international relations theory, global media, economics and foreign policy.\n\n\u201cI think we would all agree that what happens in the U.S. is consequential globally,\u201d said Mitchell Smith, director of SIA and professor of international affairs, who delivered opening remarks and served as moderator for the panel. \u201cThe crucial question is, where precisely are there consequences and how do we determine what they might be?\u201d\n\nThe panelists each ventured to answer that question within their field of expertise.\n\nAmbassador Dennis Jett, professor of international affairs and former two-time U.S. ambassador, utilized international relations theory to evaluate the foreign policy priorities of the Democratic and Republican parties. He characterized the differences between the two parties in terms of engagement versus isolationism; unilateralism versus multilateralism; and internationalism versus realism.\n\n\u201cIt all comes down, in the end, to which version of the world and America\u2019s role in it do you want to project and will result from the next election,\u201d Jett said. \u201cAnd that is the reason why there are a whole lot of people in the world wondering what the outcome is going to be, and which America it will be.\u201d",

        "text": "Guild News\nOctober 17, 2024\n\nIn preparation for the upcoming 2024 Presidential Election, DGA members were active participants in critical events broadcast only once every four years to inform the electorate. Below is the inside point of view from members working on the multiple-day Republican and Democratic Conventions and the Presidential Candidate Debate.\n\nThe Democratic National Convention\n\nDirector Glenn P. Weiss, a veteran of live events and variety shows who has helmed some of the biggest broadcasts including the Tonys, Oscars, Golden Globes, and Emmys, brought his expertise to the Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Chicago this past August.\n\nWith seven consecutive DNC conventions under his belt, Weiss oversaw the planning, design, staging, and execution of this year\u2019s event \u2014 made even more challenging by the late shift of candidates from Biden to Harris \u2014 as well as directing the official DNC feed.\n\nWeiss highlighted the unique challenges and triumphs of the 2024 convention, noting, \u201cOne of the biggest technical challenges was being able to create looks for a very \u2018screen-based\u2019 show and \u2018rehearse\u2019 everything from staging to roll call, to music acts to content displays while being in a room open to the press 24/7.\u201d\n\nWeiss also emphasized the crucial role of balancing speakers and audience reactions in live directing. \u201cThe balance of showing the speakers versus taking reaction shots is a very instinctual and important part of being a live Director,\u201d he explained, noting that their use of IMAG screens to display reaction shots in real-time \u201chelped create the energy in the room\u201d and advanced the story beyond mere event coverage.\n\nHe particularly praised the innovative approach to the \u201cRoll Call\u201d on night two of the convention, describing it as his proudest moment.\n\n\u201cWe decided to find a song for each state and have a DJ spin it while doing a complete screen takeover to match it, to make the Roll Call itself become an experience and performance.\u201d Weiss\u2019s creative direction, especially in moments like Lil Jon\u2019s surprise appearance for Georgia, contributed to what he called \u201csome of the biggest energy that I\u2019ve ever felt from a show in my entire career.\u201d\n\nAssociate Director Ken Diego, who also worked on the DNC\u2019s broadcast/streamcast teams in 2008, 2016, 2020 and the RNC\u2019s in 2012, agreed with Weiss\u2019s assessment regarding the \u201croll call\u201d sequence. \u201cGlenn called a highly energetic sequence that turned a what would have been a fairly static and dry procedural process into a party atmosphere. Associate Director Susan Kopensky, me and the rest of the DGA AD/SM team worked closely with Glenn to provide him with the ingredients he needed at his fingertips to keep the energy going throughout the nearly 80-minute long sequence. Catch it on YouTube if you\u2019ve missed it!\u201d\n\n\u201cAs the Associate Director on the event side, I can dig into the nuts and bolts of it all \u2014 coordinating with Producers, Stage Managers, the screens team, music department, which allows the Director to focus on the bigger picture and creative,\u201d added Associate Director Susan Kopensky, who has worked on the DNC since 2008. \u201cMy brain is very linear \u2014 so I like to look at the rundown in order and just talk and plan through it. It helps if I know each item in detail so I can communicate what\u2019s happening to everyone involved. Lots of information flows ahead of time but it really became about taking it day by day in the end.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Director\u2019s team is highly integrated in an event like this,\u201d said Stage Manager Gary Natoli, who was handling his first national convention. \u201cThe rehearsals are much more challenging on most live variety programs than the show. In this instance, with the convention, the rehearsals were easier than the show. Things are constantly changing in real time, much like a news event. The run-of-show would be changed on the fly, with items added and deleted as the evening progressed. Because of this, communication was paramount between Glenn Weiss, Susan Kopensky and Ken Diego, myself and my Stage Managing team. As many program elements were crafted and adjusted on the day, we would have to be flexible and ready to pivot at any moment.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe challenges of executing a five-plus-hour show every night for four consecutive nights was reduced because we had a shorthand from working together in the past,\u201d summed up Valdez Flagg, a Stage Manager with nearly 40 years experience on Guild productions. \u201cWe met at 6:30 each morning and discussed the event elements of the day and then each had our assignments. We rehearsed key speakers and performance elements during the morning and afternoon with Glenn Weiss, then set for the show.\u201d\n\nThe Republican National Convention\n\nDirector Ron de Moraes was tasked with heading up the coverage for the Republican National Convention (RNC). With over fifty years of experience as a multi-cam live and live-to-tape Director, de Moraes approached the 2024 event with a blend of seasoned expertise and innovative vision.\n\nDe Moraes drew on his experience as a private pilot to navigate inevitable hurdles. \u201cWhen something goes wrong \u2014 and it will \u2014 you aviate, navigate, and communicate,\u201d he explained. \u201cKeep the show on the air, use what\u2019s available to move forward, and allow the crew to work out solutions while you keep things running smoothly.\u201d\n\nHis approach was simple yet effective: \u201cI place myself virtually in the audience and ask, \u2018What do I want to see at this moment that will tell the story of what\u2019s happening and the reaction to it?\u2019\u201d This strategy allowed him to convey the atmosphere and energy of the convention to viewers at home, creating a dynamic visual narrative that captured the essence of the event.\n\nThe pool feed from the RNC was wrangled by a team headed by Director Sarah Carlson Brooke, who has helmed such notable events as Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 election night gathering in New York and President Obama\u2019s farewell speech in Chicago.\n\n\u201cAs Director of the network pool, you are responsible for making sure all the networks get their technical needs met, said Brooke. \u201cYou go into production with a distribution plan and a back-up to that plan because anything can happen in a live environment. We consider if a fiber line gets cut how will the networks still receive the feed? To maximize our coverage without spending too much we agree to share resources and need to ensure that if a shared camera goes down, we can still do a show. From the pool perspective this is a news event; what if there is a moment on stage that is news making and the show production doesn\u2019t want to cover it, do we have the resources to cover it? There are multiple back-ups to the plan.\n\n\u201cTechnology has given me the ability to be more flexible both in pre-production and for the broadcast. I can plan for events efficiently from a distance, doing walkthroughs remotely and although not always ideal I can cut a show without being on location if we home-run the cameras. With consumer cameras being of higher quality we can add coverage without too much cost. All in all, more seems possible with the advance of technology.\n\n\u201cThis year\u2019s RNC was a massive event to cover. Months in the making, we were on the ground weeks in advance to cover a four-night event. My proudest accomplishment was putting together a team that not only were the best at their crafts but enjoyed working together as team.\u201d\n\nAssociate Director Dawn DiCicco, who was working her first convention said of the event, \u201cIt\u2019s been on my bucket list to be a Network Pool AD for a Convention after I listened to Katlyn McBrearty from CBS do the RNC in 2020. She and Clara Yang were so organized, efficient, and communicative that after the 2020 RNC was over, I said to myself, \u2018If NBC ever draws the pool for Convention I want to do it!\u2019 The Conventions are such a fun and interesting pool event to work on because the Network is essentially covering the production of another team\u2019s show. For us, this meant having to coordinate every aspect of the broadcast with an outside team and finding ways to be flexible with changes we didn\u2019t know were coming or didn\u2019t have control of. It was a really challenging and rewarding experience to have your line cut be largely outside of your control, but it forced us to be extra nimble!\u201d\n\nThe Presidential Candidates Debate\n\n\n\nDemocratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris and the Republican nominee, former President Donald Trump, engaged in their debate on September 10. DGA Sixth Vice President Lily Olszewski, a Director at ABC News, directing Good Morning America as well as special event news coverage, was the hand at the helm guiding the worldwide audiences to ABC\u2019s coverage of the event.\n\n\u201cI have always wanted to direct a presidential debate,\u201d said Olszewski, who is currently in preproduction to direct ABC News\u2019 live election coverage on November 5. \u201cGetting to do this debate in particular, with seemingly so much at stake, made it all the more ful\ufb01lling. My parents, immigrants to the United States, would have been so proud.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe biggest technical challenge is to make sure we get things right. An event like a debate becomes part of historical record and gets a great deal of scrutiny. In terms of production and transmission, we need to make sure we have backups and backups to backups for every technical system. We even had to get special clearance from Secret Service to allow a truck to come into a secure perimeter to gas up the generator day of air.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe small size of the stage, the closeness of the moderators relative to the two candidates, the absence of an audience and the dark blue tones in the set design created a very intimate setting, nodding to the high stakes of this event. I relied heavily on small, robotic cameras, primarily because of the space constraints \u2014 we were shooting in the round, on a small stage, in a venue with a steep audience grade. We were able to mount cameras around the room and tightly group the cameras shooting the moderators and the candidates to give us the coverage we needed.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery Director is different and requires different things,\u2019 said Associate Director Liz Sobel, who was part of Olszewski\u2019s team. \u201cThis being Lily\u2019s first debate, I wanted to take away as much from her as I could so she could concentrate on her cameras, lighting and audio. We have worked together before, and we have a great relationship. She\u2019s so talented and great at communicating to the crew how best we can support her.\n\n\u201cThis was obviously a very high-profile event. There\u2019s a lot of tension, pressure, and nerves in the room. As the AD, I often try to lighten people up a bit before we go to air. Remind them how good they are, maybe crack a silly joke to make them laugh. All while, my nerves are kicking in and my heart starts racing, because my top priority is to get whatever production I\u2019m working on, on and off the air cleanly.\u201d\n\nStage Manager Anne Marie Kuehling, who also worked the RNC debate in December 2023 in addition to the September 10th Debate, recalled her role in making certain Olszewski had what she needed when she needed it.\n\n\u201cI feel it\u2019s important for the Stage Manager to anticipate potential issues, knowing the Director counts on that level of detail,\u201d said Kuehling. \u201cMy goal is to make her job go as smoothly as possible so she can do her best work. Until I get in the room I feel there\u2019s nothing to prepare. The venue and Director will dictate how things move. I also like to be familiar with names and titles of those I\u2019m dealing with, so I\u2019ll do my homework I was very aware of the heightened security of the Presidential Debate so I familiarized myself with the space and was sure to discuss my plans on dealing with the candidate, with her team and the Secret Service. Otherwise, it was like any other live event.\u201d\n\nPlease remember to vote on November 5, 2024.",

        "text": "US election 2024: Four takeaways from Harris's combative first Fox interview\nFour takeaways from Harris's combative first Fox interview\n\nEPA\n\nDemocratic US presidential nominee Kamala Harris has conducted a combative first interview with Fox News. She clashed repeatedly with her host on topics such as transgender prisoners, illegal immigration and President Joe Biden\u2019s mental fitness. Harris's foray on to a network that hosts some of her most vocal critics comes amid a flurry of media appearances with less than three weeks to go to polling day. Her rival Donald Trump, a frequent interviewee on Fox, appeared on the network on Wednesday himself - in a town hall-style event with an all-female audience.\n\nPolls suggest that, taken as a whole, women voters are sceptical of the former president, who took questions on familiar issues such as the economy and immigration but stumbled when asked about fertility treatment. During her own 25-minute sit-down, Harris and Fox host Bret Baier often interrupted each other, with Harris at one point saying: \u201cI\u2019m in the middle of responding to the point you\u2019re raising and I\u2019d like to finish.\u201d Here are four takeaways.\n\n1) Harris challenged to apologise\n\nThe vice-president's Fox interview began on the subject of immigration, with Baier playing her an emotional clip showing the mother of Jocelyn Nungaray, a 12-year-old girl killed by a migrant who had illegally crossed the border into the US and was released from detention. Asked whether she should apologise to the families of Americans who were killed by illegal migrants, Harris responded: \"I'm so sorry for her loss.\" \u201cThose are tragic cases,\u201d she added. \u201cThere\u2019s no question about that.\" Baier also asked about her 2019 stance that border crossings should be decriminalised. This is one of several issues where the vice-president has been accused of flip-flopping. Harris said: \u201cI do not believe in decriminalising border crossings and I have not done that as vice-president, and I would not do that as president.\u201d She went on to blame Trump for persuading Republicans in Congress to vote down a border deal earlier this year, saying: \"He preferred to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem.\"\n\n2) Questions on gender surgery for prisoners\n\nHarris was asked about taxpayer-funded gender reassignment surgery for prisoners, a policy she has in the past said she supports. Asked if she would as president advocate for taxpayer dollars to be used to that end, she responded: \"I will follow the law.\" When pressed for more details, she said such surgeries had been available to prisoners while Trump was in office. However, no transgender surgeries took place in the federal prison system while Trump was president. The Federal Bureau of Prisons told BBC Verify that two federal inmates have had gender reassignment operations - the first in 2022 and the second in 2023. When Harris was running as a Democratic candidate for president in 2019, she checked a box in a questionnaire from a civil rights group saying that as president, she would use her authority to ensure that transgender-identifying detainees in prison and immigration facilities would have access to \"treatment associated with gender transition, including all necessary surgical care\". The Harris campaign has said this \u201cis not what she is proposing or running on\u201d in the 2024 election.\n\n3) Vice-president tries to distance herself from Biden\n\nFox played a clip from an interview Harris gave last week saying that there's \"not a thing\" she would change about the actions of the current Biden-Harris administration, in which she serves as vice-president. She went further than she has gone before in trying to place some distance between herself and her boss. \"Let me be very clear, my presidency will not be a continuation of Joe Biden's presidency,\" she said on Wednesday, without elaborating. Baier pressed Harris on her belief that American voters do not want to \"go back\" to Trump, and whether people that continue to support the former president are \"stupid\" or \"misinformed\". \"I would never say that about the American people,\" Harris responded. Baier also pressed her on why one of her campaign promises is to \u201cturn the page\u201d when she has been vice-president for more than three years. Harris turned to criticising Trump.\n\n4) Harris sidesteps question on Biden mental state\n\nHarris deflected questions from Baier concerning Biden's mental state. Asked when she first noticed that Biden's mental faculties \"appeared diminished\", Harris said: \"Joe Biden, I have watched in from the Oval Office to the Situation Room, and he has the judgment... and experience to do exactly what he has done in making very important decisions on behalf of the American people.\" When pressed further on the issue, Harris responded: \"Joe Biden is not on the ballot, and Donald Trump is.\"",

        "text": "Can Jewish voters decide the election?\nIn the run-up to the presidential election, Brandeis Stories asked university faculty to provide expert analysis and insight into some of the issues raised during this campaign season.\n\nAlthough the majority of American Jews live in states that are thought to be uncontested (California, Florida, New Jersey, and New York), Jews represent 2% or more of the voting age population in two states that are among the most hotly contested: Pennsylvania and Arizona.\n\nYet, if we set aside the toxic and stereotypical element, is there any truth to the idea that Jewish voters could determine the outcome of the 2024 presidential election? Given the margins in the two previous elections, it is certainly possible. Jewish voters tend to vote in large numbers (perhaps 80% or more of Jewish adults) and, while Jews represent only 2.4% of the overall U.S. population, in several of the 2024 battleground states their numbers are large enough to swing the election.\n\nDonald Trump has said that Jews will be to blame if he loses the election and that, unless he is elected, Israel will be annihilated. Whatever one\u2019s political commitments, these comments should be understood as evocative of long-standing antisemitic views of Jewish control and Jewish self-interest.\n\nPennsylvania\u2019s Jewish population includes 300,000 adults, nearly 3% of the state\u2019s eligible voters. In 2016, Trump won Pennsylvania by a margin of less than .7%, while in 2020, Biden took the state by a margin of 1.2%. As of 2020, more than two thirds of the state\u2019s Jewish adults identified or leaned Democratic. If 80% of Pennsylvania\u2019s Jewish voters participate in the 2024 election, a shift of even 5% in either turnout or voting patterns could have a major impact on the results.\n\nArizona has a smaller Jewish population than Pennsylvania, approximately 125,000 adults, slightly more than 2% of the state\u2019s eligible voters. In 2016, Trump received 90,000 more votes than Hillary Clinton (+3.5%), while in 2020, Biden won Arizona with a margin of just over 10,000 votes (+.3%). As of the 2020 election, the majority of Arizona\u2019s Jewish voters identified or leaned Democratic. Again, as in Pennsylvania, even a small shift in who votes, or in voting patterns, could shift the results in that state.\n\nWho are Jewish voters?\n\nIf Jewish voters do have the potential to swing the election, how are they likely to vote? Although Jewish voters are not monolithic in their views on social issues or regarding the candidates they support, three times as many view themselves as liberal rather than conservative. The liberal political orientation of much of the U.S. Jewish population is a consistent finding of local Jewish community studies conducted by the Cohen Center for Modern Jewish Studies and the data syntheses done by our Steinhardt Social Research Institute.\n\nJewish liberalism is also confirmed by the Pew Research Center in national studies of U.S. Jewry. A Pew study conducted just prior to the 2020 election found that more than 70% of the Jewish population identified as Democrats or were independents who leaned Democratic. The consistency of these findings should not be surprising given Jews\u2019 high propensity for having college and postgraduate degrees, which are strongly associated with liberalism and identification with the Democratic party (Pew).\n\nDespite their general tendency to identify as liberal, American Jews are nevertheless diverse. Some have consistently liberal (or conservative) policy views. Others, like Americans in general, have a complex mix of liberal and conservative views on different political topics. In general, more religious Jews are more likely to be conservative and the least religiously engaged more likely to be liberal; even within these Jewish religious subgroups, there is considerable diversity.\n\nOne question that has been raised is whether Israel will be a central issue, perhaps pulling liberal and moderate Jewish voters away from their support of Kamala Harris. There is not a lot of data, but a set of recent studies conducted in battleground states by a pollster affiliated with the Jewish Democratic Council of America suggests that Harris has strong support and that Trump has not made inroads (71% v. 26% in a two-way vote). The issues that most concern Jewish voters are the issues of concern for all voters: the future of democracy, abortion, and the economy.\n\nHow might Jews influence the 2024 election?\n\nGiven the winner-take-all design of our electoral college system, just a small number of voters in particular states can shape the national outcome. This potential is clearly evident in Pennsylvania and Arizona, but the opportunity exists in nearly a half-dozen additional states, and perhaps others which were not considered in contention until recently. Of the larger battleground states that have been predicted to be decided by small margins, Michigan, Georgia, and North Carolina (with a total of 47 electoral votes), have significant Jewish populations, large enough to swing the election.\n\nThere is no doubt that in the contested presidential election of 2024, the Jewish vote matters. If the past is prologue to the future, they are likely to support Kamala Harris. Trump\u2019s efforts to paint himself as the savior of Israel do not appear to be making a difference. But prediction is difficult and the extent to which the voices of Jewish voters shape the outcome is a function of how close the race is in a small number of battleground states.",

        "text": "Ahead of US Election, TikTok and Facebook fail to block disinformation\nSocial media has become the public sphere through which voters gather information, discuss politics and follow election campaigns. It is also the primary means for political campaigns to access new audiences and \u2018get out the vote\u2019. Disinformation spreading through social media platforms has been a serious issue in previous US elections, and the same is true for this year. As one of the most influential nations in the world, as well as one of the greatest emitters of greenhouse gas, the outcome of the US election will have a major impact in the global fight against climate breakdown.\n\nYouTube and Facebook are by far the most popular social media platforms among US adults \u2013 with 83% and 68% of adults reporting use of them, respectively. TikTok\u2019s user base is smaller (only 33% of US adults), but it is the key platform through which to mobilise the youth vote. Both the Harris and Trump campaigns have invested in ads on online platforms.\n\nWith election day in the US just three weeks away, all three platforms must ensure their political ad policy enforcement is watertight.\n\nHow did we test if we could get election disinformation onto social media platforms?\n\nIn advance of the hotly contested presidential election between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, we tested if three of the most popular social media platforms in the US \u2013 Google\u2019s YouTube, Meta\u2019s Facebook, and TikTok \u2013 were able to detect disinformation in ads.\n\nThe ad content we tested contained:\n\nOutright false election information (for example, that you can vote online);\n\nInformation designed to suppress people from voting (for example, that you must pass an English language test in order to vote);\n\nContent that threatens electoral workers and processes (for example, calling for a repeat of the 6 January 2021 attack on the Capitol);\n\nContent questioning the eligibility of a candidate to stand for election; and\n\nIncitement to violence against a candidate.\n\nWe translated these ads into \u2018algospeak\u2019, using numbers and symbols as stand-ins for letters. We did this to test the effectiveness of the platforms\u2019 moderation systems because \u2018algospeak\u2019 has become increasingly common across the Internet as people seek to bypass content moderation filters. We didn\u2019t declare that the ads were political or complete any identity verification processes. All the ads we submitted violate Meta, TikTok and Google\u2019s policies.\n\nAfter the platforms had informed us whether the ads had been accepted, we deleted them, so they weren't published.",

        "text": "Just So You Know: Foreign Threat Actors Likely to Use a Variety of Tactics to Develop and Spread Disinformation During 2024 U.S. General Election Cycle\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency ( CISA ) are issuing this announcement to raise awareness of the efforts posed by foreign threat actors to spread disinformation in the lead up to, and likely in the days following, the 2024 U.S. general election. Foreign threat actors are knowingly disseminating false claims and narratives that seek to undermine the American people's confidence in the security and legitimacy of the election process\n\nThe FBI and CISA have no information suggesting malicious cyber activity against U.S. election infrastructure has compromised the integrity of voter registration information, prevented an eligible voter from casting a ballot, impacted the integrity of any ballots cast, or disrupted the ability to count votes or transmit unofficial election results in a timely manner. However, foreign adversaries may use false or misleading narratives that indicate otherwise to further their objectives of undermining American public confidence in democratic processes and institutions.\n\nWhile foreign malign influence operations and disinformation targeting American elections are not new, the proliferation of generative artificial intelligence ( AI )-enabled tools is exacerbating pre-existing tactics. Generative AI-enabled tools have lowered the barrier for foreign malicious actors to conduct more sophisticated influence campaigns. We are seeing foreign actors use these tools to develop and distribute more compelling synthetic media messaging campaigns and inauthentic news articles, as well as synthetic pictures and deepfakes (video and audio) at greater speed and scale across numerous US- and foreign-based platforms. These efforts to develop content are designed to undermine voter confidence and to entice unwitting consumers of the information to discuss, share, and amplify the spread of false or misleading narratives.\n\nForeign threat actors use a variety of methods, often in tandem, to knowingly spread and amplify false or misleading claims about voting processes and results, including false claims that the processes or results have been compromised by malicious cyber activity to cast doubt on the legitimacy or outcome of the vote. These actors use commercial firms, paid influence, witting and unwitting Americans, publicly available and dark web media channels, online journals, messaging applications, spoofed websites, emails, text messages, and fake online personas on U.S. and foreign platforms to spread and amplify these false claims.\n\nIn previous public service announcements, the FBI and CISA raised awareness about tactics that could be used in foreign malign influence operations to undermine public confidence in elections. Those announcements highlighted foreign threat actors' use of publicly available voter registration information as \"evidence\" to falsely claim that a cyber operation compromised voting systems or altered election results. Similarly, foreign threat actors may falsely claim that ransomware or distributed denial of service incidents impacting election offices could impact the security or accuracy of vote casting or counting processes.\n\nRussian Influence Efforts As part of efforts to combat foreign actors who are seeking to interfere in and influence U.S. elections, the Department of Justice ( DOJ ), in collaboration with federal partners, has taken a series of actions to degrade Russian threat actors' capabilities to conduct these malign influence campaigns. In July 2024, the DOJ, in coordination with U.S. and international partners, exposed a covert Russian government-operated, AI-enhanced social media bot farm using specialized software to create fictitious social media personas at scale. In September 2024, the DOJ took steps to disrupt Russian government-directed foreign malign influence campaigns by seizing more than 32 internet domains controlled by Russian government malign influence actors. The DOJ also indicted employees of a Russian state-controlled media outlet who covertly funded and directed a U.S.-based company that deployed nearly $10 million to disseminate pro-Russian narratives to a U.S. audience. Over the course of these actions, the DOJ seized website domains that Russian malign influence actors created and deliberately designed to look like legitimate mainstream news websites (see below for examples). Many of the seized domains employed \"cybersquatting,\" \u2014 a method of registering a domain intended to mimic another person's or company\u2019s domain. The images below are screen captures of articles produced by these Russian government actors. These examples include websites such as \"washingtonpost.pm\", and \"fox-news.in,\" which are not the real websites of the Washington Post and Fox News Russian government or proxy-created fake media websites falsely presenting as prominent U.S. news outlets with propaganda messaging and articles to further the threat actors\u2019 intended messaging and goals. Russian malign influence actors also created fake social media profiles posing as U.S. citizens to direct users to these fake news websites and purchased social media advertisements to drive traffic to the specific fake articles on the fake news site. The Appendix at the end of this document provides a compilation of websites that the FBI, Department of State, or Department of Treasury have previously publicly attributed to Russian malign influence actors, as well as websites and social media accounts that the Intelligence Community has attributed to Russian malign influence actors.\n\nIranian Influence Efforts In addition to Russia, Iran is also undertaking influence operations as it has in past election cycles, including through its cyber apparatus, targeting current and former U.S. government officials, members of the media, nongovernmental organizations, and individuals associated with U.S. political campaigns. Iran is probably using generative AI and inauthentic personas to hide its hand and attempt to sow discord during the 2024 U.S. election cycle. On September 27, 2024, the DOJ charged three Iranian nationals identified as employees of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps ( IRGC ), for a wide-ranging hacking conspiracy targeting current and former U.S. officials. The three IRGC employees are alleged to have conspired to hack into accounts of current and former U.S. officials, members of the media, nongovernmental organizations, and individuals associated with U.S. political campaigns. That indictment further alleged that in June 2024, the IRGC conspirators engaged in a \"hack-and-leak\" operation, in which they sought to weaponize campaign material stolen from a U.S. Presidential campaign. Additionally, the FBI, U.S. Cyber Command, the Department of Treasury, and the United Kingdom's National Cyber Security Centre have previously disseminated a Joint Cybersecurity Advisory that includes a list of malicious domains used by cyber actors working on behalf of the IRGC, which is linked below. We have also seen Iranian actors use similar tactics as Russian malign influence actors where they create inauthentic news sites posing as a legitimate media organization (see example below). Iranian government or proxy-created website presenting as a fake local news organization, which uses propaganda messaging and articles to further Iran's intended messaging and goals.\n\nRecommendations We urge the American public to critically evaluate the sources of the information they consume and to seek out reliable and verified information from trusted sources, such as state and local election officials. Specifically, we recommend the American public take the following precautions: Educate yourself and others on the tactics of foreign malign influence operations, including the use of generative AI and deep-fakes, and their goal to undermine American public confidence in U.S. democratic institutions and processes. Greater public awareness may help limit the spread of foreign malign influence campaigns.\n\nSeek out information from trusted, official sources, such as state and local election officials, and verify reported claims through trusted, official sources before sharing such information.\n\nTo better understand what you are viewing, know the media and social media company policies and citation rules to denote or disclose content created or doctored with generative AI tools. When viewing content, consider who produced it and look for labels that may identify the content as AI-generated.\n\nConsider reporting information concerning suspicious or criminal activity, to include the distribution of knowingly false information regarding the time, place, or manner of elections designed to deprive individuals of their right to vote, to their local FBI field office.\n\nRole of the FBI and CISA in Elections The FBI and CISA coordinate closely with federal,state, and local election partners and provide services and information to safeguard U.S. voting processes and maintain the resilience of U.S. elections. The FBI, alongside DOJ prosecutors, is responsible for investigating and prosecuting election crimes, foreign malign influence operations, and malicious cyber activity targeting election infrastructure and other U.S. democratic institutions. The FBI does not investigate, collect, or maintain information on U.S. persons solely for the purpose of monitoring activities protected by the First Amendment. CISA, as the Sector Risk Management Agency for Election Infrastructure, is the federal government lead for working with critical infrastructure owners and operators, including the election infrastructure community, to ensure the security and resilience of election infrastructure from physical and cyber threats.\n\nAppendix A: Websites and Accounts Operated by Russian Malign Influence Actors The following websites the U.S. Government either attributes to or assesses are highly likely to be operated by Russian malign influence actors. Websites denoted with an asterisk have previously publicly attributed to Russian malign influence actors by the FBI, Department of State, or Department of Treasury.

        "text": "US presidential election 2024: What\u2019s at stake for the world?\nA Q&A with Professor Helmut K. Anheier and Research Associate Edward L. Knudsen\n\n\u201cOn November 5th, 2024, Americans will head to the polls in yet another pivotal election, one that promises to have razor-thin margins,\u201d write Hertie School Senior Professor of Sociology Helmut K. Anheier and Research Associate Edward L. Knudsen in their latest Berggruen Governance Index.\n\nTheir index aims to give broader context to the story of democracy\u2019s future worldwide, taking a comprehensive look at how well countries are governed beyond economic factors and going beyond standard media coverage that tends to present elections as sensationalised \u2018horse race\u2019 events.\n\nWe took this opportunity to ask the authors a couple of questions tied to the upcoming US presidential election and get their big picture analysis of its implications on the state of democracy worldwide.\n\nWhen Francis Fukuyama spoke at this year\u2019s Anniversary Forum here at the Hertie School, he warned that if Trump were to win the upcoming election, US democracy would really be in trouble. To what extent do you agree with this statement, and what exactly do you think is at stake for the US and indeed the world?\n\nWe agree that Fukuyama accurately identifies the risk of a second Trump presidency, but would caution against viewing this as the only threat to US democracy. In our report, we observe that many cases of democratic backsliding have occurred at the state level \u2013 with declines taking place during the Obama administration when Republican-led state legislatures changed voting laws, redrew electoral districts, etc.\n\nThis suggests that even a Harris presidency may not be able to reverse these declines, and that the dangers to US democracy will go far beyond any single election. That being said, we do identify several Republican proposals that are likely to cause severe damage to democratic accountability that have no parallel in the Harris platform.\n\nIn a 2022 article in the New York Times, you remarked that US democracy had been in decline since Trump\u2019s election, and especially after the events at Capitol Hill on 6 January 2021. To what degree did that downward trend continue through Biden\u2019s presidency?\n\nUS democratic accountability did see a slight uptick after Biden took office. What was notable during the Biden administration were efforts to boost US state capacity, such as infrastructure investments and improvements to the tax collection system in the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nHowever, this did not even come close to reversing the previous losses, and the effects of these measures may not show up in the data for several years and could mostly be undone under a second Trump presidency. This suggests that Presidents are most successful in altering governance trends when they can enact lasting reforms and build a new consensus, rather than more fleeting policy changes.\n\nIn observing these elections, how have unfolding events chimed with or perhaps gone against expectations you might have from your research for the Berggruen Index?\n\nPolitical norms are both vital to a well-functioning democracy and very difficult to capture quantitatively. Although we can pick up a weakening of both state capacity and democratic accountability in the Berggruen Governance Index metrics, the rapid erosion of norms in the US over the last decade means that the actual damage to American democracy may be far greater than what we have captured up to now.\n\nFor this reason, we are working on building a governance indicator for each of the 50 US states, with the hopes that we can measure developments at both the federal and the state level.\n\nClick on the link to read the full report discussing developments in US governance since 2000.",

        "text": "Americans say the economy is a top election issue. Here's how economists are grading it.\nWith less than three weeks until the U.S. presidential election, millions of Americans say the economy is a top issue as they decide how to cast their vote \u2014 an understandable focus after the rollercoaster of the past four years, which included everything from a bear market to the hottest inflation since the 1980s.\n\nBut with the chaos of the pandemic behind us and inflation edging close to its pre-2020 levels, the U.S. economy is ripe for a fresh assessment of its strengths and weaknesses, along with whether the Biden administration's economic policies have paid off.\n\nBy many measures, the U.S. economy has regained its footing, emerging from the health crisis with the type of growth that it experienced prior to 2020. Gross domestic product is growing solidly, while unemployment and the labor market have also rebalanced, remaining close to their pre-pandemic levels. Critically, inflation has dropped to a three-year low and is approaching the Federal Reserve's annual target of 2%.\n\nTo the surprise of many forecasters, that rebound occurred even as the Fed boosted interest rates to a 23-year high in an effort to cool inflation. Historically, such rate hikes have often led to recessions. But so far, the U.S. has avoided a downturn, and instead appears heading for a \"soft landing,\" or when the economy continues to grow and the job market remains strong despite the headwinds of higher rates.\n\n\"In the 35 years I've been an economist, I've rarely seen an economy performing as well as it is,\" Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics who has previously advised presidential candidates from both parties, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"I'd give it an A+.\"\n\nLike Zandi, many other experts are giving the economy strong marks. The U.S. economy is \"hot, hot, hot,\" noted Yardeni Research in an October 17 report. The job market is \"resilient\" and \"there is no quit in the U.S. consumer,\" analysts at Oxford Economics told investors this week.\n\nYet many Americans might scoff at such bullish assessments: 6 in 10 now describe the U.S. economy as either \"fairly bad\" or \"very bad,\" according to CBS News polling.\n\nThat's not lost on Zandi and other economists. \"The difference between the happy talk of economists and what people say has never been this wide,\" he noted.\n\nWhy Americans give the economy poor marks\n\nOnly 1 in 10 Americans rate the economy as \"very good,\" according to CB News poll of registered voters taken between October 8-11. Meanwhile, about 52% of Americans say they and their family are worse off today than they were four years ago, Gallup found in a new poll.\n\n\"Despite recent economic data suggesting the labor market, consumer spending and the overall economy are proving to be very resilient and strong, consumers' sentiment about economic conditions and future prospects remain downbeat,\" Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide, told CBS MoneyWatch.\n\nThe discordant economic views among experts and typical Americans reflects several factors. First, and perhaps most pressing in the short-term, prices around the U.S. remain elevated even as the searing inflation that followed the pandemic descends to normal levels.\n\nSecond, economists tasked with the complexity of deciphering a $29 trillion economy naturally rely on broad metrics such as GDP, the Consumer Price Index and the nation's unemployment rate.\n\nYet such data, even when bolstered with consumer confidence surveys and other public sentiment measures, don't capture the far more nuanced financial realities facing households. For many Americans, their perceptions are shaped less by fluctuations in growth rates or monthly job gains than by the more palpable daily struggle to pay for food, rent and health care.\n\nThird, mounting inequality in wealth and income has made successive generations of Americans more vulnerable to economic crises at the same time that traditional financial milestones, such as owning a home, become harder to achieve.\n\nFinally, polling suggests that political polarization is significantly coloring people's views of the economy. In such an environment, a sharp disconnect between what the economy looks like on paper and how people actually experience it is not only unsurprising, but perhaps inevitable.\n\nAn educational and party divide\n\nIndeed, there are maor partisan and educational divides in how people assess the economy, CBS News polling shows. For one, Republicans are much more likely to give the economy poor marks than Democrats, a reflection of partisan views about the direction of the nation.\n\n\"If you are Republican, it doesn't matter what you say \u2014 they don't think the economy is good,\" Zandi noted.\n\nAlmost 9 in 10 conservatives describe the economy as bad, compared with 3 in 10 people who lean liberal, CBS News polling found. If former president Donald Trump wins in November, Zandi predicts that sentiment about the economy will shift, with liberal-leaning voters suddenly souring on the economy and conservatives becoming more upbeat.\n\nBut there's another divide that points to the longer-term inequality issues in the U.S.: a gap between people with and without college degrees. Americans without a bachelor's degree are much more negative about the economy than those with a college education \u2014 a disparity that may point to decades of lagging wage growth for workers with only high school degrees.\n\nFor instance, 47% of White voters with a college degree describe the economy as good, compared with 29% of those without a diploma, an 18 percentage-point gap, CBS News polling found earlier this month.\n\nAmericans with college degrees have seen their income and wealth surge during the past several decades, leaving non-college educated workers behind. The disparities are particularly acute for young men without a bachelor's degree, with Pew finding that this group earned median incomes of $45,000 in 2023 \u2014 22% less than the same group in 1973.\n\nThose workers are feeling the sting of inflation the most acutely, Zandi said. \"Grocery, rents, gasoline took off largely because of the pandemic and the Russian war, and those are things that you need and are a good part of the budget of lower-income households, who are lesser educated.\"\n\nThe \"misery\" index\n\nAnother way to measure the economic realities of Americans is the so-called misery index, which represents the sum of the unemployment and inflation rates. The idea is that higher unemployment and inflation will lead to more unhappiness, while lower rates will reduce suffering.\n\nThe misery index, an informal measure followed by economists, stood at 6.5% in September, below its average since 1947 of 9.1%, Ed Yardeni of Yardeni Research noted in a recent report.\n\n\"Should consumers be happier?\" Yardeni asked.\n\nMaybe, but Yardeni pointed out that Americans are responding to more than the inflation rate and the health of the job market. Americans also face many other financial pressures, ranging from high borrowing costs due to the Federal Reserve's interest-rate hikes to a widespread feeling of \"precarity,\" especially among younger voters who are struggling to buy their first home or pay college loans \u2014 issues that aren't tracked by the misery index.\n\nOlder Americans, meanwhile, have greatly prospered from higher home values and a stock market that continues to hit new highs, but half of them are also financially supporting their adult children, Yardeni noted.\n\n\"On average, parents providing financial support give $1,384 to their children monthly,\" he said. \"That's more than twice what the average working parent in the study contributed to his/her own retirement savings monthly.\"\n\nLower inflation, higher prices\n\nInflation, meanwhile, has dipped to a three-year low, hitting 2.4% in September, the most recent Consumer Price Index shows. That's not far from the Fed's goal of driving it down to 2% on an annual basis, opening the door to the central bank's September rate cut, its first since the start of the pandemic.\n\nBut despite the Fed's jumbo 0.5 percentage point cut last month, borrowing remains expensive, including for mortgages, which has priced many homebuyers out of the market.\n\n\"The reasons for the sour outlook are rooted in the prior surge in inflation that has greatly lifted the level of prices for goods and services, including for homes and rents, and the still-high interest rate burdens facing particularly lower- and middle-income households,\" Bostjancic said.\n\nFor instance, groceries still cost 26% more than in January 2020 just prior to the pandemic, a painful hit to the wallet whenever consumers stock up on food.\n\n\"Almost everyone has a food item they purchase on a regular basis they use as a litmus test for everything they view about economy, and they are paying more than they did four years ago,\" Zandi said. \"A pound of sugar, ramen noodles \u2014 even though the price of those things haven't risen much over the last year, they are 20-25% higher than they were four years ago.\"\n\nPrices \"aren't going back to what they were,\" he added. \"That's what people feel.\"\n\nEmployment and wages\n\nThe U.S. unemployment rate remains near a 50-year low, although it has inched up slightly in recent months, which is one reason the Fed opted to cut rates last month.\n\nHiring is slowing but remains relatively strong, with employers adding 254,000 jobs in September, blowing away economists' forecasts. The U.S. is creating about 150,000 to 175,000 new jobs per month on average, Zandi said, which he described as \"extraordinary.\"\n\n\"When you look at forecasts before the pandemic of job growth, it would be 75,000, not 150,000,\" he noted.\n\nMeanwhile, workers' wages have edged ahead of inflation since May 2023, giving employees some relief. But it might not be enough to offset the pain of high prices.\n\n\"Even though income levels for households have also increased, many times catching up to the rise in inflation, consumers still reel at the sticker shock of higher prices,\" Bostjancic said.\n\nStock market at record highs\n\nWhile the stock market doesn't reflect the economy, rising asset prices have helped lift the financial fortunes of millions of Americans. This year, the S&P 500 has repeatedly hit record highs, providing gains to the 401(k) plans and investment accounts of workers and retirees alike.\n\nBut only 6 in 10 Americans own stocks, according to Gallup, and more than half of workers lack access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan.\n\nThose Americans \"aren't benefiting from record stock prices,\" Zandi said.\n\nMany are unaware that the stock market has reached record heights, with only 4 in 10 Americans telling CBS News that equity prices are higher than at the start of the year. About 3 in 10 say it's lower or the same, while another third say they're unsure.\n\n\"I have this metaphor in my mind that the economy is like an elephant, and depending on what you part you touch you can get a different sense\" of what it is, Zandi said.",

        "text": "Election 2024: Is the United States Ready to Confront the Axis of Autocracies?\nThe news that Chinese firms are helping Russia to produce long-range drones to use against Ukraine and that North Korea is sending thousands of troops to fight in Ukraine highlights one of the most disturbing trends in global politics\u2014growing cooperation among China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea. Neither Kamala Harris nor Donald Trump has said much on the campaign trail about this emerging axis of autocracies. But whoever wins next month will need to devise a strategy to respond to it.\n\nThe war in Ukraine might look like the reason for the formation of this axis, which has been called the axis of upheaval, the axis of anger, the axis of disorder, and the quartet of chaos, among other names. But increasing economic, diplomatic, technological, and especially intelligence and military cooperation among the four countries predates Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin\u2019s decision in February 2022 to strike a strategic partnership with \u201cno limits.\u201d Russia began selling arms to China well before invading Ukraine, Russia and Iran have collaborated for more than a decade to keep Bashar al-Assad in power in Syria, and China and Russia have worked for years to help keep North Korea afloat.\n\nThat said, cooperation between axis members has intensified since the war in Ukraine began. Iran has sold Russia thousands of drones, while North Korea provided Russia with millions of artillery shells even before contributing troops. China says it is not supporting Russia\u2019s war effort. However, Chinese firms supply Russia with dual-use technologies that are used to build weapons, and Chinas now absorbs nearly half of Russian energy exports. China and Russia have increased their joint military exercises, which included flying bombers in international airspace in Alaska\u2019s Air Defense Identification Zone this summer. Russia has in turn been providing highly sensitive military, space, and surveillance technology to China, Iran, and North Korea. This past June, Putin visited Pyongyang\u2014his first in twenty-four years\u2014and signed a comprehensive strategic partnership treaty with Kim Jong-un.\n\nThe Water's Edge James M.

Most of the interactions among the four countries are bilateral rather than trilateral or quadrilateral. China\u2019s refusal to overtly aid Russia in its war against Ukraine shows that their partnership does have discernible limits, at least for now.\n\nHow much cooperation among axis members might deepen\u2014and whether it will expand to include other countries\u2014can be debated. The group brings to mind the adage that politics makes for strange bedfellows. China is a Marxist-Leninist state. Russia is personalist dictatorship defending Orthodox Christianity. Iran is a militant Shia theocracy. North Korea operates like a mafia state.\n\nSo this is not a group that shares a vision of the world it wants to create. What it agrees on is the world it wants to escape, namely, one in which U.S. power limits their freedom of action abroad and Western values threaten their control at home. All four countries are convinced that the United States, and the West more generally, are in terminal decline, while they believe their own growing power enables them to undermine U.S. global leadership. Their collective efforts are intended to hurry that outcome along.\n\nThe divergent interests among the members of the axis may ultimately prove its undoing. China and Russia vie for influence in Central Asia. Russia\u2019s growing closeness to North Korea troubles China. The Ukraine war jeopardizes Chinese goals in Europe. Iran\u2019s efforts to dominate its neighborhood complicates China\u2019s efforts to deepen ties to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. A falling out among axis members could be just around the corner.\n\nIt is a bad bet, though, to base U.S. policy on the hope that adversaries will stumble. Even if the axis doesn\u2019t grow into a true anti-Western bloc but remains, as Anne Applebaum puts it, about deals and not ideals, it poses a significant threat to U.S. interests. Collaboration among axis members makes it harder for the United States to achieve its foreign policy objectives\u2014as the war in Ukraine shows. The axis members can, and are, stoking crises in Gaza, Yemen, Africa, the Korean Peninsula, and elsewhere, all at a relatively low cost to themselves, that will strain, and perhaps even break, U.S. capabilities.\n\nThat\u2019s why the commander of the U.S. Army Pacific warned this week that the axis is a \u201cvery dangerous combination that we all should pay very, very close attention to.\u201d The challenge is devising an effective response that can be pursued at an acceptable cost. That is a task the next administration should not put off.\n\nCampaign Update\n\nIf early voting in Georgia is any indication, voter turnout in battleground states will be high this year. The Peachtree State recorded 328,000 votes on Tuesday, the first day of early voting. That set a record high for the first day of voting. The prior record was set in 2020 when 120,000 people cast votes. By Wednesday night, more than 620,000 Georgians had voted either early or by absentee ballot. As of this morning, the number was more than 900,000. To put things in perspective, roughly five million Georgians voted in 2020. If this week\u2019s trend continues, far fewer voters will be voting on Election Day itself than in past years. That will ease the burden on poll workers and perhaps diminish the chances for a chaotic ending to the balloting.\n\nSpeaking of Georgia, a state judge on Wednesday halted the implementation of the new rules that the Georgia State Election Board adopted last month, including one that requires county election workers to hand count the number of ballots cast in each precinct. The judge declared that \u201cthese rules are illegal, unconstitutional and void.\u201d The election board can appeal the ruling.\n\nGeorgia isn\u2019t the only state with election-related lawsuits. An Alabama judge ordered the state to stop purging inactive voters from its voter rolls. A Texas judge struck down parts of a 2021 state law that limits what can be done to assist people when voting. Election officials in a rural Virginia county are suing to require that the vote be counted by hand rather than by voting machines. Now is a great time to be an election lawyer.\n\nFlorida and North Carolina are both developing plans to relax voting rules in the wake of hurricanes Helene and Milton.\n\nWhat the Candidates Are Saying\n\nHarris the called the death of Yahya Sinwar, the mastermind behind the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel, an \"opportunity to finally end the war\" and a reason to begin planning the \"day after.\"\n\nIt\u2019s not clear, however, that Sinwar\u2019s death has made either Israel or Hamas more inclined to seek a ceasefire or brought the region closer to peace.\n\nHarris told Jewish voters on a call just before the start of Yom Kippur last Friday that \u201cIran must never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon\u201d and that \u201call options are on the table to make sure it never happens.\u201d\n\nTrump used an appearance at the Economic Club of Chicago to make his case that the United States needs a dose of tariff medicine to cure its economic woes. He told Bloomberg News Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait: \u201cTo me, the most beautiful word in the dictionary is tariff, and it\u2019s my favorite word.\u201d Trump disputed the views\u2014embraced by virtually all economists\u2014that tariffs will fuel inflation and lower economic growth, insisting that tariffs are \u201cgoing to have a massive effect, positive effect.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s comments make clear that his thinking about tariffs has evolved. During his presidency, he sought to use tariffs to gain leverage to negotiate trade deals that would help U.S. exporters and lower the trade deficit. He now describes tariffs as a way to force producers overseas to relocate to the United States. That would not be a quick process, however, as factories take time to build. The process would also cause considerable economic disruption as U.S. trading partners will retaliate against substantial new U.S. tariffs, leaving everyone worse off.\n\nTrump gave Ukraine additional reason this week to worry about the future of U.S. support should he return to the White House. The former president told a podcaster that Ukrainian President Zelensky \u201cshould never have let that war start. That war is a loser.\u201d That framing suggests that Trump believes that Ukraine should have handed over its eastern provinces in 2022 to appease Putin.\n\nTrump said at a Fox News town hall on Tuesday that he would invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 as the legal basis \u201cto target and dismantle every migrant criminal network operating on American soil.\" The law has been invoked just three times in U.S. history, and always in the context of a declared war. Legal experts differ on whether Trump can use the 226-year-old law, which allows the president to detain or deport the citizens of an enemy nation without a hearing, as he imagines. More broadly, Trump looks to be proposing to use the U.S. military on U.S. soil in ways that have few precedents in American history.\n\nWhat the Pundits Are Saying\n\nBob Woodward\u2019s newest book, War, which hit bookstore shelves on Tuesday, alleges that Trump had as many as seven phone calls with Putin since leaving the White House. Woodward\u2019s claim, which rests on a single source, has yet to be corroborated. What is undeniable, as the New York Times\u2019s Peter Baker reported, \u201cis that Mr. Trump has acted as something of a shadow president on international affairs\u201d since leaving the White House. \u201cForeign governments realized that Mr. Trump was still a force in American politics,\u201d according to Baker, \u201cand that they needed to take him into account in their dealings with the United States.\u201d The heads of government who have met with Trump include \u201cthe leaders of Ukraine, Israel, Poland, Hungary, Argentina, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.\u201d Trump was asked this week if he had spoken with Putin. His response: \u201cIf I did, it\u2019s a smart thing.\u201d\n\nAdam Posen, the president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, argued in Foreign Affairs that Trump\u2019s economic proposals threaten to derail the U.S. economy. In Posen\u2019s view, \u201calmost all of Trump\u2019s economic proposals would reduce supplies of labor, industrial inputs, consumer goods, and federal tax revenues. His strategy would impose uncertainty throughout the U.S. economy, as businesses and consumers would fear that prices could go up or that access to resources might be restricted at any time the government chooses. This is the exact opposite of the policies aimed at macroeconomic stability that have a proven track record worldwide of bringing sustained growth and low inflation.\u201d\n\nOliver Stuenkel warned in Foreign Policy that a second Trump presidency would likely push Latin America toward China. His argument is that \u201ca second Trump presidency would likely see the return of more explicit U.S. pressure on Latin American countries to pick sides in the brewing competition between the United States and China. That could create considerable friction in the region, just as it did during Trump\u2019s first term in office, when many countries warmed to China\u2019s embrace. The more aggressive Trump\u2019s approach to Latin America, the faster governments can be expected to balance Washington by fostering closer ties to Beijing.\u201d\n\nThe Cato Institute\u2019s Clark Packard and Scott Lincicome reviewed the various laws Congress has passed over the years delegating power to the president to set tariffs. Their conclusion: \u201cCongress has broadly delegated its constitutional tariff powers to the president, and there is a real risk that the legislative and judicial branches would be unwilling or unable to check a future president\u2019s abuse of US trade law as currently written.\u201d\n\nChristopher Chivvis and Stephen Wertheim wrote in Foreign Affairs that presidents don\u2019t always get their way with the foreign policy bureaucracy. \u201cThe bureaucracies that design and implement foreign policy, including the Defense Department, the State Department, and the intelligence agencies, have been essential to making the United States powerful and capable. But strong bureaucracies are also conditioned to preserve the existing way of doing things. Each agency naturally safeguards its mission and resources, and major change is always a threat to someone. As a result, bureaucratic resistance has frequently stymied change in Washington.\u201d\n\nHeather Hurlbut assessed what the election means U.S. trade policy. Her conclusion? \u201cThe two parties now start from a shared expectation of an international economic landscape shaped more by competition and industrial policy than by continued liberalization. However, the two presidential candidates\u2019 views of which trade tools to use, and whether to proceed with allies and partners or unilaterally, could not be more different.\u201d\n\nPolitico\u2019s Hailey Fuchs and Meridith McGraw explored the Trump campaign\u2019s refusal so far to participate in the transition process set up by the Presidential Transition Act. \u201cThe decision not to take federal assistance,\u201d they conclude, \u201callows them to raise unlimited funds without disclosing their donors, while avoiding oversight from federal bureaucrats, whom Trump and his advisers deeply distrust. But if Trump wins the election and continues to drag his feet on signing the agreement with the White House, it will limit the information he and his team can access to understand current federal operations and challenges.\u201d\n\nWhat the Polls Show\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll found broad support for Trump\u2019s proposal to raise U.S. tariffs. Overall, 56 percent of registered voters said they were more likely to support a candidate who backed a 10 percent tariff on all imports and a 60 percent tariff on imports from China. One-third of Democrats said they would be more likely to support a president who proposed tariffs. The Reuters/Ipsos poll, however, only asked about tariffs in the abstract. It did not ask respondents if they support increased tariffs given their likely costs. When Cato asked that question, support for tariffs fell substantially.\n\nThis is a reminder to be wary of polls about public support for specific policies. People often do not consider, or know, the consequences for any particular policy choice. Once they are reminded or told that policy changes can come with a price tag, their preferences can change dramatically.\n\nA Wall Street Journal poll of the seven battleground states found that voters have greater faith in Trump than Harris in handling the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine. Trump held a fifteen-percentage point lead in who can best handle the war in Gaza (48 percent to 33 percent), and an eleven-point lead in who can best handle the war in Ukraine (50 percent to 39 percent). The poll also found that the Middle East, Ukraine, and other foreign-policy issues fall way down the list of issues worrying voters.\n\nA Gallup Poll out today found that 52 percent of Americans say that they and their families are worse off today than they were four years ago. At first glance, that number is troubling news for the Harris campaign and good news for the Trump campaign. However, as is often the case with polling\u2014see above\u2014there may be less here than meets the eye. Gallup reports that the finding largely owes \u201cto Republicans\u2019 much greater likelihood to say this than opponents of the incumbent president\u2019s party had been in prior election years.\u201d\n\nThe Campaign Schedule\n\nElection Day is eighteen days away (November 5, 2024).\n\nElectors will meet in each state and the District of Columbia to cast their votes for president and vice president in sixty days (December 17, 2024).\n\nThe 119th U.S. Congress will be sworn into office in seventy-seven days (January 3, 2025).\n\nThe U.S. Congress will certify the results of the 2024 presidential election in eighty days (January 6, 2025).\n\nInauguration Day is ninety-four away (January 20, 2025).\n\nOscar Berry assisted in the preparation of this post.",

        "text": "5 Hot Health Care Topics in the Presidential Election\nEarly voting in the 2024 US presidential election is now under way in all 50 states. Although abortion has been a front burner issue in the race between Vice President Kamala Harris, a Democrat, and former President Donald Trump, a Republican, issues such as immigration and the economy have overshadowed other health care topics.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris | Image: White House photo\n\nFormer President Donald Trump | Image: White House photo\n\nBut this month, as seniors evaluate changes to Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage plans, some believe health care may rise on voters\u2019 radar before Election Day November 5, 2024.\n\nWhat would be Harris\u2019 health care priorities as president? Would Trump pick up where he left off? Both candidates\u2019 platforms and track records offer clues. Here are 5 hot topics in health care heading into Election Day:\n\nReproductive Health\n\nA recent KFF poll finds that for young women especially, the 2024 election is defined by the abortion issue\u2014specifically, Trump\u2019s 2016 vow to nominate Supreme Court justices who fulfilled his promise to overturn Roe v Wade. In June 2022, Trump\u2019s 3 appointees were part of the majority that supported the Dobbs decision, which turned regulation of abortion over to the states. Before President Joe Biden dropped his re-election bid, Harris had been the administration\u2019s messenger on restoring abortion rights. A former US senator from California who cast many tie-breaking votes as vice president, Harris has said that as president, she would advocate ending the Senate filibuster to restore Roe-era rights.\n\nA recent KFF poll shows that abortion is the most important issue for young women voting in the 2024 presidential election. | Image: Edmond Dantes for Pexels.\n\nDuring the single presidential debate, Trump claimed, erroneously, that legal scholars \u201call wanted this issue to be brought back to the states where the people could vote.\u201d According to the Guttmacher Institute, 13 states now have total bans while 4 states ban abortion at 6 weeks, before many women know they are pregnant. Trump has frequently made the false claim that Harris and other Democrats allow abortion up to and after birth.\n\nHowever, Trump said he won\u2019t sign a national abortion ban, and in the final days of the 2024 campaign, he has tacitly acknowledged that state-level bans have left health care providers confused, even where laws technically allow exceptions to save a mother\u2019s life. At a Fox town hall event airing October 16, 2024, he said some of the state laws are \u201ctoo tough,\u201d and \u201cthose are going to be redone because already there\u2019s a movement in those states.\u201d He has also offered inconsistent statements on banning medication abortion; however, Project 2025, a policy agenda developed by Trump administration alumni, calls for barring distribution of abortion pills by mail under the Comstock Act.\n\nHarris and Trump have also split on issues such as contraception, with the Biden-Harris administration supporting access; Harris\u2019 support for contraception access under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) dates to her time as California Attorney General. As president, Trump issued regulations that restricted funding for contraception; during the 2024 campaign, he first said he was open to state-level limits, but he later backed off the statement. The Trump administration also overturned longstanding rules under the Title X program that supported contraception access for those with low incomes; no funds could be used for contraception if the clinic also provided abortion access.\n\nFuture of the ACA\n\nFrom her time in the US Senate and during her first run for president in 2019, Harris has advocated for expanding the ACA. In the past, she supported progressive ideas such as Medicare for All, alongside private options. As president, she would likely hew more closely to the Biden-Harris record than her earlier positions.\n\nHer priorities include health care affordability, with one of the first big fights in the Congress coming early in 2025: Lawmakers must decide what to do about health care subsidies that were part of the American Rescue Plan of 2021 and were extended another 3 years under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).\n\nAs president, Trump failed to fully eliminate the ACA, but he did knock out pieces. Notably, he effectively killed the individual mandate; he also cut federal subsidies that caused rising premiums for marketplace plans while allowing \u201cskinny\u201d plans that did not cover all essential benefits required under the ACA. The problem with these plans, critics say, is that they don\u2019t reveal the hidden out-of-pocket costs that await consumers if they get sick. That\u2019s why there was pushback following the vice presidential debate when GOP nominee Sen JD Vance (R, Ohio) claimed that Trump had \u201csalvaged\u201d the ACA.\n\nTrump has long promised to offer an alternative to the ACA; during his own debate with Harris, he said he that he had a \u201cconcepts\u201d of a health plan. His 2020 budget proposal called for repealing both Medicaid expansion and ACA premium subsidies; instead, states would get block grants. However, these steps would be more challenging today than in 2017. Since Trump left office, 5 states have expanded Medicaid, bringing the total to 41.\n\nAmid the uncertainty over Trump\u2019s plans, 1500 physicians who are part of the Committee to Protect Health Care PAC, which has endorsed Harris, called on Trump to release his health plan, The Hill reported on October 16.\n\nReducing Prescription Drug Costs\n\nWhen it comes to holding down drug costs, Harris doesn\u2019t offer much that drug companies like. Trump, meanwhile, just doesn\u2019t offer much, period.\n\nHarris and Trump have taken different approaches over the years to reining in prescription drug costs. | Image: Pixabay photo\n\nThe centerpiece of the Biden-Harris agenda on drug costs was contained in the IRA of 2022, for which Harris famously cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate. The IRA created headline grabbers such as $35-a-month insulin for seniors\u2014something Harris wants to expand to commercial plans\u2014alongside vast new powers for HHS to negotiate Medicare drug costs and collect rebates if certain drug prices rise too quickly. These more labyrinthine elements, which have fueled cottage industries to determine which drugs will be targeted and manage Medicare\u2019s process, have drawn ire from pharma companies that say they are stifling innovation, delaying product launches, and triggering other unforeseen effects.\n\nThrough its trade association, PhRMA, the industry formally supports the other IRA bumper sticker\u2014the $2000 out-of-pocket cap for Medicare Part D, which starts in January 2025. But PhRMA released an analysis that says this benefit could be undermined by the IRA provisions for drug pricing negotiations.\n\nAs a candidate for president in 2019, Harris supported \u201cmarch-in\u201d rights, which allow the government to claim patents for drugs developed with federal research funds, thus making them more affordable. The Biden administration has not exercised march-in rights, and it has not been a focus in the current campaign.\n\nTrump has complained that the $35-per-month insulin was his idea and Biden and Harris have \u201cnothing to do with it.\u201d It\u2019s true that Trump\u2019s HHS created a voluntary model for Medicare plans to offer at least one formulation of the cheaper insulin, but the IRA made it the law for 3.4 million insulin users on Medicare.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has wavered on whether he will revive an idea seriously pursued during his term as president: use of a Most Favored Nation pricing model, meaning that high-cost, physician-administered Medicare Part B drugs would be available for the lowest price charged in other similar countries. A proposed rule sparked 4 industry lawsuits and was pulled after Biden took office.\n\nTrump also pushed for importing drugs from outside the US. He hasn\u2019t said whether he would continue IRA pricing talks; Harris has pointed out that Trump promised to introduce his own price negotiations but never did.\n\nHis remaining policy ideas are listed in a section of the campaign website, Agenda 47. The tone of the policy is negative toward the drug industry, stating that the rise of chronic illness among children must be \u201cinvestigated\u201d and connections to the pharmaceutical industry pursued: \u201cToo often, our public health establishment is too close to Big Pharma\u2014they make a lot of money, Big Pharma\u2014big corporations, and other special interests, and does not want to ask the tough questions about what is happening to our children\u2019s health.\u201d\n\nConsistent with his overall trade policy, Trump pledges to address drug shortages with a combination of tariffs, import restrictions, and domestic incentives to promote onshore drug manufacturing. His policy document lambasts \u201cthe extreme national vulnerability caused by the lack of an adequate domestic manufacturing capability for critical pharmaceuticals.\" To a degree, Trump\u2019s goal aligns with Democrats who reached the same conclusion in a 2023 report produced by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.\n\nHealth Care Consolidation, Costs, and Consumers\n\nTwo decades of mergers, first in the hospital sector and then among pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and health plans, are now considered a factor in driving up health care costs generally and drug costs in particular. The power of PBMs is now a bipartisan concern in the Congress, and action to bring more transparency may come during the lame duck session.\n\nUnder Biden-Harris, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has worked aggressively to block mergers and investigate PBM abuses; it recently sued the \u201cBig 3\u201d PBMs that control 85% of the market. At the same time, hospitals and physicians have complained that CMS could do more to enforce Medicare Advantage (MA) contracts that abuse prior authorization to limit access to services and drugs.\n\nThe Trump administration pushed through rules that require transparency in billing by hospitals. | Image: Pixabay\n\nIn his term as president, Trump pushed for loosening regulations to give providers more options for business flexibility, which would presumably put less pressure on practices to consolidate into hospital systems. Starting around 2010, oncology practices began creating on-site pharmacies to dispense increasingly complex therapies, and about a third of practices had pharmacies by the end of Trump\u2019s term. But as the pandemic lifted, Biden\u2019s CMS team reinterpreted the Stark Law, which bars self-referrals; practices were told that caregivers could no longer pick up prescriptions for patients, and practices must stop putting drugs in the mail to spare cancer patients a trip. This sent oncologists to Congress for legislation to undo CMS\u2019 action.\n\nOverall, both candidates have staked out consumer protection turf. As president, Harris would draw on her history as California Attorney General, when she battled hospitals, drug distributors, and insurers over antitrust issues. Amid the many mergers that occurred during that era, one didn\u2019t happen: Harris, representing the largest state, joined 11 others and the Department of Justice to stop a $48.6 billion merger of Anthem and Cigna. A lawsuit she started against Sutter Health to show that health system consolidation caused higher prices eventually led to a $575 million settlement for California. She also battled drug companies that tried to hold up introduction of low-cost generics.\n\nAs president, Trump adopted rules on hospital pricing transparency, which the Biden administration continued. And, under HHS Secretary Alex Azar, Trump pushed through rules to give patients access their own health data\u2014along with a requirement that it be downloadable to their phones. Patients\u2019 use of personal health data jumped 50% between 2020 and 2022, according to the Office of the National Coordinator of Health IT.\n\nMore recently, Harris has focused on the challenge of medical debt, announcing new rules to ban medical debt from credit reports. Trump\u2019s lack of specifics and past actions to allow low premium, high out-of-pocket health plans concerned a consumer advocate who spoke with NPR.\n\n\u201cPeople will face a wave of medical debt from paying premiums and prescription drug prices,\u201d Anthony Wright, executive director of Families USA, told the outlet. \u201cPatients and the public should be concerned.\u201d\n\nA Medicare Home Health Benefit\n\nOn October 8, 2024, Harris proposed what would be the first new major expansion of Medicare in a generation\u2014a home health benefit to help what the vice president called the \u201csandwich generation\u201d of adults taking care of both children and aging parents.\n\nHarris, who unveiled the proposal on the daytime program \u201cThe View,\u201d drew on her own experience caring for her mother, who died of cancer in 2009. \u201cThere are so many people who are right in the middle,\u201d she said.\n\nSo far, Harris pegs the annual price at $40 billion, to be paid for largely with the drug savings achieved under the IRA. KFF notes that amount doesn\u2019t factor in reduced spending at hospitals and nursing homes, where many seniors now end up when home health care is not an option.\n\nRight now, traditional Medicare only pays for home care that involves other care, such as physical therapy for a homebound senior. Medicaid will cover home care for elderly and disabled Americans who qualify, but beneficiaries must spend down all their savings first\u2014and as the Harris campaign notes on its website, some states then seize the family home to repay Medicaid after a person dies. Harris wants to end this as well.\n\nNot all analysts who have weighed in on Harris\u2019 plan think her cost estimate will hold up, and some say it shouldn\u2019t be offered through a universal benefit program such as Medicare.\n\nDetails of the program are not complete. \u201cMedicare will design a plan that provides coverage for those of modest incomes with a sliding scale for cost-sharing for seniors with higher incomes,\u201d a campaign statement said.\n\nFollowing Harris\u2019 announcement, the Trump campaign pointed to language in the 2024 GOP platform that includes a sentence, \u201cPresident Trump will prioritize home care benefits by shifting resources back to at-home senior care, overturning disincentives that lead to care worker shortages, and supporting unpaid family caregivers through tax credits and reduced red tape.\u201d There are no financing details.\n\nThe Trump campaign claimed that Medicare Part B premiums have seen their largest increase ever under Biden, and that Trump will do more to strengthen Medicare solvency. The Harris campaign warns this could mean Trump will revive earlier plans to push the retirement age to 70, as some Republicans support. But Trump's campaign insists he no longer supports this change.",

        "text": "Election forecast tracks a tight presidential race: School of Professional Studies\nModel updates election forecasts daily, driven by the betting market\n\nSeptember 11, 2024 \u2014 For the second U.S. presidential election in a row, a Northwestern University data scientist is running a novel forecasting platform that updates the odds of a win by former President Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris each day.\n\nWith this level of precision, followers can see how single events \u2014 such as a debate, campaign activities or legal rulings \u2014 might affect the potential outcome of the U.S. presidential election.\n\n\n\n\"A betting market isn\u2019t asking people to give an opinion ... but to put their money down.\"\n\n\n\nThomas Miller, Faculty Director SPS Data Science Programs\n\n\n\n\u201cTomorrow\u2019s debate is critical,\u201d said Northwestern\u2019s Thomas Miller, who developed the platform. \u201cTrump\u2019s legal events also are critical. There have been massive changes in forecasted Electoral College votes in recent months associated with current events and campaign activities.\u201d\n\nMiller is the faculty director of the master\u2019s in data science program at Northwestern\u2019s School of Professional Studies.\n\nViewers can follow his daily predictions and accompanying analysis on his site, The Virtual Tout.\n\nThis platform follows the money\n\nMiller\u2019s system uses data from PredictIt, prediction markets in which users bet real money on political races. He then uses pricing data as input to his forecast for how the Electoral College will vote.\n\nUsing his daily forecasts, Miller can gauge responses to singular news or campaign events. When Trump received a sentencing delay for his New York \u201chush money\u201d conviction, for example, Harris\u2019s campaign experienced a predicted drop of 68 forecasted electoral votes, according to Miller\u2019s model.\n\nAs of the time of this article, Miller\u2019s system predicts the Harris-Walz ticket will win the November election with 289 electoral votes. Candidates need 270 votes to win the presidency.\n\nMiller was nearly perfect in 2020\n\nMiller\u2019s models proved their uncanny accuracy during the 2020 presidential election \u2014 only predicting one state (Georgia) incorrectly. Miller has since learned from this error, uncovering innate biases that led to a Democratic Electoral College vote prediction that was 12 votes lower than the actual Electoral College vote.\n\n\u201cIn 2020, I was wrong on Georgia because I did not account for the Republican bias in prediction markets,\u201d Miller said. \u201cI have the data from the 2020 election to gauge the degree of bias in prediction markets and to correct for that bias, if necessary.\u201d\n\nRegardless of the incorrect prediction for Georgia, Miller\u2019s 2020 model was still more accurate than Nate Silver\u2019s FiveThirtyEight. While FiveThirtyEight predicted 348 electoral votes for Biden-Harris, Miller predicted 294 electoral votes for the Democratic ticket. Ultimately, the Electoral College cast 306 votes for Biden-Harris.\n\nMarkets are better than polls for a few reasons\n\nMiller says popular election forecasting systems, including FiveThirtyEight and The Economist\u2019s predictions project, are inherently flawed because they use data from opinion polls. According to Miller, these data are old, compared to fast-moving news cycles.\n\nMiller also notes another key advantage of prediction markets over political polls: Large groups of investors who stay in the markets until Election Day. These groups grow larger as Election Day approaches. Miller relies on prediction markets that have tens of thousands of investors, with thousands of shares traded each day. Typical opinion polls involve between one and two thousand respondents, with new respondents recruited for each poll.\n\n\u201cPrediction markets are more reliable than pollsters and pundits,\u201d Miller said. \u201cA betting market isn\u2019t asking people to give an opinion or preference but to put their money down. When you put your money down, you believe what you are betting on. You might not like the outcome, but you believe it will happen.\u201d\n\n\u2014 By Amanda Morris\n\nOctober 18, 2024\n\nT-Minus 17 Days to the Election, Miller Continues to Fine-Tune His Model\n\nGrowing national attention is focusing on Northwestern University data scientist Thomas Miller's election forecasting platform as the November presidential election approaches. Major media outlets, including the New York Times and Fortune, have recently highlighted Miller's unique approach to predicting electoral outcomes.\n\nThe Virtual Tout platform, which tracks daily betting market data, has seen a surge in visitors seeking real-time projections of the electoral showdown between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. The model\u2019s fundamental approach \u2014 following the money rather than the polling data used in traditional forecasting \u2014 remains unchanged from the 2020 election cycle, when it accurately predicted every state's outcome except Georgia. The Virtual Tout has become particularly relevant given the unprecedented nature of 2024\u2019s election cycle, in response to which Miller's team has enhanced the model's sensitivity to rapid political shifts. With the mid-campaign switch in Democratic nominees, Miller hopes that these refinements are enough to contend with his model\u2019s biggest test yet.\n\nAs of press time, Miller's model continues to show a competitive race, with daily updates reflecting the impact of campaign events, legal developments, and shifting political narratives in real-time. The Virtual Tout's growing influence in election forecasting demonstrates the increasing recognition of prediction markets as valuable tools for understanding electoral dynamics.\n\n\"Predicting the 2020 Presidential Election\" Data Science Webinar\n\nIn this webinar from November, 2020, Data science faculty director Thomas W. Miller explains how The Virtual Tout\u00ae model works. Miller also reviews results from the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThomas W. Miller is faculty director of the data science program in the School of Professional Studies at Northwestern University. Miller developed The Virtual Tout, a model driven by prediction market prices, providing forecasts of victory in the Electoral College.\n\n\n\nNorthwestern University School of Professional Studies offers many degree and certificate programs, with evening and online options available.

        "text": "Michigan swing state profile\nA quick guide to swing state Michigan\n\nBBC\n\nMichigan, famous for its Great Lakes, the Mustang and Madonna, is one of seven states that will decide the 2024 US presidential election. Voting in swing states is hard to predict and can swing Republican or Democrat - that\u2019s why you\u2019re hearing so much about them as campaigning draws to a close. Here\u2019s all you need to know.\n\nPopulation\n\n10.03m, same as Greece\n\nElectoral college votes\n\n15 of 538\n\nIn a nutshell\n\nMichigan helped propel Trump to victory in 2016, before Biden took the state back in 2020.\n\n2020 margin\n\nBiden by 150,000 votes\n\nWhat's the deal now?\n\nNeither Harris nor Trump is taking Michigan for granted in 2024. The candidates are focusing on Michigan\u2019s large auto industry as well as national issues such as the economy and immigration.\n\nWhat are voters saying?\n\nMichigan is home to a diverse group of voters, from its major city and Democratic stronghold of Detroit to its many rural Republican small towns. Much like elsewhere in the country, voters here are concerned about the rising cost of living. \u201cI\u2019ve never been able to even afford a house. I\u2019ve been waiting for years,\u201d said Darrell Sumpter, a 52-year-old who voted for Trump in 2020 and is leaning toward Harris this year. Detroit is the heart of the automotive industry in the US, making the issue top of mind for voters in the surrounding areas. The war in the Middle East also hits close to home in Michigan, which has the largest Arab-American population in the US.\n\nWhat's the expert view?\n\nPolitical scientists say Democrats are focusing on building up support in the state\u2019s largest left-leaning counties, Oakland, Washtenaw and Wayne, while the Trump campaign tries to chip away at votes in swing districts like Macomb County, relying on rural support. Democrats are also trying to win back voters who veered toward Trump when he won in 2016. \u201cWhite, non-college voters, manual workers, lots of people who are traditionally affiliated with unions\u2026 have been moving towards Republicans,\u201d says Michigan State University professor of political science Matt Grossmann. Both sides are focused on Michigan\u2019s swing voters, a group that is frustrated by inflation and is typically made up of \u201clower middle-class or working-class voters who just don't really pay attention to politics on a daily basis,\u201d says University of Michigan political scientist Jonathan Hanson.\n\nWhat to watch out for on election night",

        "text": "U.S.-Iran policy: What are the challenges and opportunities for the next president?\nIn the run-up to the presidential election, Brandeis Stories asked university faculty to provide expert analysis and insight into some of the issues raised during this campaign season.\n\nRegardless of who wins the November election the next U.S. president will face very difficult challenges in dealing with the Islamic Republic of Iran. More than three decades of economic sanctions have severely weakened Iran\u2019s economy but the Islamic regime has not altered its anti-Western foreign policy, and the Gaza war has sharply increased the risk of a full-scale confrontation between Iran and Israel.\n\nThe next president must take four important developments into account as he or she formulates U.S. policy toward Iran. First, Iran is expected to continue its support for Hamas, Hezbollah, and Houthis who are currently fighting against Israel, despite the fact that these groups have suffered severe setbacks in recent weeks. This support has brought Iran and Israel closer to a direct confrontation, which the U.S. wants to contain. The continuation of this conflict will also increase the risk of a direct military confrontation between the U.S. and Iran, beyond the current anti-missile defensive operations of the U.S. military.\n\nSecond, the collapse of the nuclear agreement and escalation of tensions with Israel have increased Iran\u2019s incentive to develop a nuclear weapon. Iran has already reached a high level of uranium enrichment and, according to Western experts, can build a nuclear bomb within a few months, though a political decision for taking the remaining steps has not yet been made. Since the U.S. is determined to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, the next U.S. president will have to decide on the mix of sanctions, incentives, and military threats that can prevent Iran from completing the final stage.\n\nThird, the pressure of economic sanctions and the relentless attempts of the U.S. and its allies to isolate Iran have pushed Iran closer to Russia and China. Economic relations dominate Iran\u2019s relations with China, which buys nearly 90% of Iran\u2019s clandestine crude oil exports. China is also the main source of imports that many other countries refuse to sell to Iran because of the economic sanctions.\n\nIran\u2019s relations with Russia are even more worrisome for the U.S. The bilateral Iran-Russia relations are more oriented toward strategic and military cooperation as both countries are targets of severe Western sanctions. Iran has supported Russia\u2019s war efforts in Ukraine by exporting inexpensive drones and short-range missiles, in return for advanced weapons such as jet fighters and air defense systems. Both China and Russia have also welcomed Iran into BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization; these opportunities have further reduced Iran\u2019s international isolation. China has also brokered a rapprochement between Iran and Saudi Arabia. The next U.S. president must take into account the roles of Russia and China in diminishing the effectiveness of Western attempts to isolate Iran.\n\nFourth, the election of Masoud Pezeshkian as Iran\u2019s president has created a window of opportunity for a reduction in hostilities with the U.S. Among Iran\u2019s political elite, Pezeshkian is considered a moderate but his role in Iran\u2019s foreign policy is subordinate to the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. The fact that Khamenei endorsed and facilitated Pezeshkian\u2019s presidency, however, implies that Khamenei is also supportive of a rapprochement that can reduce the pressure of economic sanctions on Iran\u2019s economy. So far Pezeshkian has focused on a \u201cglobal engagement\u201d with Iran\u2019s neighbors and Asian countries, but he has not taken any action to reduce the tensions with the U.S., partly because this issue remains fully under the purview of Khamenei.\n\nThe history of U.S.-Iran relations in the past four decades suggests that the outcome of the U.S. election matters for the American policy toward Iran. As noticed by some observers, there have been two periods of rapprochement between Iran and the U.S. and on both occasions a moderate Iranian president coincided with a Democrat U.S. president (Bill Clinton-Mohammad Khatami (1998-2004); and Barack Obama-Hassan Rouhani (2012-2015)).\n\nHence a Harris presidency, which is likely to continue President Biden\u2019s Iran policies, will have a better chance to reduce the level of hostilities through a new agreement, in comparison to a Trump presidency. Based on Trump\u2019s policies toward Iran during his administration, his presidency could result in more sanctions and other pressures on Iran. Either president will have to take complex factors into account, and both are expected to take measures to reduce the security and military risk that Iran poses to Israel.",

        "text": "Czechia Can Live With Harris Continuity or \u201cTrump Therapy\u201d\nThe US presidential election is the top geopolitical event of the year for Czechia. When it comes to the foreign and security policy agenda, no other development is a match for a country so keen on promoting transatlantic cooperation. And here the stakes are high given the developments in the war in Ukraine, where Russia has been making territorial gains in recent weeks.\n\nAt the beginning of the presidential campaign, most Czech observers of US politics were frustrated that Americans had to choose between President Joe Biden and Donald Trump. They saw both as ageing, known quantities offering little novelty to Washington\u2019s allies. Thus, many were happy with the change of candidate on the Democratic side to Kamala Harris, whom they see as a more different option and an escape from the \u201clesser evil\u201d choice for the US electorate.\n\nHowever, from the perspective of foreign and security policy, there are many question marks concerning both candidates. Harris\u2019s limited record and the lack of clarity as to who would constitute her team in these matters are considered a problem. Czech observers also wonder how many members of Biden\u2019s cabinet would sit in hers too. Prague has seen the current administration as often too weak to act, not only against Russia but also to confront other authoritarian powers such as China and Iran.\n\nBy contrast, Czechia probably has too much information about Trump for its liking, remembering some of his erratic behavior on Russia, North Korea, and NATO during his presidency, not to mention his record in domestic politics. On the other hand, under the Trump administration, the United States paid a lot of attention to Central and Eastern Europe, even if often over the heads of the rest of the continent.\n\nIn that context, Czechia\u2019s government is somewhat split on which candidate it would like to see win but keen on working with whoever does. The same goes for President Petr Pavel. Over the last several months, he and some government representatives have done as much outreach as possible to key figures in the Republican Party to establish ties in case of a Trump victory.\n\nTo Czechia\u2019s advantage, it clearly aligns itself with important US interests on most fronts, including by being a reliable ally to Israel, by strongly criticizing China and supporting Taiwan, and by doing everything possible to support Ukraine. The country is also trying to lead Europe toward taking more responsibility in security. This was seen in the common initiative for ammunition purchases that has delivered hundreds of thousands of artillery shells for Ukraine\u2019s defense while the country was waiting for the US package of financial support and military equipment that was approved earlier this year. Crucially, Czechia is ready to be an ally in confronting China\u2019s influence and assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific, making use of all its assets in the region. This could be key especially if there is a new Trump administration.\n\nAt first sight, it seems things would be easier for Prague with Harris in the White House.\n\nOne thing is clear for Czechia: whoever is elected president needs to be committed to Europe and the transatlantic partnership. The nightmare scenario for the country would be polarization, division, and confrontation in the transatlantic community, including on energy, trade, and security\u2014three key elements for Czechia. This would threaten Czech interests, considering Russia\u2019s aggression toward not only Ukraine but also the rest of a region that faces the immediate consequences of the war.\n\nAt first sight, it seems things would be easier for Prague with Harris in the White House. From an initial analysis of her priorities and based on the presence of some people in her campaign team, she would represent continuity more than Trump, even if with some changes to the current US policy. This would be significant for Czechia as a country with a strong multilateralist mindset at a time when the world order is being challenged by the erosion of global institutions and attempts to undermine the status quo.\n\nHowever, many people in Czechia\u2019s security establishment have started speaking about the possible benefits for Europe of a \u201cTrump therapy\u201d. In their view, a more assertive tone from Washington in discussions with the EU could finally help European countries wake up to the existing challenges and to put their house in order. This would apply to the internal reform agenda in the EU, to necessary military investments to boost the continent\u2019s defense, and to establishing a clearer line in trade and external partnerships, where the EU has been backtracking on its global agenda.\n\nIn any case, the coming US presidential election has already had consequences, as seen in the EU\u2019s agenda to become more self-sufficient in some of the abovementioned areas. Czechia sees positively the recent boost in the EU\u2019s security and defense agenda with the newly created European commissioner for defense and the appointment of Lithuania\u2019s former prime minister Andrius Kubilius.\n\nRegardless of who wins the election, even more is needed from Europe, including in terms of investing in the EU\u2019s means to be a good ally to the United States. There also needs to be reciprocity from Washington, especially when it comes to regions of common interest, such as Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and the Western Balkans, where competition and conflicts with Europe emerged during the first Trump presidency. Czechia and Europe cannot afford a repeat of this, especially if Trump wins, in the context of the intensified global power confrontation, which should bring the two sides of the Atlantic closer.\n\nPavel Havlicek is a ReThink.CEE Fellow 2019 of the German Marshall Fund of the United States.\n\nThis article is part of series in which GMF experts from Central and Eastern Europe set out the implications of a Harris or Trump win in the US presidential election for the countries in the region.",

        "text": "This Wisconsin county has backed the winning presidential candidate for the last 6 elections\nDoor County, Wisconsin: Where voters have backed the presidential winner for years\n\nFor all the polarization in American politics, everyone can agree that seven states hold the key to next month's election. These swing states contain a total of 513 counties, and among them only one has voted for the winning candidate in every presidential election this century. Door County, Wisconsin, offers a distinct shade of purple. Unencumbered by tribal loyalties, the citizenry has whipsawed from George W. Bush twice to Barack Obama twice; to Donald Trump and then to Joe Biden... consider Door a window into this critical election. Feverishly, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris have been campaigning in swing states, especially Wisconsin. But neither has visited America's swingiest county. So, we decided to.\n\nThe Wisconsin tourism board could do worse than to anchor its next marketing campaign in Door County, the peninsula wedged between Lake Michigan and Green Bay\u2013 the water not the home of the Packers\u2026. nicknamed \"the Cape Cod of the Midwest,\" Door County and its coastline come embroidered with limestone cliffs, trees that blaze to life in the fall and enduring traditions like the fish boil.\n\nThe population: 30,000\u2026.and no one knows more of the locals than 84-year-old Niles Weborg, long-time fire chief\u2026\n\nJon Wertheim:: Tell me about Door County\u2026\n\nNiles Weborg: How far do you want to go back? My relatives landed here, in 1851, from Norway\u2026\n\nWeborg has a handy way of placing Door County on Wisconsin's map\u2026\n\nNiles Weborg: And, uh, this is where we're at. Door County is up the thumb of Wisconsin. And Nor, Green Bay is down here. Milwaukee is down here. And we're right about here on the Peninsula.\n\nJon Wertheim: So we got, we got a bay side. And we got a Lake Michigan side.\n\nNiles Weborg: There you go.\n\nJon Wertheim: Tell me, politically, what are people like.\n\nNiles Weborg: Well, politically, we were strictly Republicans.\n\nBut then the transplants came and now Door County is the ultimate political weathervane\u2026. in 2020, Joe Biden carried Door County by 292 votes\u2026the tightest margin in any Wisconsin county.\n\nJoel Kitchens: And it's not just the presidential elections. It's virtually every state-wide election, we seem to pick the winner. It's, it's kind of weird.\n\nJoel Kitchens 60 Minutes\n\nRepublican Joel Kitchens represents Door County in the State Assembly.\n\nJon Wertheim: What do you attribute that to?\n\nJoel Kitchens: I think a lot of it is that we are such a cross section of the state that we have a lot of people that came from the cities and from the suburbs and retired. We have a strong agricultural community. We have heavy manufacturing, and as you can see when you drive along the lake shore and the bay shore, there's a lotta money here. But there are also a lot of people that are really struggling as well.\n\nOn our road trip through Door County last week, we saw this first hand. The county is 92% White, but politically diverse. In the rural south: abundant signs for Donald Trump and towering silos\u2026.\n\n25-year-old Austin Vandertie is a sixth-generation dairy farmer.\n\nJon Wertheim: When you go into that voting booth, first Tuesday in November, what is the one issue that's most going to impact how you vote?\n\nAustin Vandertie: Inflation. You know, inflation affects the cost of my feed, my fuel, my seed, my fertilizer, everything that it takes for me to grow a crop and feed it to my cows to get a good product.\n\nLike many of his neighbors, Vandertie is voting for Trump. But as we headed north, cows and deer blinds gave way to artists and rainbow flags...\n\nNear the top of the thumb in Door County, in the tourist town of Sister Bay\u2014where red gives ground to blue\u2014we met Emma Cox, who runs Kindgoods, a new-age boutique.\n\nEmma Cox speaks with Jon Wertheim 60 Minutes\n\nJon Wertheim: For this election, what is gonna be the issue that you're most concerned about?\n\nEmma Cox: I think the issue that has been driving the-- work of activism that I've been doing for the last two years has been reproductive rights.\n\nCharming as her little pocket of America might be, she understands: Door County may be the leading indicator in this most contentious election.\n\nEmma Cox: Well, it feels like all eyes are on us. All eyes are on Wisconsin, all eyes have been on Door County. And it feels like there's pressure for us to deliver. (laugh)\n\nInasmuch as you can have a bellwether town within a bellwether county, Sturgeon Bay is Door's gravitational and political center. Shipbuilding is the big industry here. Sensibilities vary from one yard to the next\u2026\n\nEven the animals get into the act\n\nJon Wertheim: Tell me who we have here?\n\nJohn Vincent: This is Ziva. She's our dog for democracy.\n\nWe met Ziva, as well as her owners, John and Annette Vincent, who organized a pop-up rally, flanking both sides of the main drag in Sturgeon Bay, drumming up support for the Democratic ticket\u2026. and this is where shabby stereotypes come to die\u2026.\n\nAnnette and John Vincent with their dog Ziva 60 Minutes\n\nJon Wertheim: I saw a truck with a gun rack honk and I saw a Prius--\n\nJohn Vincent: Yes.\n\nJon Wertheim: --go by and give you a thumbs down--\n\nJohn Vincent: Isn't that interesting--\n\nAnnette Vincent: Isn't that interesting\u2013\n\nJohn Vincent: It's more than just coincidental. We're s-- we're so (truck honking) on the edge that we're--\n\nAnnette Vincent: I mean, here comes a truck.\n\nJohn Vincent: Whoa--\n\nJon Wertheim: On cue.\n\nAnnette Vincent: We-- we have--\n\nJohn Vincent: We're purple.\n\nJon Wertheim: On cue--\n\nJohn Vincent: We're purple--\n\nAnnette Vincent: We-- we are very purple. That is our impression from moving up here, is that we are very, very purple.\n\nNow retired, they relocated from Chicago. They come three days a week not just to rally, but to gauge the political winds swirling off the bay\u2026.\n\nJon Wertheim: What's a positive response look like?\n\nJohn Vincent: Well, positive response can be anything from just a nod of the head to an enthusiastic wave, a horn honk-- a solid horn honk-- thumbs up\n\nJon Wertheim: You have data on raised thumbs versus raised middle fingers?\n\nJohn Vincent: Well, that happens, too--\n\nAnnette Vincent: Oh, we get those too.\n\nJohn Vincent: But I would say on-- keep-- you know, I have a pretty good sample size, and we run well over 80% positive to the negative.\n\nCharles Franklin 60 Minutes\n\nFor a more scientific assessment of the entire state of Wisconsin, we turned to the director of the Marquette Law School poll, Charles Franklin. His poll, widely considered Wisconsin's best, currently has Kamala Harris up four\u2014but, not so fast\u2026.\n\nJon Wertheim: What is it like being a pollster these days?\n\nCharles Franklin: It's challenging, because we've seen polling errors in 2016 and 2020. And those were major issues.\n\nMemorably, in 2016 and 2020, most polls\u2014CBS included\u2014 fell short when accounting for the Trump vote.\n\nJon Wertheim: There's something specific, particular to Trump that makes his support hard to capture.\n\nCharles Franklin: In these four most recent elections, the two big errors have both come when Trump's on the ballot. And the two elections without him on the ballot, we've been as good or better than our long term average.\n\nJon Wertheim: Say more about why you think that is.\n\nCharles Franklin: The people that Trump mobilizes to vote really do turn out for him. But they seem to drop out of the electorate in the midterm.\n\nBrian Schimming: My suspicion is it keeps the Kamala Harris campaign up all night long.\n\nBrian Schimming 60 Minutes\n\nJon Wertheim: That there's this cohort that hasn't been capturable.\n\nBrian Schimming: Correct.\n\nBrian Schimming, Wisconsin's Republican Party chair, is shaking the trees to identify those hidden Trump voters\u2026 and, crucially, get them to the polls.\n\nJon Wertheim: How many potential Trump supporters are there in Wisconsin who have never voted before?\n\nBrian Schimming: Well, I spoke at President Trump's rally the other day, and I said to the folks there, \"Look, there are hundreds of thousands of people in this state who think like us, they act like us, they live like us, they believe like us, but they don't vote.\" And I truly believe that.\n\nJon Wertheim: Is it risky to rely on this sector, these low-propensity voters who have been so unreliable in the past?\n\nBrian Schimming: It's risky not to.\n\nFor the Democrats the strategy entails running up the numbers in Milwaukee\u2026. and booming Dane County - home to Madison, the state capitol and the University of Wisconsin - where Biden won more than 75% of the vote in 2020\u2026. meanwhile, they'll try to stanch the bleeding in rural swaths that have swung heavily towards Trump\u2026.\n\nBen Wikler - state Democratic Party chair - thinks it's a complete jump ball right now for Wisconsin's 10 electoral votes.\n\nBen Wikler: So on Election Night, expect to stay up very late. And when you find out who won Wisconsin, which might happen at 4:00 in the morning, you probably know who won the presidential election.\n\nJon Wertheim: It's that pivotal?\n\nBen Wikler: Wisconsin was the state that tipped the Electoral College for Donald Trump in 2016. There is every possibility that Wisconsin could tip the presidential election again in 2024.\n\nBen Wikler 60 Minutes\n\nWisconsin was decided by less than 1% in the last two elections. But get this: around 80% of the state's counties were decided by a double digit margin\u2026 which only magnifies Door County's uncanny distinction.\n\nBen Wikler: I think in Door County this election's almost perfectly tied as well. I was just looking at the county-by-county data before I joined you today. Whoever wins Door County on Election Day probably wins the state of Wisconsin yet again.\n\nJon Wertheim: You say whoever wins Door County likely wins Wisconsin. You also just said whoever wins Wisconsin likely wins the national election.\n\nBen Wikler: Yes--\n\nJon Wertheim: Not an exaggeration.\n\nBen Wikler: But--\n\nJon Wertheim: Door County, Wisconsin--\n\nBen Wikler: --historically the case. Whoever wins in Door County is probably the next president of the United States.\n\nIt got us thinking, is there one person in Door County who's actually picked the winning candidate in each of the last six presidential elections?.....The county did collectively; but did any single voter? If so, finding this mystery figure might provide a heck of a clue into how this presidential election will go\u2026. So we went on a search\u2026.\n\nWe started with an APB at the local radio station\u2026\n\nTIM KOWOLS: If you or someone you know in Door County has voted for the presidential winner of every election going back to the year 2000, please reach out to 920\u2026\n\nBut no response\u2026. from the airwaves to the rooftops, Al Johnson's swedish restaurant is best known for the goats that graze on the grass roof\u2026\n\nInside, we found the locals who beat the sunrise and the tourists, let themselves in through the back door and pour their own coffee\u2026\n\nJon Wertheim: Do you know anyone that's voted for presidents six straight years now and gotten it right?\n\nMale Voice (unidentified): No. No--\n\nFemale Voice (unidentified): No. (laughter)\n\nWe were told to go to another table and ask the guy in the hat\u2026\n\nJon Wertheim: We got a hot tip it was\u2026\n\nMale Voice (unidentified): No, I had some of them. George H. W. was-- was my vote. But-- not his son.\n\nNext stop in our pursuit, the local watering hole.\n\nJon Wertheim: Do you know that person?\n\nFemale Voice: I'm out.\n\nFemale Voice: I did not.\n\nFemale Voice: You have your work cut out for you. (laughter)\n\nThen suddenly: a promising lead\u2026\n\nFemale Voice: I hear you found your voter. (laughter)\n\nJon Wertheim: Seriously?\n\nFemale Voice: Right over there. He's down there--\n\nJon Wertheim: Seriously?\n\nThere at the end of the bar\u2026sitting before something called a Badger Melt and a tall glass of milk\u2014trucker, Joe Conlon.\n\nJon Wertheim: Bush, Bush, Obama, Obama, Trump, Biden.\n\nJoe Conlon: I came close. Five out of six.\n\nJon Wertheim and Joe Conlon 60 Minutes\n\nJon Wertheim: Five out of six?\n\nJoe Conlon: Yeah. Yeah, I didn't vote for Biden.\n\nJon Wertheim: Can I ask you how you're\u2013gonna be votin' this year?\n\nJoe Conlon:: I think I'm gonna be voting for Trump again.\n\nJon Wertheim: Three times in a row?\n\nJoe Conlon:: Yes.\n\nWe had come agonizingly close\u2026\n\nOur last stop: the Rotary Club of Sturgeon Bay.\n\n\n\nJon Wertheim: I'm curious: does anyone know someone, a voter, who actually voted for the winning candidate all six years? Anyone?\n\nFemale Voice: I think I did. (laughter) Now that you ask the question, yes, I think I did.\n\nBehold! our Door County unicorn\u2026.\n\nFemale Voice: No, no, now-- no, I didn't, now that I'm thinking about it. (laughter)\n\nJon Wertheim: We thought you had all six?\n\nFemale Voice: I thought I did. But, no, now I'm thinking back, I didn't.\n\nAfter scouring Door County, we came up empty\u2026 which shows the improbability of it all\u2026\n\nBut in our quest, maybe we stumbled across something even more rare, we found a place in America where family and community outrank party loyalty. In this divisive election season, we came to America's ultimate battleground\u2026.except there was no battle \u2026 as they say here with pride, we live above the tension line.\n\nJon Wertheim: What's your sense of how the tone in Door County compares to the tone nationally?\n\nEmma Cox: You don't wanna alienate your neighbors. You don't wanna alienate your fellow business owners. You all come together.\n\nJon Wertheim: Do you have family members that are gonna vote differently from you?\n\nAustin Vandertie 60 Minutes\n\nAustin Vandertie: Oh, absolutely.\n\nJon Wertheim: Everyone invited to Thanksgiving, regardless?\n\nAustin Vandertie: Absolutely. Politics is, you know, if we can't talk about it that means it's gone way too far in the wrong direction.\n\nJon Wertheim: You recognize that's not necessarily the, the vibe in the country at large?\n\nAustin Vandertie: Hey. We're a little different in Wisconsin, I guess. We got that Midwest nice going on.\n\nIn keeping with the undulations of Highway 42, in Door County, Wisconsin, you swing back and forth and continue on down the road.\n\nProduced by Draggan Mihailovich.

        "text": "Elon Musk's $1m-a-day giveaway in swing states 'deeply concerning'\nMusk's $1m-a-day to swing states voters 'deeply concerning'\n\nWatch: Elon Musk gives $1m to a rally attendee\n\nThe first lottery-style cheque was given away to a surprised attendee at a town hall event in Pennsylvania on Saturday night. Another cheque was handed out on Sunday.\n\nThe winner will be chosen at random from those who sign a pro-US Constitution petition by Mr Musk\u2019s campaign group America PAC, which he set up to support Republican nominee Donald Trump's bid to return to the White House.\n\nTech billionaire Elon Musk has said he will give away $1m (\u00a3766,000) a day to a registered voter in key swing states until the US presidential election on 5 November.\n\nHow Musk and Trump put aside their differences\n\nShapiro told NBC News' Meet the Press that law enforcement should potentially look at the payments.\n\nThe contest is open to voters in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin and North Carolina, all key battleground states that will ultimately decide the White House election.\n\nElection law expert Rick Hasen wrote on his personal Election Law Blog that he believed Mr Musk's offer was \"clearly illegal\".\n\nFederal law states that anyone who \"pays or offers to pay or accepts payment either for registration to vote or for voting\" faces a potential $10,000 fine or a five-year prison sentence.\n\nThough Mr Musk is technically asking voters to sign a form, Mr Hasen questioned the intent behind the strategy.\n\n\"Who can sign the petitions? Only registered voters in swing states, which is what makes it illegal,\" said Mr Hasen, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) law school.\n\nThose who sign the petition - which pledges to support free speech and gun rights - must submit their contact details, potentially allowing America PAC to contact them about their vote.\n\nBoth Mr Musk and America PAC have been approached for comment.\n\nCampaigns and political action committees rely on tactics like petition signing, survey requests, or merchandise purchases to build massive databases of voter information. That data can then be used more accurately to target voters, or raise funds from supporters who are already onboard.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, Mr Musk is giving voters $100 for signing the petition, plus another $100 for each person they refer who signs. Voters in other battleground states get $47 per referral.\n\nBut the strategy may be covered by a loophole under US election law because no-one is being directly paid to vote - despite introducing money into a process that could identify likely Trump voters.\n\nIn the US, it is illegal to provide payments to get people to vote - not only for a certain candidate, but to simply cast a ballot.\n\nThe rule prompted icecream-maker Ben & Jerry's to give its product free to everyone on election day in 2008, having initially planned to limit it just to those with an \"I voted\" sticker.\n\nWhile campaigning on Sunday, Trump was asked about Mr Musk's giveaway.\n\n\"I haven't followed that,\" he said, adding that he speaks to Mr Musk often and he is a \"friend\".\n\nThe founder of SpaceX and Tesla and owner of X, formerly Twitter, has emerged as a key Trump supporter.\n\nMr Musk launched America PAC in July with the aim of supporting the former president's campaign.\n\nHe has so far donated $75m (\u00a357.5m) to the group, which has quickly become a central player in Trump's election bid.\n\nThe Trump campaign is highly reliant on outside groups such as America PAC to canvas voters.\n\nA statement on the group's website reads: \u201cAmerica PAC was created to support these key values: Secure Borders, Safe Cities, Sensible spending, Fair Justice System, Free Speech, Right to Self-Protection.\u201d\n\nMr Musk said he wants to get \u201cover a million, maybe two million, voters in the battleground states to sign the petition in support of the First and Second Amendment\u201d.\n\n\u201cI think [it] sends a crucial message to our elected politicians,\u201d he added.\n\nMr Musk is currently the world's richest man, with an estimated net worth of $248bn (\u00a3191bn), according to US business magazine Forbes.",

        "text": "What impact will Taylor Swift really have on the US election?\nWhat impact could Taylor Swift really have on the US election?\n\nBBC\n\nNoel Drake, a 29-year-old who lives in Utah, said she felt \u201cvery bleak\u201d about politics before this year. During the 2020 presidential election, she felt disillusioned entirely. But Taylor Swift \u2013 and her fans \u2013 helped change her mind, she told me. \u201cWith this sense of community that I have established through interacting with other Swifties online, it has really changed the way I interact with politics this election cycle,\u201d she said. After Swift endorsed Democratic nominee Kamala Harris a month ago, Ms Drake started following a fan-led campaign group called \u201cSwifties for Kamala\". The group is not officially affiliated with the Harris campaign, but does keep in regular touch with campaign staff. Since interacting with other like-minded Swifties, Ms Drake has decided to get more involved in local campaigning in her home state. The BBC has tracked down dozens of voters like Ms Drake, who say posts from Swift and her mega fans on social media have motivated them to go out and vote, or get involved in activism. But just because you\u2019re a fan of Swift doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to vote like her, I learned. For the latest episode of BBC Radio 4\u2019s Why Do You Hate Me USA, I\u2019ve been investigating how one pop-inclined meme enthusiast Irene Kim - the co-founder of Swifties for Kamala - found herself transformed from superfan to political strategist. Have any of the tactics used by her and her fellow activists actually worked?\n\nWatch on BBC iPlayer (UK Only) Are Swifties Shaping America?\n\nOver the past month, I\u2019ve messaged several accounts who like and comment on the Swifties for Kamala posts. Although some people were already Democrat supporters, others weren\u2019t so sure. Take 27-year-old Destiny from South Carolina, who doesn\u2019t want to share her surname. She said both her and her boyfriend are \u201cnot that political,\u201d but that the Swifties for Kamala posts have helped support her reasoning for voting for the Democrats this election. \u201cI really want a woman president who has similar values to me. This is my first election that has pushed me to vote for this reason,\u201d she said. Even her boyfriend, whom she described as \u201cmoderately conservative\u201d, has been swayed to vote for Harris, and she said it was in part inspired by her lobbying based on some Swifties for Kamala posts.\n\nIrene Kim Irene Kim is the co-founder of \"Swifties for Kamala\"\n\nPart of the appeal of a celebrity endorsement \u2013 and the political content generated by their fandoms \u2013 is that unlike paid-for adverts, this kind of user-generated content feels genuine. A study from Harvard Kennedy School that looked at the impact of celebrities when it comes to voter registration found their \u201cauthenticity\u201d can be key when motivating people to go out and vote. Its author, Ashley Spillane, told the BBC celebrities are among the \u201cmost well-positioned members of society\u201d when it comes to dealing with causes of voter apathy, such as \u201clack of information, lack of trust and lack of motivation\u201d. \u201cPeople know them from places outside of politics, which makes their involvement feel deeper and less self-interested,\u201d she said. Within 24 hours of Swift\u2019s Harris endorsement on Instagram, nearly 340,000 people had visited vote.gov, a registration website, using a custom link she created. While Harris has enjoyed endorsements from Swift, Beyonce and some other big-name celebrities, Trump is not without his fans either. Endorsements from Kid Rock, Elon Musk, John Voight and YouTubers the Nelk Boys may help him reach young men in the same way that Swift's endorsement has boosted Harris's profile with young women. Trump\u2019s own committed supporters online also operate a bit like a fandom. Endorsements can backfire, however, polls show. A Quinnipiac University poll from late September found that Swift\u2019s endorsement of Harris made 9% of respondents \u201cmore enthusiastic\u201d about her candidacy, while it made 13% \u201cless enthusiastic\u201d. It also looked at how Musk\u2019s endorsement affected respondents\u2019 views of Trump - 13% felt more enthusiastic, while 21% felt less. Ultimately, we won\u2019t know exactly what impact celebrities - and their fandoms - will have on this election until after November. In what looks to be a very closely fought election, it\u2019s these groups of online supporters who could motivate voters to head to the polls \u2013 especially in swing states where the winner may be decided by just thousands of votes. Ms Kim, the co-founder of Swifties for Kamala, told me the group is targeting people in swing states especially. Peggy Rowe is in Arizona, one of the most closely watched states in the election. She told me it was Harris\u2019s support for abortion rights that strengthened her to support for the vice-president. \u201cI\u2019m very passionate about reproductive rights and social media has further confirmed my opinions,\u201d she said. While they're employing all the traditional political campaign methods, Swifties for Kamala has put a fan-specific twist on their efforts. Whenever they're at events, they give out friendship bracelets featuring political slogans like \u201cin my voting era\u201d. It's a nod to Swift's Eras tour, where fans have been trading Swift-themed friendship bracelets as a sign of being a true fan. Ms Kim said they\u2019d begun face-to-face campaigning a few weeks ago, and have been calling and texting followers directly. They aim to have 22 million direct voter contacts in total by Election Day. The Swifties for Kamala group has raised over $200,000 (\u00a3153,000) for Harris's campaign, as of the middle of October, she estimated.",

        "text": "Financial markets tend to become erratic as polling data, debates and breaking news affect market sentiment\nBy Nigel Green\n\nWith the US presidential election fast approaching, investors are facing a heightened sense of uncertainty.\n\nAs markets react to the political shifts and speculations that surround election season, many are tempted to take advantage of potential market swings in hopes of quick profits.\n\nAlso Read Broader market riskier due to weak earnings What to watch for this week: Maharashtra elections, upcoming IPOs, Zinka Logistics listing and lot more India and the US elections Markets continue to decline, Nifty, Sensex slip nearly 1 per cent: What\u2019s worrying investors at the moment?\n\nHowever, trading an election, especially one as unpredictable as this, comes with significant risks that could lead to substantial losses. While the allure of profiting from short-term market movements may be strong, the dangers involved in election-driven trading should give investors pause.\n\nOne of the primary risks associated is extreme market volatility.\n\nFinancial markets tend to become more erratic as polling data, debates, and breaking news affect market sentiment.\n\nThis heightened volatility can lead to dramatic price swings, and the reality is that market reactions are often far from predictable.\n\nIn past elections, markets have defied expectations, catching many traders off guard. In the 2016 US election, for example, many predicted that a Trump victory would lead to a significant market sell-off. However, the opposite occurred as markets rallied sharply after his win, leaving those who bet on a downturn facing steep losses.\n\nThis unpredictability highlights one of the key dangers of election trading: political uncertainty can overshadow market fundamentals.\n\nDuring an election, investors often find themselves reacting to political headlines rather than focusing on a company\u2019s underlying business performance or long-term value.\n\nThis can result in impulsive decision-making, where people abandon carefully considered strategies in favour of short-term trades based on speculative scenarios.\n\nYet, the political landscape can change rapidly, and the policies proposed during a campaign often take time to be implemented \u2013 if they materialize at all.\n\nLegislative gridlock, a divided government, or shifting priorities can prevent key policies from being enacted, which means investors who trade based on expected political outcomes may be left waiting far longer than anticipated for their investments to pay off.\n\nAdding to the complexity is the fact that polls and predictions are frequently wrong.\n\nRelying on polling data as a basis for making trades is a risky endeavour. The US 2016 election and the Brexit vote are stark reminders of how polls can mislead investors.\n\nDespite widespread confidence in a Clinton win, Trump\u2019s victory came as a shock to many, leading to unexpected market reactions. Political polls can swing wildly in response to short-term factors like debates or scandals, but these swings don\u2019t always reflect the broader electorate\u2019s eventual choices.\n\nThe temptation to use leverage \u2013 borrowing money to increase the size of a trade \u2013 during these periods of volatility is another danger. Leverage can amplify both gains and losses, making it a particularly risky strategy when markets are unpredictable.\n\nA single wrong move in a highly volatile environment can wipe out an entire investment, or worse, trigger margin calls that force investors to sell at a loss. For those less experienced with managing risk in volatile markets, the use of leverage can turn what might have been a manageable loss into a financial disaster.\n\nTrading on emotion during election periods is yet another pitfall.\n\nThe constant media coverage, the stakes involved, and the volatility of the markets can create a high-stress environment, leading to emotional decision-making.\n\nWhen investors trade based on fear or excitement rather than rational analysis, they\u2019re more likely to make mistakes. This emotional rollercoaster can also cause investors to lose sight of their long-term goals, making reactive decisions that undermine their overall investment strategy.\n\nEven after the election results are known, uncertainty doesn\u2019t necessarily fade either.\n\nThe ability of the winning candidate to implement their proposed policies depends on many factors, including the composition of Congress and the broader economic environment.\n\nThose who expect immediate policy changes might be disappointed to find that legislative delays, compromises, or gridlock prevent significant reforms from taking place.\n\nInvestors should approach election season with caution, maintaining focus on their long-term strategies rather than being swayed by short-term political noise.\n\n(Author is deVere Group CEO and Founder)\n\nDisclaimer: Views, recommendations, and opinions expressed are personal and do not reflect the official position or policy of FinancialExpress.com.

Maybe it might in some precinct but that is very rare.\n\nThis upcoming election is all the more reason I am not voting. The reason is that we have two bad candidates to choose from. What sense does it make to choose the lesser of two evils. I cannot in good conscience vote for one of these two. Why?\n\nDo you want Donald Trump to be president? He is a felon. He lies all of the time. He plays too much golf. He exaggerates many things, brags too much about himself and ran up a huge deb. He does not pay his bills to cities that host his rallies, and I know there is a lot more.\n\nDo you want Kamala Harris to be president? She swears incessantly. Over the last four years she has done nothing to secure our borders. She gives migrants driver\u2019s licenses and the right to vote, endorses things the worst administration that we have ever had does.\n\nIs she going to give us four more years of free border crossings? She is part of the highest inflation we have had in a long time, part of price increases of consumer products condones her boss (President Biden) to run around the country campaigning for her in Taxpayer supported Air Force One when it should only be used for United States business. She is too much left to be any good for the country.\n\nEither one of these two are going to be bad for the country and when they are,\n\nI will be able to say that I did not vote for either one of them. I will be able to tell those that did that you made your bed and now you can lay in it.\n\nWhy did I say that your vote does not count? Because you do not decide who is to be president. A group called the Electoral College does and if they don\u2019t, the courts can decide.\n\nRemember what happened to Hillary Clinton and Al Gore and I think there was another one in the 1800s.\n\nGood luck you voters as you are going to need it badly but my conscience will be clear.\n\nBarry Keller is a Warren resident.",

Whether voting in person, early, or absentee, students are choosing the method that works best for them.\n\nIn a recent Student Life Instagram poll, 87% of the 456 respondents indicated they planned to vote in November.\n\nMiami is committed to ensuring that all eligible students have access to the tools they need to vote. Miami\u2019s Voting Navigator, developed by the Division of Student Life, helps students determine if they are eligible to vote, their options for how to vote, and what ID requirements are in place for in-person voting.\n\nTo help students cast their ballots early, the Center for Student Engagement, Activities, and Leadership (SEAL) is hosting a Democracy Bus on Friday, Nov. 1. The free bus will take students to the Butler County Board of Elections, allowing them to drop off Ohio absentee ballots or vote early in person. Additionally, students can stop by the Armstrong Student Center rooms 2012 and 2018 for free stamps, envelopes, and absentee ballot request forms.\n\n\"It can be confusing, navigating different state laws around elections and voting,\" said Jen O'Brien, director of communications for student life. \"We want students to understand their options for casting their vote and simplify the process as much as possible.\"\n\nBeyond helping students cast their ballot, Miami's student counseling service is offering Campus Care sessions throughout the fall semester to help students debrief their emotions about current events without the need for scheduling a therapy session. Campus Care is held twice per week; no appointment is necessary and there is no fee.\n\nVoting early in person: Taking advantage of flexibility\n\nSophie Kwiatkowski, an English Literature and Sustainability major from Mentor, OH, initially planned to vote absentee but decided instead to switch her voter registration to Butler County to experience voting in person.\n\nWhile Kwiatkowski has voted in previous elections, this will be her first presidential election. \u201cI wanted the in-person voting experience and didn\u2019t want the hassle of mailing in an absentee request and ballot,\u201d she said.\n\nKwiatkowski will have the option to join the Center for Student Engagement, Activities, and Leadership on Friday, Nov. 1 on the Democracy Bus. The free bus ride is scheduled to take students to the Butler County Board of Elections to vote early in person on the Friday before Election Day.\n\nVoting in person on Election Day: The full experience\n\nFor Mollie Duffy, senior Public Administration major from Buffalo Grove, IL, the in-person voting experience is a meaningful tradition.\n\nDuffy has been a dedicated voter since turning 18. She changed her address to Oxford during her sophomore year at Miami, and has been voting locally ever since. When Ohio\u2019s voter identification laws changed in 2023, she made the decision to vote absentee in Oxford. This year, however, she is excited to vote in her first presidential election in person on Election Day.\n\n\n\n\u201cI thought that it would be important to vote in-person,\u201d said Duffy, referring to her first presidential election. \u201cNot only for my own satisfaction, but also to have first-hand experience in a presidential polling place in order to keep my community informed on the conditions and expectations of voting in-person.\u201d\n\nVoting Absentee\n\nOut-of-State Absentee Voting\n\nJara Oden, fourth year Public Health and Gerontology double major from Charleston, WV, has been voting since 2020.\n\n\u201cI knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to go home [to West Virginia] for early in-person voting or voting on Election Day, so I decided to request an absentee ballot,\u201d she shared.\n\nThe November election will be Oden\u2019s second time voting in a presidential election. \u201cVoting is the most power we have as American citizens,\u201d she said. \u201cIt allows our voices to be heard and influence policy changes that we want to see made in our systems.\u201d\n\nIn-State Absentee Voting\n\nJulia Moore, a senior Creative Writing major from North Lawrence, OH, has also chosen to vote absentee, but her motivation is rooted in local issues back home.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m voting absentee for issues in my hometown because I think there are lots of changes worth making,\u201d Moore explained. She is particularly interested in educational funding, having felt the effects of underfunding during her own high school experience.\n\nMoore obtained her Ohio absentee ballot request form from the SEAL Ambassadors for Civic Engagement. \u201c[They] provide lots of resources for voter registration, information about deadlines and registration requirements,\u201d she added.\n\nElection Day Resources\n\nAs has been tradition the past several years, there will be a party at the polls event hosted near the on-campus polling location at the Marcum Hotel and Conference Center. If students have questions about voting before Election Day, they can reach out to the Division of Student Life at StudentLife@MiamiOH.edu or on Instagram @MiamiOH_StudentLife.",

        "text": "Thousands of migrants leave southern Mexico for the U.S. weeks ahead of presidential election\nA group of about 2,000 migrants left Mexico's southern border Sunday hoping to reach the country's north and ultimately the United States. The development comes weeks before the U.S. presidential election, in which immigration has been a key issue.\n\nSome migrants, like Venezuelan Joel Zambrano, believe a new administration in the U.S. could put an end to asylum appointments through an online system called CBP One.\n\n\"That is what makes us fearful. They say this could change because they could both close the CBP One appointment and all the services that are helping migrants,\" he said.\n\nBoth the lack of jobs in Mexico's south due to a new wave of incoming foreigners and a delay in asylum appointments in the U.S. have motivated more groups of migrants to leave the region in the past month.\n\n\"The situation in my country is very bad, the president doesn't do anything for us. We spent a week by the border, but getting documents takes time,\" said Honduran Roberto Dom\u00ednguez, 48. \"The documents we get are only for us to be in Tapachula and we cannot leave the city.\"\n\nThe group leaving Sunday was the third and the largest since the beginning of the administration of new Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who so far has made no changes in immigration policies established by her predecessor, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador.\n\nGroups of 800 and 600 migrants left the region earlier in October.\n\nActivist Luis Garc\u00eda Villagr\u00e1n estimates about 40,000 migrants are currently stranded in southern Mexico.\n\nLast month, the Biden administration announced new regulations to cement the partial asylum ban it enacted in June at the southern U.S. border, in a move that will likely extend the strict immigration policy indefinitely, CBS News' Camilo Montoya-Galvez reported. Administration officials have cited the asylum restrictions as the primary reason for the drop in illegal crossings by migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border this year.\n\nMany migrants who came to the U.S. through a sponsorship program designed to reduce illegal border crossings in recent years are set to lose their legal statuses by the end of October, since the Biden administration decided not to extend their coverage.\n\nUnder the program, about 214,000 Haitians, 117,000 Venezuelans, 111,000 Cubans and 96,000 Nicaraguans have so far come to the U.S. to live and work legally for two years, per an immigration law known as parole. The first group set to begin losing their parole status this month are Venezuelans, who started arriving in the U.S. through the program in October 2022.",

        "text": "Canadians and Mexicans nervously watch the US election\nNerves frayed in Canada and Mexico over US trade relations\n\nGetty Images The Peace Bridge between Port Erie, Ontario, and Buffalo, New York, carries more than one million trucks, and more than five million cars, every year\n\nAs Americans prepare to vote for their next president, Canadians and Mexicans are watching on nervously. For some Canadians living next to the US border, politics isn\u2019t a topic often discussed. \u201cYou don't talk politics and you don't talk religion,\u201d says 85-year-old Ernie, who lives in the Canadian town of Fort Erie, just across the Niagara River from Buffalo, New York. Yet for others in Fort Erie, Ontario, politics can come up, especially after a few beers, and with a US presidential election fast approaching. A short walk from the Peace Bridge that connects the two countries is Southsides Patio Bar & Grill, where US-born bartender Lauren says she frequently has to break up political arguments. \u201cIt happens, especially after a few drinks. Everybody's voice is heard here,\u201d she laughs while shaking her head.\n\nSome 2,000 miles (3,200 km) southwest in the Mexican border city of Juarez, Sofia Ana is in the Monday morning queue of cars waiting to cross to El Paso, Texas for work. \"There's better employment opportunities in the US, there's better benefits,\u201d she explains. Ana is one of an estimated 500,000 Mexicans who legally cross the border into the US every week day. It is in their interest that relations between the two countries remain cordial. \u201cIt affects us deeply\u2026 it is very intense,\u201d adds Ana from her car window. With more than 155 million Americans due to vote in the US presidential election on 5 November, it is fair to say that the outcome will be felt well beyond the US. No more so than its largest trading partners Canada and Mexico. The two-way trade of goods between the US and Mexico totalled $807bn (\u00a3621bn) last year, making Mexico the US\u2019s biggest trading partner when it comes to physical items. Meanwhile, the US\u2019s goods trade with Canada in 2023 was in second place on $782bn. By comparison the figure for the US and China was $576bn.\n\nGetty Images More than half a million Mexicans legally travel into the US every day, mostly by car\n\nMexico and Canada\u2019s future trade with the US could be impacted if Donald Trump wins the US election. This is because he is proposing to introduce substantial import tariffs. These would be 60% for goods from China, and 20% on products from all other countries, apparently including Mexico and Canada. By contrast, Kamala Harris is widely expected to maintain the current more open trade policies of President Biden. This is despite the fact she voted against the 2020 United States Mexico Canada Agreement (USMCA) free trade deal, saying it didn\u2019t go far enough on tackling climate change. Trump and Harris have \u201cstarkly different visions for the future of US economic relations with the world\u201d, said one study in September. Back in Juarez, shop owner Adrian Ramos says that US political instability is something business owners like himself have had to get used to. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen it all,\u201d he says. Mr Ramos adds that the result in the US on 5 November will likely impact on his business whoever wins. \u201cIf Trump wins, it's going to take longer to cross over to the States, if Harris wins, it may not, but there will be changes depending on who wins.\u201d\n\nMexican shop owner Adrian Ramos says that Mexicans will be affected by the US election result no matter who wins\n\nIn the rural Canadian township of Puslinch, Ontario, beef farmer Dave Braden is definitely more concerned about Trump returning to the White House. \u201cThe worry with Trump is that he'll introduce a policy [such as tariffs], and just say \u2018get on with it\u2019 and that is threatening,\u201d says Mr Braden, standing between hay bales in front of one of his cattle fields. \u201cI think with Harris, we have the assumption that she will recognize the relationship between the two countries and we will work together.\u201d The Canadian Chamber of Commerce is also concerned about the possibility of a second Trump presidency introducing new tariffs. It calculated that tariffs of 10% on Canadian imports (a level that Trump has previously suggested), would cost each Canadian and American $CA1,100 ($800; \u00a3615) per year. The Canadian government has reportedly been talking to Trump\u2019s camp to try to exempt Canada in the event that he does win the election.\n\nNot every Canadian has such fears about Trump though. One Ontario farmer who is supporting him didn\u2019t want to speak on the record, but says he believes the former president is stronger on the economy, which would benefit Canada. For Georganne Burke, the Republicans Overseas chapter leader for Canada, it\u2019s no surprise that some Trump supporters don\u2019t speak publicly about him. She says that backing Trump is \u201cnot a popular position to be in\u201d. Recent polling suggests that Harris is significantly more popular than Trump among Canadians. The USMCA, which was negotiated in 2018 under Trump\u2019s presidency, is up for renegotiation in 2026. With that on his mind, Canada\u2019s Minister for Innovation, Science and Industry Francois Champagne tells the BBC he is checking the US election polls daily. \u201cBecause this is such a valued relationship. It\u2019s why I call it this indispensable relationship, because when you look at everything, you realise how indispensable we are to each other,\u201d he explains. In the run up to the election Mr Champagne is spending time meeting American counterparts of both parties. In his words \u201cconnecting the dots\u201d. \u201cFor example, when I meet the governor of South Carolina, which has a plant in the auto sector, I remind him that a lot of the critical minerals are coming from Canada,\u201d he says. \u201cSo, it's making sure that everyone understands that we are joint at the hip in terms of security, supply chain, but also a growth agenda for North America.\u201d\n\nBeef farmer Dave Braden\n\nLila Abed, an expert on US-Mexico relations, says that whatever November\u2019s outcome, \u201cthere will be three essential topics on the bilateral agenda with Mexico that are going to have to be dealt with immediately\u201d \u2013 migration, security and trade. \u201cIt is telling that [new Mexican president] Claudia Sheinbaum hasn't designated Mexico's ambassador to the US,\u201d adds Ms Abed, who is director of the Mexico Institute at the Washington-based Wilson Centre think tank. \u201cI don't believe that will be announced until after the US presidential election, because she wants to take into consideration what kind of individual she wants in Washington after the result.\u201d Looking ahead to 2026, Ms Abed believes the USMCA renegotiation will focus on US efforts to stop increased Chinese investment in Mexico. \"Where Republicans and Democrats actually coincide is on trying to stem or trying to stop Chinese investment in Mexico, which is something that both political parties in the United States are very concerned about,\u201d she says. \u201cWhile I believe that, you know, the tone and the policies will naturally differ depending on who wins the White House, I do believe that the main issues on the bilateral agenda will remain.\u201d Additional reporting by Vianey Alderete.",

        "text": "What Happens If an Indicted Candidate Wins the Presidency?\nClaire Finkelstein\n\nA paper co-authored by Prof. Claire Finkelstein explores three questions that require urgent examination both prior to and immediately after the 2024 presidential election.\n\nClaire Finkelstein, Algernon Biddle Professor of Law and Professor of Philosophy, has co-authored a new paper that explores what would happen to pending trials if Donald Trump wins the 2024 presidential election.\n\n\u201cWhen an Indicted Candidate Wins the Presidency: What Happens to the Trials If Donald Trump Wins the Election?,\u201d recently published in the Southern California Law Review, is co-authored by Richard Painter, University of Minnesota Law School Professor and former Associate Counsel to the President and chief White House ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush.\n\nThe authors explore the unprecedented circumstances surrounding this presidential election and the series of urgent legal questions that will be raised if Trump wins.\n\n\u201cFor the first time in U.S. history, one of the two leading candidates for President is a convicted felon and is in the middle of multiple criminal trials on other charges in both state and federal courts,\u201d explained Finkelstein. \u201cOur paper considers constitutional history, caselaw on presidential immunity\u2014including the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in Trump v. United States\u2014and the implications for the rule of law, and hence for the longevity of U.S. democracy, if a sitting President is effectively above the law.\u201d\n\nThe paper examines three questions that the authors argue require urgent examination both prior to and immediately after the 2024 presidential election:\n\n(1) Regarding the federal charges prosecuted by the Department of Justice (DOJ), does the DOJ\u2019s 50-year-old policy of never indicting a sitting President apply to a previously indicted individual who is elected President after indictment and is in the middle of ongoing criminal trials?\n\n(2) If the DOJ\u2019s policy does not block continuing with the prosecution, would the President\u2019s usual right of removal apply to allow him to fire Special Prosecutor Jack Smith or otherwise use the President\u2019s control of the DOJ to effectively end the two federal criminal cases against him?\n\n(3) Regarding state prosecutions, how protected would each of these state processes be in the face of claims of federal preemption and arguments of executive privilege, immunity, and authority?\n\nNotably, the authors argue that the DOJ policy of not indicting a sitting president does not apply to an already indicted individual who enters the presidency with trials already underway.\n\n\u201cWhen an individual is indicted before being nominated by his party to run for office\u2026there is considerably less worry that the prosecution was brought to harass or disable a political rival,\u201d the authors explain. \u201cThis is particularly the case if the indictment is handed down before the individual declares his candidacy, but it may be the case even thereafter,\u201d they write. This is among the reasons the authors see the case of a previously indicted individual as different from the case of a sitting president who is indicted.\n\nAs a general matter, the authors argue that the greater the power of the U.S. presidency, the more accountability is needed to hold that office in check. Yet, paradoxically, the greater the power, the more difficult accountability is to achieve. They argue that the challenge of prosecuting Donald Trump under the four indictments initially brought against him in state and federal courts clearly illustrates this dynamic. Yet, they explain it is the power of the U.S. presidency that has enabled a former president who stands accused of committing serious crimes to control the very process by which he is to be judged and potentially held responsible and punished for violating the law.\n\n\u201cPresidential power, in short, both enabled President Trump to violate the law while he was in office and now gives him hope of avoiding accountability after he is no longer President, at a time when he is once more seeking the office,\u201d said Finkelstein.\n\nFinkelstein and Painter recognize that it is now obvious, based on Trump\u2019s own remarks, recent reporting containing important revelations about his attempted use of the DOJ during his first term in office, and Project 2025, that he will attempt to weaponize the DOJ not only to halt the trials in their tracks, but to punish anyone who attempted to hold him accountable for his alleged crimes.\n\n\u201cBut the fact that he will attempt to bend DOJ processes to his own purposes does not mean that this reflects the law,\u201d said Finkelstein. \u201cThe principle that an individual who has potentially committed a crime should be immunized against all accountability for that crime simply by declaring himself a candidate for high office is unacceptably deferential to the role of political candidates in a democracy,\u201d the authors argue.\n\n\u201cThe United States is now in unknown territory,\u201d said Painter. \u201cThe country has never had a president sentenced to prison either before, during, or after his presidency. If there is any hope of restoring the rule of law after a Trump presidency, and some small hope of forestalling some of the worst excesses of abuse of presidential authority during a second Trump administration, it is critical to analyze clearly the actual legal status of the trials post-election and, at the very least, to establish a correct standard to which the DOJ and state prosecutors should conform.\u201d\n\nRead Finkelstein and Painter\u2019s full paper.",

        "text": "Health and the 2024 US Election\nThe outcome of the 2024 US election will undoubtedly affect patient and community health, along with the health care delivery system, in a multitude of ways. In response to a call for articles on August 18, 2023, by the JAMA Network, articles have been published in JAMA and multiple JAMA Network journals addressing many of the health and health care issues at stake in the election.1 As the November 5, 2024, election date draws near, this Editorial provides a summary of key aspects of the JAMA publications. In their Editorial, Galbraith and Carroll summarized new research published in JAMA Pediatrics on how children are affected by the issues to be addressed in this election.2 The JAMA Network has also published a website page collecting all of these articles to facilitate access for readers.\n\nAs a starting point, 4 central health-related issues that will likely be key for voters in the coming election were highlighted by Parekh3: prescription drug costs, women\u2019s health and reproductive health, COVID-19 and other public health policies, and the opioid overdose epidemic and its implications for border policies. These and other important health issues, including firearm safety and the nation\u2019s mental health crisis, have been discussed by the many authors who responded to the JAMA call for articles.\n\nAs was discussed by Huberfeld and colleagues4 in their Viewpoint, the proposed federal health care policies of the 2 major political parties appear to rest on fundamentally different foundations. The authors noted that the Democratic Party platform includes dozens of pages of health reform proposals, whereas the Republican Party platform includes a few sentences on health care\u2013related issues.\n\nThe expertise and lived experience of physicians and other health care professionals providing evidence-based care is a strong foundation for shaping health policies at multiple levels. Behrens and colleagues5 emphasized the importance of health professional engagement, suggesting that the national election may cause individuals to overlook local politics that affect firearm safety, food and housing assistance, and other health-related policies, illustrating the importance of voting for every election listed on the ballot, from the most local school board election to those for state and federal government. An example of health professional leadership was outlined by Yang and colleagues,6 in which they described the need to facilitate structural change using an enhanced understanding of immigrants who have experienced scapegoating that the authors call \u201cmigration stigma.\u201d However, Zhong and colleagues7 reported that physicians were no more likely than nonphysicians to participate in political activities, based on results from 2017 to 2021 survey data.\n\nSeismic legal challenges have affected reproductive health care since the Dobbs v Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization decision by the Supreme Court, which held that the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion. Evidence clearly documents that restrictive state-level laws interfere with clinicians\u2019 ability to provide the full spectrum of reproductive health care to patients and disproportionately worsen existing disparities in care and outcomes.8 Goodwin and colleagues9 described how the deprivation of abortion care, an essential part of reproductive care, is a gross violation of medical ethics. The authors also explained how federal and state laws pose risks to patients, affecting current health and future fertility. There has been no shortage of public information about the legal risks that clinicians face when providing evidence-based care for individuals with miscarriages or complications during pregnancy. Although the vague exception language used by many states superficially defers to clinician expertise, Shachar and colleagues10 articulated the legal risks clinicians face if they follow the standard of care and act according to their training and ethics. Interpretation of legislative language to impose rigid clinical categories of \u201clife-threatening,\u201d \u201cserious risk of substantial impairment,\u201d and other terms simply does not capture the clinical complexity of pregnancy, pregnancy complications, or future fertility. Individuals who need an abortion to avoid serious health consequences remain vulnerable, as Cohen and colleagues11 described in their Viewpoint on the US Supreme Court Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act decision.\n\nLanguage clearly matters.12 Clinicians are well aware that early pregnancy loss of naturally conceived embryos is common, with as many as two-thirds of fertilized eggs dying spontaneously. This outcome can be heart breaking for individuals with hopes to start or expand their family. The push for \u201cpersonhood\u201d language was central to the Alabama Supreme Court\u2019s 2024 decision related to \u201cwrongful death\u201d of laboratory-conceived embryos. The immediate effect, and cessation of in vitro fertilization care, was devastating for individuals seeking assisted reproduction care; some of these individuals lost the only opportunity they had to conceive using their own embryo(s). At the heart of this issue is the fundamental freedom to protect one\u2019s fertilized eggs without legal interference that prohibits transfer across state lines.12\n\nCosts of medical care and drugs, as well as the cost of health insurance, are of great concern to voters older than 50 years, as reported by Ayanian and colleagues.13 Affordable health care access varies across the US partly because of state decisions to expand Medicaid.14 Similarly, despite promises that Medicare Advantage plans make health care services more affordable, evidence suggests that these plans are no less costly than traditional Medicare coverage, raising the need for increased scrutiny, given their greater associated expense.15 Amba and colleagues16 also described how major political party plans to ensure Medicaid sustainability and sufficiency differ starkly, with Democrats favoring expansion and Republicans pushing for limits. Other government policies targeting costs have been effective, such as the substantial increase in shingles vaccination observed after implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act policy that eliminated certain out-of-pocket costs.17 Moreover, provisions within the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act appear to have stimulated innovation and competition in the breast pump market.18 Such policy changes are occurring contemporaneously with significant market consolidations, including among pharmacy benefit managers.19\n\nUS presidential candidates have expressed their intention to address the high costs of prescription medications. Government actions, including curtailing patent thickets and exercising previously unused federal march-in rights on patents on drugs created using taxpayer funds, may be effective strategies to lower drug prices.20 However, the authority of federal agencies responsible for various aspects of health is being challenged, most notably with the overturning of Chevron deference by the Supreme Court that may undermine the ongoing administrative work of regulatory agencies, including federal agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Shachar and Kaplan21 described the additional risks for well-established preventive care coverage through interference with the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, and the Health Resources and Services Administration. Robertson and colleagues22 outlined the specific risks for implementation of USPSTF recommendations for clinical preventive services.\n\nThe 2024 US elections have the potential to meaningfully affect existing and persistent health disparities. Government policies that may seem tangential to health may have significant influence, including addressing the digital divide that reduces the ability of marginalized communities to access telehealth or online health services.23 The existing disadvantages of limited or nonexistent digital access were evident during COVID-19 vaccine distribution, which relied on online registration and appointment scheduling. The opioid overdose crisis affects all communities, with even elected officials experiencing loss of loved ones. Efforts to decriminalize illicit substances and expand harm-reduction models, including overdose prevention sites, are being evaluated.24 The outcome of the election is likely to affect the implementation of a successful drug control policy. As the major political parties consider various forms of criminal justice reform, attention is needed to address current health care and medical needs in the carceral setting. Haber and colleagues25 explained the implications of the First Step Act, which improved protections, including health care protection, for these medically vulnerable individuals. The outcome of the election will affect the further implementation of the First Step Act.\n\nThe 2024 US elections have the potential to affect many other aspects of health care. Health care professionals have demonstrated their commitment to public health and care of individual patients, most recently through heroic efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic. Various laws and policies that promote health or address interference between clinicians and patients are contemporary issues in this election. The voice and expertise of clinicians is central to safeguarding health and health care in the US and worldwide. Our purpose in highlighting the numerous articles published by JAMA and within the JAMA Network addressing key issues at play in the upcoming election is not to take a position, but to underscore the high stakes for health and health care in the election and the importance of casting your vote.\n\nBack to top Article Information\n\nCorresponding Author: Linda Brubaker, MD, JAMA (linda.brubaker@jamanetwork.org).\n\nPublished Online: October 21, 2024. doi:10.1001/jama.2024.21511\n\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr Brubaker reported receiving an editorial stipend from UpToDate outside the submitted work.

        "text": "University of Florida\nDays before the 2000 presidential election, NBC News political reporter Tim Russert was asked on air about the key to winning the election. He wrote his response on a whiteboard. \u201cFLORIDA FLORIDA FLORIDA!\u201d From 1876 to the infamous 2000 election and beyond, Russert\u2019s words ring true.\n\nInspired by Russert\u2019s words and this year\u2019s upcoming election, the Libraries\u2019 exhibition analyzes key points in election history with uniquely Florida ties. This includes parallels between the 1876 election and 2000, UF President Albert Murphree\u2019s potential nomination in 1924, Floridians who have run for president, and the Florida election battle between George W. Bush and Al Gore. Exhibition highlights include presidential memorabilia, elector tickets, correspondence, and a 2000 Pasco County Hole Bunch Ballot.\n\nFlorida! Florida! Florida! Presidential Elections and the Sunshine State was curated by Boyd Murphree (Political Papers Archivist, Smathers Libraries) and designed by Katiana Bagu\u00e9 (Exhibits Associate, Smathers Libraries) and Lourdes Santamar\u00eda-Wheeler (Exhibits Director, Smathers Libraries). The exhibit is on view in the Smathers Library Gallery September 9, 2024 \u2013 December 16, 2024. Items on view are from the George A. Smathers Libraries Special and Area Studies Collections, including the P.K. Yonge Library of Florida History, University Archives, George A. Smathers Papers, Bill Nelson Political Papers, and the Jim Liversidge Collection.\n\nThe Smathers Library Gallery is located on the second floor of the Smathers Library on the University of Florida campus. Hours are Monday through Friday 9:00 a.m. \u2013 5:00 p.m., unless otherwise specified and with occasional exceptions for maintenance. All exhibitions are open to the public and free of charge.\n\nA complimentary display of additional political memorabilia and ephemera will be on view in the Smathers Library lobby October 28, 2024 \u2013 December 16, 2024. An online exhibition will also launch later this fall. For more information see https://exhibitions.uflib.ufl.edu/",

That makes sense given the nature of the campaign's central messages and appeals.\u201d\n\nIn another Newsweek article, \u201cDonald Trump Is More Popular With Men Than Ever Before,\u201d Reeher explains, \u201cNot much about Trump has changed, so any differences may have more to do with Harris' campaign. Harris and the Democratic campaign have really emphasized the identity aspect of the Democratic Party's messaging, and she's also emphasized her gender in her appeals.\u201d\n\nIn The Mirror article, \u201c\u2018Unhinged\u2019 Donald Trump rants show he\u2019s transforming US into \u2018presidential dictatorship\u2019 warns expert,\u201d Reeher says, \u201cTrump has always relied on earned media for a lot of his exposure, and this might be a somewhat calculated, though bizarre, way to try to keep the spotlight on him as the media has turned a lot of their attention to Harris.\u201d",

        "text": "US President Biden Awards National Humanities Medal to UH\u2019s Nicol\u00e1s Kanellos\nFor more than four decades, the University of Houston\u2019s Nicol\u00e1s Kanellos has played a major role in helping Latinos tell their stories. Whether it\u2019s through fiction, poetry, biographies or history, Kanellos has made an indelible impact on U.S. Latino culture.\n\nHe has balanced his roles directing Arte P\u00fablico Press and the Recovering the U.S. Hispanic Literary Heritage initiative with a full-time faculty role at UH. Today, he was honored for his hard work with a National Humanities Medal presented by U.S. President Joe Biden.\n\nKanellos, Brown Foundation Professor of Hispanic Studies, received the medal during a White House ceremony in Washington, D.C. on Oct. 21. Kanellos was among 17 artists, authors, musicians, historians and other professionals honored by President Biden at this event. Others in attendance included National Arts Medalists, who were also recognized by President Biden.\n\n\u201cThe medal has my name on it\u2014and I am so proud of that\u2014but in reality, it honors all the mission-driven people who for some 40 years have searched for and preserved Latino cultural history and made it accessible to schools, universities, libraries and the public at-large,\u201d Kanellos said. \u201cHere at UH, the entire Arte P\u00fablico Press team of professionals and students assiduously works to create new humanistic knowledge through cutting-edge technology, traditional scholarship and outreach to the community.\u201d\n\nKanellos\u2019 long history with Arte P\u00fablico Press and the University of Houston has yielded many published works across genres. Likewise, his oversight of Recovering the U.S. Hispanic Literary Heritage has led to the preservation of newspapers and publications documenting Hispanic history. In both endeavors, he also has provided invaluable experience to students who assist with research and other scholarly tasks.\n\n\u201cWords can shape our world, tell our stories and shine a light on the unseen,\u201d said UH President Renu Khator. \u201cFor more than 40 years, Nicol\u00e1s Kanellos has used the power of the written word to uplift, celebrate and commemorate Hispanic American culture. I am beyond proud to see his immeasurable contributions awarded with such a distinguished honor.\u201d\n\nAlthough he received news of this honor in recent weeks, Kanellos\u2019 journey to the White House has decades in the making.\n\nThe seeds for Arte P\u00fablico Press were planted in 1972 when Kanellos and collaborator Luis Davila founded literary magazine Revista Chicano-Rique\u00f1a. The publication served as a platform for unsung Latino authors and showcased their works in both English and Spanish. Interest in the publication increased over the years and Kanellos was inspired to launch a publishing house. By 1979, Arte P\u00fablico was in full bloom and found a permanent home at UH.\n\nNotable authors such as Sandra Cisneros, Victor Villase\u00f1or, Helena Maria Viramontes and others published works through Arte P\u00fablico. Works from rising stars like Daniel Pe\u00f1a have also found a home at Arte P\u00fablico.\n\nA 2022 UH article details the history of Arte P\u00fablico Press. Additional information on the publishing house and the Recovering the U.S. Hispanic Literary Heritage project are available online.\n\nThe National Humanities Medal has recognized both individuals and groups who have made significant contributions to the humanities\u2014history, literature, music, philosophy and other disciplines. This annual award has been presented annually by the National Endowment for the Humanities since 1997.",

        "text": "Who do Britons want to win the 2024 US presidential election?\nTwo-thirds of the British public back Harris, with only one in six hoping for a second Trump term In just over a fortnight, polls will close across the United States and the winner of the 2024 presidential election will be revealed, with either Democratic candidate Kamala Harris becoming the first woman president or Republican Donald Trump returning to power after four years out of office. It has been a tightly fought contest, with YouGov\u2019s MRP projection showing \u2018tossups\u2019 in key swing states, meaning both candidates still have all to play for in the final days of the campaign. While we in Britain obviously do not get a say in the election, that\u2019s not to say people aren\u2019t interested, with four in ten Britons (42%) saying they are paying at least a fair amount of attention to the current race for the White House. Part of this is driven by personal investment, with half of the public (49%) saying it matters to them who wins, but it is also likely spurred by a sense that the result won\u2019t just impact Americans, with three quarters of Britons (76%) saying it matters to the UK who ends up president.\n\nBritain\u2019s view on Harris vs Trump While the election might be a knife-edge contest across the pond, preferences here are far more one-sided. Almost two thirds of Britons (64%) want current vice president Kamala Harris to be the next president of the United States, against just one in six (18%) who are hoping for a second Trump term.\n\nHarris\u2019s 46-point lead over Trump represents a noticeable improvement over her predecessor Joe Biden. In May, when he was still the Democratic candidate, YouGov found that 55% of Britons wanted Biden to win the election, compared to 18% who favoured Trump. Britons\u2019 preference for Harris over Trump is clear across nearly all parts of the public, but is at its highest among Labour and Lib Dem voters, more than eight in ten of whom (83-86%) want Harris to become the first woman president. Conservatives are less overwhelming in their support for the Democratic candidate, but nearing six in ten (57%) still hope that Harris wins out in the end, more than double the quarter of Tories (25%) who want a Trump triumph in a fortnight. Such limited enthusiasm for Trump among Conservatives stands in contrast to leadership hopeful Robert Jenrick\u2019s endorsement of the Republican\u2019s run for office. Reform UK voters are the sole exception among the British public in wanting to see Trump return to the White House, with a small majority (54%) backing Trump and just a quarter (26%) favouring Harris. Even among wider Leave voters, Harris is preferred by 48% to 29%.\n\nAs in America, support for Donald Trump is higher among British men (24%) than women (12%). Nonetheless, these Trump-supporting men are still a minority, being clearly outnumbered by the six in ten British men (60%) who favour a Harris win. Contrary to the age variation between parties seen in British elections, support for Harris and Trump among Britons is relatively consistent across age groups, with those favouring a Harris victory only ranging from 61% among 25-49 year olds to 70% among 18-24 year olds. How do Britons see leading American politicians and parties? Such a \u2018landslide\u2019 against Donald Trump in the minds of Britons shouldn\u2019t be surprising. Only one in six Britons (18%) have a favourable opinion of the former president and just one in nine (11%) see the wider Republican party in a good light. This stands against more than three quarters (77%) who have a negative view of Trump, including two-thirds (66%) who say their opinion of him is \u2018very unfavourable\u2019. By contrast, 60% of Britons have a favourable opinion of Kamala Harris, with less than a quarter (23%) seeing her negatively at present. While attitudes to Joe Biden are less positive, with half of Britons (53%) having an unfavourable view of the president, against a third (35%) with a favourable opinion, this still leaves a higher proportion of the British public with a good opinion of Biden than with any UK politician.",

The survey was conducted by The Harris Poll on behalf of APA among more than 3,000 U.S. adults age 18+ between Aug. 1 and 23, 2024.\n\nCompared with the previous two U.S. presidential elections, stress related to the election was similar to 2020 (69% vs. 68%) but significantly higher than in 2016 (52%). What sets the 2024 poll apart from previous APA election surveys is the collective stress about the potential fallout from the election results: More than 7 in 10 adults (72%) said they are worried the election results could lead to violence, and more than half of adults (56%) said they believed the 2024 presidential election could be the end of democracy in the U.S. Meanwhile, around a third of adults (32%) said the political climate has caused strain among themselves and their family members, with (30%) who said they limit their time with family because they don\u2019t share the same values.\n\n\u201cFor nearly a decade, people have faced a political climate that is highly charged, which has led to the erosion of civil discourse and strained our relationships with our friends and our families. But isolating ourselves from our communities is a recipe for adding more stress to our lives,\u201d said APA CEO Arthur C. Evans Jr., PhD. \u201cWe must remember that the most extreme voices are often the loudest, and that the majority of adults share similar values and concerns.\u201d\n\nStress in America\u2122 2024: A Nation in Political Turmoil reveals a country where trust has been shaken in the government and in each other. Most adults (54%) reported they have very little to no trust in the U.S. government, and 41% of adults reported the state of the nation has made them consider moving to a different country. Half of adults (50%) said tension around social and political topics makes them less likely to want to connect with other people and around 3 in 10 (28%) said they have nothing in common with people who have different political opinions than they do. More than 2 in 5 adults (46%) wouldn\u2019t date someone who didn\u2019t share the same political opinions (47% of women said this, and 45% of men).\n\nYet the survey showed commonalities regardless of political party affiliation, with the future of the nation being the stressor that was most commonly rated as significant by Republicans (80%), Democrats (79%) and independents (73%). Further, Republicans, Democrats and independents agreed that the country\u2019s system of checks and balances isn\u2019t working (76% of Republicans, 71% of Democrats and 74% of independents). They also reported being stressed that politicians aren\u2019t talking about the things that are most important to them (62%, 58% and 60%, respectively), and that the political climate has caused strain between them and their family members (32%, 35% and 32%, respectively).\n\nMis- and disinformation have dialed up the volume on stress, as many adults (73%) reported it is stressful to know how real fake information can look or seem. A strong majority (82%) of U.S. adults were worried that people may be basing their values and opinions on false or inaccurate information.\n\nDespite the pervasive stress about the nation\u2019s future and the fear of violence, this year\u2019s survey showcased how participants are using the political climate as a springboard for activism and driving positive change. More than three-quarters of adults (77%) said they intend to vote in the presidential election, and half of adults (51%) said they feel more compelled to volunteer or support causes they value\u2014significantly higher than the 45% who said so in 2019 during the lead up to the 2020 presidential election. Diverse communities in particular are being moved to act; 73% of Black adults and 67% of Latino/a/e adults reported feeling that their vote matters.\n\nIn addition, 3 in 5 adults reported feeling hopeful about the change this election will bring (61%), and that this election will lead to a more inclusive society (59%). More than 2 in 5 adults (42%) said they haven\u2019t felt this excited about an election in years. Significantly, although Black and Latino/a/e groups and those who identify as LGBTQ reported personal safety as a major stressor (47%, 47% and 50%, respectively), they have remained optimistic; 64% of Black and Latino/a/e adults reported feeling hopeful that the election could mean a more inclusive future.\n\n\u201cStress surrounding the upcoming election seems overwhelming. But despite concerns about a nation divided across cultural identities and political parties, it\u2019s encouraging that hope could be the catalyst, where people can come together and have a stake in deciding their future,\u201d said Evans. \u201cWe see people\u2019s desire for positive change as an opportunity to channel our collective stress into meaningful conversations and actions that promote healing and understanding.\u201d\n\nFor more information on the survey findings and helpful resources on how to handle stress, visit the Stress in America webpage.\n\nMethodology\n\nThe 2024 Stress in America\u2122 survey was conducted online within the United States by The Harris Poll on behalf of the American Psychological Association between Aug. 1\u201323, 2024, among 3,305 adults ages 18+ who reside in the U.S. that serves as a nationally representative sample. In addition to the national sample, oversamples were collected to allow for subgroup analysis within race/ethnicity groups. Sample sizes across the national and oversamples are as follows: 801 Black, 855 Hispanic and 804 Asian. Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish. Throughout the report, mentions of political parties are defined by those who self-identify as registered voters of the Democratic, Republican, or independent party.

        "text": "Presidential Election Concessions: Global Trends and New Research Agendas\nIn a recent CDDRL seminar series talk, UVA Associate Professor of Politics Anne Meng shared her research on global patterns of presidential election concessions. Her study underscores the crucial yet often overlooked role of election concessions in democracies.\n\nMeng emphasized the vitality of concessions in facilitating peaceful transfers of power, an essential element for the functioning of democracy. When losing candidates concede defeat, they validate the election results and contribute to a smooth transition of power. Despite their significance, systematic data on post-election concessions worldwide has been limited. Meng\u2019s research seeks to fill this gap by presenting a comprehensive dataset tracking presidential election concessions from 1980 to 2020 across 107 countries.\n\nEncompassing both democratic and autocratic regimes, the dataset includes 638 election observations, wherein concessions are categorized into three distinct groups:\n\nStrong concessions (losing candidates explicitly admit defeat) Weak concessions (vague statements regarding defeat) No concession (candidates either refuse to concede or make no statement at all).\n\n\n\nMeng\u2019s analysis unveiled significant patterns in concession behavior across different political systems. In established democracies, losing candidates typically concede, while \u201cno concession\u201d outcomes are more prevalent in autocratic regimes. When incumbents lose, they are more likely to concede than opposition candidates who lose, a finding that may run contrary to perceptions of incumbents. However, incumbents are less likely to lose elections in the first place.\n\nMeng's study underscores the connection between election integrity and the likelihood of concessions. When the fairness of an election is in doubt, opposition candidates may justifiably withhold concessions to avoid legitimizing an unfair process. Furthermore, the study found that strong concessions correlate with fewer post-election protests and acts of violence, suggesting a potential link between concessions and the stability of power transitions. Meng cautioned, however, that the causal relationship remains unclear, indicating the need for further research to ascertain whether concessions directly reduce unrest or if other factors, such as election integrity, are at play.\n\nMeng identified several factors influencing whether a losing candidate concedes. Candidate characteristics significantly impact concession behavior; for instance, incumbents and successors tend to concede more often. In contrast, factors like gender and ideology do not significantly affect the likelihood of conceding. Additionally, the specifics of the election play a role: concessions are more likely when the victory margin falls between 5% and 10%. Overall, losing candidates in democracies are generally more willing to concede than those in autocratic systems. Notably, Meng's research suggests that past concessions do not guarantee future ones, revealing challenges in establishing consistent democratic norms.\n\nIn her conclusion, Meng emphasized that while election concessions generally reflect the health of democracy, their absence can mirror legitimate concerns about unfair elections. This complexity calls for a reevaluation of how we understand concessions, emphasizing the need to consider underlying narratives of election quality and integrity.",

        "text": "America Votes 2024, Part 2: Limits of Forecasting, Declining Trust, and Combating Polarization\nCan We Trust The Polls?\n\n\n\nBrandice Canes-Wrone, Professor of Political Science and Director of the Hoover Institution\u2019s Center for Revitalizing American Institutions, provided a succinct overview of different forecasting models, touching on their limitations and recent adaptations. Historically, models like that of economist Ray Fair have centered their election predictions on fundamentals like the economy. These models face two main limitations. First, they do not incorporate opinion polls on the candidates themselves. Second, even if voters care about economic performance, increasing partisanship has skewed subjective perceptions of the economy. Some forecasting models have responded by weighing partisanship more in their calculations, though these poll-reliant frameworks present their own limitations as well. Currently, even the most accurate models suggest this uniquely tight race remains too close to call.\n\nShifting to the two candidates themselves, Canes-Wrone points out that campaign messaging from both sides aligns with the expectations of most analysts. Reacting to high inflation rates, Donald Trump has centered his campaign on economic promises while Kamala Harris tries to \u201cturn the page\u201d to distance herself from President Joe Biden. Both their campaign strategies echo a historic shift from persuading swing voters to mobilizing their bases. Trump has taken a rather unconventional approach to the ever-important ground game, largely outsourcing mobilization to Super PACs. As Canes-Wrone argues, however, the factors determining presidential outcomes have changed far less than the rest of US politics in the last 50 years.",

        "text": "Space in the 2024 elections\nSpace policy in the next administration\n\nBoth former President Trump and Vice President Harris have demonstrated their enthusiasm for space exploration and acumen for advancing space policy when in positions of power. However, the space policy of a future Harris or second Trump Administration will depend on how space fits into their worldview. Based on what\u2019s been said on the campaign trail so far, we can glean the general direction of both candidates.\n\nDrawing on her record as Vice President and Chair of the National Space Council, Kamala Harris's space policy priorities in her administration would likely blend a continuation of existing initiatives with a renewed focus on championing action on climate change and workforce development. NASA\u2019s Science Mission Directorate, where many of these needs exist currently, is ripe with opportunities for a Harris Administration to champion additional investments in and focus on space science.\n\nProminence of the U.S. space program is also a clear driving motivator for the Vice President. In her acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in August, Vice President Harris stated that she \u201cwill make sure that we lead the world into the future on space and artificial intelligence. That America, not China, wins the competition for the 21st century and that we strengthen, not abdicate, our global leadership.\u201d This will likely mean that programs that center national posture, namely the Artemis program, will enjoy continued support in a Harris Administration.\n\nWant to learn more about the possible space priorities of a Harris Administration? check out this interview on Planetary Radio: Space Policy Edition with Lori Garver, former NASA Deputy Administrator and Democratic space policy expert.\n\nFor former President Trump, maintaining U.S. preeminence is a major component of his campaign rhetoric. To that end, a second Trump Administration would likely view space as a key arena for competition with China, and would therefore prioritize initiatives aimed at maintaining American dominance in the space domain. This could include bolstering programs that accelerate the development of commercial space capabilities, like Artemis and the Commercial Lunar Payload Services program. Mars Sample Return is an example of a program that offers an opportunity to leverage the burgeoning commercial space industry to accomplish something that no other nation has: returning scientifically significant samples from another planet.\n\n\u201cWe will lead the world in space,\u201d said former President Trump at a recent campaign stop in North Carolina. In touting his relationship with SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, who has endorsed the former president in his personal capacity, Trump also expressed a need to increase the cadence of Starship launches \u201cbecause we want to reach Mars before the end of my term.\u201d This implies that a policy of a second Trump Administration will be to expedite the development of NASA\u2019s Moon-to-Mars plan to build upon the Artemis program to send astronauts to Mars.\n\nCheck out the Space Policy Edition interview with Dr. Greg Autry to learn about the possible space policy of a second Trump Administration. Dr. Autry served as part of the NASA transition team for the first Trump Administration.\n\nSecond in command\n\nWhile the President sets the tone and direction, the Vice President, as Chair of the National Space Council, plays a central role in implementing an administration\u2019s space policy priorities. Both Governor Tim Walz and Senator J.D. Vance have publicly expressed their support for NASA and space exploration, but neither has the depth of space policy experience of the candidates at the top of their respective tickets.\n\nSenator Vance, representing the home of Glenn Research Facility, joined a congressional letter with fellow Ohio Senator, Sherrod Brown, urging the Biden Administration to provide additional funding for the Glenn Research Center and Neil Armstrong Test Facility in the FY 2024 budget request.",

        "text": "US Elections 2024: Latest News, Expert Analysis, and Live Updates\nWhat is the 'Samosa Caucus?' How has it changed after US election?\n\nWilliam Jefferson Clinton, the 42nd President of the United States was born on August 19, 1946, in Hope, Arkansas. Raised in a working-class family, Clinton was marked by ambition early in life, famously shaking hands with US President John F Kennedy as a teen during a trip to Washington, DC.His education path took him through Georgetown University, where he graduated in 1968, to Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar, and finally to Yale Law School, where he met Hillary Rodham, his future wife and political partner.Clinton began his political career as Arkansas Attorney General in 1976, and just two years later, at age 32, he became one of the youngest governors in the nation\u2019s history. After losing his re-election bid in 1980, he staged a comeback in 1982 and served as governor of Arkansas for another decade.In 1992, Clinton ran for the presidency, portraying himself as a \u201cNew Democrat\u201d who could combine liberal social policies with moderate economic approaches. Despite facing allegations of marital infidelity and questions about avoiding the Vietnam draft, his campaign gained momentum.\n\nBefore Donald Trump took office, George W Bush was the most divisive US president of the modern era. Bush was the centre of controversy before he was even sworn into office. The 2000 US election and the outcome \u2013 where the Supreme Court essentially handed Bush the presidency by stopping an ordered recount \u2013 set the stage for what was to come.The Bush years witnessed arguably the most consequential event of this century \u2013 the 9/11 attacks. The day the twin towers crumbled and the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan afterward had a major impact on both America and the world. Let\u2019s take a closer look at the 43rd President of the United States Bush was born on July 6, 1946 in New Haven Connecticut. His parents were George HW Bush and Barbara Bush. Dubya, as he would later be known, grew up in Texas. Bush went to the Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts.\n\nHope and change was Barack Obama\u2019s slogan when he ran for president. While the first Black US president indeed offered hope to millions including many minorities, during his two terms in office, the change part proved to be a little, okay a lot, more difficult.The 44th President of the United States had little experience on the national scene. Indeed, he was a virtual newcomer to the ways of Washington \u2013 a stranger in an even stranger land. While Obama ran on healing the divisions of the past, in retrospect, the first Black president in US history was always going to arouse the ire of the worst of the far-right. Barack Obama was born on August 4, 1961 in Hawaii. His parents were Ann Dunham, a white woman from Kansas, and Barack Obama Sr., a Black man from Kenya.\n\nAs 45th President of the United States, critics gave him the moniker of divider-in-chief. America has never had a president like Trump.Ever since he came down that golden escalator in June 2015 to announce his candidacy for president, US politics has been defined by Trump. No candidate has ever taken over a major political party so quickly \u2013 or quite so ruthlessly.It would be no stretch to say today that Trump is the Republican Party \u2013 and the Republican Party is Trump.Donald John Trump was born on June 14, 1946 to builder Fred Trump and Mary Anne Macleod Trump. Trump was, by all accounts, a difficult child \u201cHe was a pretty rough fellow when he was small,\u201d Fred Trump recalled. Those who have been excommunicated from the Trump family have painted them as a dysfunctional bunch.\n\nThe 46th President of the United States was born on November 20, 1942 in the town of Scranton. Biden grew up in Pennsylvania in a large Catholic family. He worked as a prosecutor before diving into politics. In 1972, he would become Senator from Pennsylvania \u2013 a post he would hold for nearly four decades.By now, he was married to Neilia Hunter \u2013 with whom he would have three children. But tragedy struck soon. Biden\u2019s wife and infant daughter were killed in an accident, while he and his sons survived. Biden briefly considered ending his political career but later changed his mind.Biden had a stellar career in the Senate \u2013 serving on multiple high-profile councils including as chair of the powerful Foreign Relations Committee. But he always had one eye set on the ultimate prize \u2013 the US presidency.\n\nKamala Harris ran for US president and lost. Where does she go from here?\n\nWho is Mike Waltz, Donald Trump's new NSA pick? What are his ties to India Caucus?\n\nDonald John Trump was born in Queens, New York, on June 14, 1946. His father, Fred Trump was a successful real estate developer. Trump was educated at the New York Military Academy and the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce at the University of Pennsylvania. In 1971, he took over his father\u2019s real estate company, renaming it the Trump Organization. The business soon became involved in variety of projects, including hotels, resorts, residential and commercial building, casinos, and golf courses.\n\nKamala D. Harris is the Vice President of the United States. She always fights for the people \u2013 from her barrier-breaking time as District Attorney of San Francisco and Attorney General of California, to proudly serving as a United States Senator and the Vice President. January 20, 2021, Kamala Harris was sworn in as Vice President \u2013 the first woman, the first Black American, and the first South Asian American to be elected to this position.\n\nThe US presidential race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris will be decided on November 5 when America votes. But the candidate who wins the most votes, doesn\u2019t necessarily guarantee a victory. That\u2019s\u2019 because of the electoral college. Here\u2019s how it works Read More\n\nThe US presidential election is a complex process involving more than just the popular vote. Voters choose 538 electors, who ultimately decide the next president through the Electoral College. While most states follow a winner-takes-all system, a few use proportional representation. Key swing states can sway results, and despite absentee and early voting, the official winner isn\u2019t declared until Congress certifies the electoral votes Read More\n\nA simple guide to the US presidential election to be held on 5 November 2024 Read More\n\nWho is Dr Mehmet Oz, Trump\u2019s pick to run Medicare, Medicaid? Why is he so controversial?\n\nUS Presidential Elections 2024\n\nThe US presidential election on November 5, 2024, will be a significant moment for America, featuring former President Donald Trump as the Republican nominee and Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee, following President Joe Biden's decision not to seek a second term. The stakes are high as the nation faces economic recovery, social division and global uncertainties.\n\nKey dates to watch\n\nUS election 2024 date: November 5, 2024\n\nDebates: On 10 September 2024, Trump and Harris clashed intensely over key issues like inflation, abortion, immigration and foreign policy during the high-stakes ABC News presidential debate. With just eight weeks remaining until Election Day, both candidates made their case to win over voters.\n\nEarly voting in US election: Early voting for the US presidential election is underway in several states, allowing voters to cast ballots in person or by mail. States are sharing insights on early voting trends, including party affiliation and voter age. Harris' campaign is urging Democrats to embrace early voting, while despite his criticisms, Trump and the Republican Party are also encouraging their supporters to participate.\n\nAs the 2024 US presidential election race tightens, polls are becoming a crucial focus for both campaigns. With three weeks remaining, The New York Times\u2019 polling average shows Harris and Trump nearly tied in seven key battleground states, a rare occurrence this late in the election cycle. According to the BBC, Harris has held a slight lead in national polling averages since entering the race in late July. However, national polls may not always reliably predict the final election outcome.\n\nKey swing states to watch in the US presidential election\n\nA swing state is traditionally defined as one that significantly influences the outcome of US presidential elections, where Democratic and Republican candidates have nearly equal support. In the 2024 US election, key swing states will again be crucial in determining the next president. Georgia, Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada, North Carolina and Pennsylvania are among the battlegrounds showing a tight race between Trump and Harris. Winning these states is essential for either candidate to reach the 270 electoral votes needed for victory.\n\nAccording to US News, Arizona's political landscape shifted dramatically from a Trump win in 2016 to a narrow Biden victory in 2020, breaking a Republican hold on the state since the start of the 21st century. Biden's win in Georgia was historic, marking the first Democratic victory there since Bill Clinton in 1992. Michigan, while generally leaning Democratic, remains highly contested. Despite having the fewest electoral votes among swing states, Nevada is crucial for the presidential outcome. North Carolina, traditionally Republican-leaning, is still a key battleground, while Pennsylvania, despite its Republican leanings, sees fierce competition from both parties. Wisconsin, once a solidly Democratic \"blue wall\" state in the Rust Belt, became a battleground after Trump\u2019s narrow win in 2016.\n\nMain campaign issues\n\nThe 2024 US presidential election is shaping up as a clash of contrasting visions for America, with Trump and Harris focussing on different priorities to engage their core supporters and undecided voters.\n\nEconomy: Trump promises to restore economic growth, cut taxes and reduce inflation, while Harris advocates for a more inclusive economy that emphasises healthcare access, wage equality and infrastructure investments.\n\nImmigration and crime: Trump promotes stricter immigration policies and law enforcement to appeal to conservatives whereas Harris seeks comprehensive immigration reform that balances border security with pathways to citizenship.\n\nSocial issues: On topics like abortion rights, gun control and voting rights, the candidates are vastly different. Harris supports progressive policies, while Trump adheres to traditional conservative values.\n\nThe Electoral College\n\nIn US presidential elections, the Electoral College determines the winner, not the national popular vote. This system assigns electoral votes to the 50 states and the District of Columbia based on population. When voters cast their ballots, they are actually selecting a slate of electors for the president. Most states use a winner-takes-all approach, where the candidate winning the popular vote in that state receives all its electoral votes, except for Maine and Nebraska, which distribute theirs proportionally.\n\nA candidate must secure a minimum of 270 electoral votes out of a total of 538 to win the presidency. If the result is a 269-269 tie, the decision goes to the House of Representatives, where each state delegation casts one vote to break the deadlock.\n\nNotably, it is possible for a candidate to win the presidency without winning the popular vote, as seen with George W Bush in 2000 and Trump in 2016. This phenomenon also occurred three times in the 19th century.\n\nAfter the election, the electors formally cast their votes on December 17 and the results are sent to Congress, where they are officially counted on January 6. The candidate who secures 270 electoral votes or more is inaugurated as president on January 20.\n\nFundraising and campaign\n\nVice President Harris has raised over $1 billion in campaign funds since becoming the Democratic presidential nominee in July, according to US media reports. Although her campaign has not confirmed the exact amount, sources cited by The New York Times and NBC News indicate she has surpassed this milestone, including contributions to her campaign and Democratic Party committees.\n\nThis impressive fundraising gives Harris a significant financial advantage over her Republican rival, Trump, as they compete in a tightly contested race. In August, Trump and the Republican National Committee raised $130 million, leaving them with $295 million in cash reserves, compared to Harris and the Democrats' $404 million.\n\nAdditionally, The New York Times reports that Harris raised $72 million from three late-September events, positioning her to surpass Trump's September fundraising total of $160 million. Meanwhile, Republicans are closing the gap through super PACs, which can raise unlimited funds independently of campaigns. According to OpenSecrets, the largest pro-Trump super PAC has outspent its Harris-supporting counterpart by tens of millions in the 2024 race.\n\nOne of the defining features of the 2024 US presidential election will be voter turnout, especially in states with a high proportion of minorities, young voters and women. Harris is relying on these demographics to push her over the finish line. Conversely, Trump is counting on strong support from working-class voters and traditional Republicans, especially in rural areas, to mount a comeback.\n\nMail-in voting is anticipated to see robust participation this year, as several states are enhancing accessibility to their voting laws. Former President Trump, who previously opposed this method, seems to have shifted his stance with the introduction of his campaign's grassroots initiative, \u201cSwamp the Vote USA.\u201d\n\nThe 2024 US Presidential Election will significantly influence global geopolitics, particularly regarding relations with major powers like China, Russia and the European Union. Trump has pledged a return to his America First policies, focussing on trade protectionism and US sovereignty. In contrast, Harris is expected to adopt a more multilateral approach, collaborating with allies on climate change, international trade and global security issues.\n\nFinal thoughts on 2024 US Presidential Elections\n\nThe 2024 US election is set to be one of the most closely monitored in recent years, with Trump and Harris presenting contrasting visions for the country's future amid a deeply divided electorate. As the election date approaches, the race is expected to tighten, with both campaigns targeting undecided voters in key swing states.",

        "text": "Heller Hosts a Panel Discussion on the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election\nOn Wednesday, October 9, the Heller School hosted a panel discussion about the upcoming U.S. Presidential election featuring four scholars within the Brandeis community. Speakers included Faith Smith, ChaeRan Freeze, Anita Hill, and Harleen Singh. The event was cosponsored by the Department of African and African American Studies, the Department of Women\u2019s, Gender and Sexuality Studies, and the Women\u2019s Studies Research Center at Brandeis.\n\n\u201cToday we have the extraordinary opportunity to continue in that wonderful tradition established by Brandeis 75 years ago, and Heller 65 years ago, which is to be in community to debate topics that are essential to our life course, and the life course of those whom we champion through our social justice work at Brandeis and Heller,\u201d said moderator Maria Madison, Interim Dean of Heller, in introducing the event. After Dean Madison\u2019s opening remarks, each panelist had the opportunity to share their thoughts on the 2024 election and the social identities of both candidates through the lenses of race, diaspora/immigration, gender, and socioeconomic class.\n\nProfessor Faith Smith, Department Chair of the African and African American Studies department and Professor of English, Women\u2019s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies; Latin American, Caribbean, and Latinx Studies; and the CAST minor, spoke first about migrants and how they are perceived and often placed at a disadvantage both politically and socially. \u201cIt is important to think about the ways in which political candidates have attempted to malign a specific community and national origin,\u201d said Smith, noting the proliferation of media that can amplify misinformation. \u201cAs political actors, we have to listen carefully. As neighbors, we have to question why and when we feel prosperous or safe, or neither of those things, and at whose expense.\u201d\n\nHarleen Singh, Senior Associate Provost for Academic and Strategic Initiatives; Director of the Women\u2019s Studies Research Center; and Associate Professor of Literature, South Asian Studies, and Women\u2019s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies, discussed the nature of democracy, noting that it is impossible to find a candidate who is representative of everyone, especially minorities, but that this is all the more reason to participate in the political process. As citizens exercising our right to vote, she said, \u201cthe real question at this time is not about the perfect candidate, but about restoring our faith in the democratic process, in each other, and in community. We can only do that by electing someone who is not intent on driving us further away from each other.\u201d\n\nChaeRan Freeze, Frances and Max Elkon Chair in Modern Jewish History in the Department of Near Eastern and Judaic Studies, focused her discussion on the concept of intimacy in the current political moment and the expectations that have been placed on Kamala Harris due to her race and gender. For marginalized communities in particular, Freeze stated that this cultivated intimacy with a candidate has \u201csparked hopes that Harris\u2019s political priorities will align with our own lives,\u201d and that by electing her, we are opening up possibilities for evolution and change.\n\nAnita Hill, University Professor of Social Policy, Law, and Women\u2019s, Gender and Sexuality Studies, and David R. Pokross Professor of Law and Social Policy, discussed the online rhetoric about Kamala Harris through the lens of gender bias. In questioning how to move beyond negative and hateful speech, Hill asked, \u201cHow do we have conversations about politically and socially explosive issues without relegating them to the demeaning constructions that we place on people because of their identity?\u201d She noted that there are structures in place that make it hard for us to get excited about a Black Asian woman in leadership, and asked the audience to consider the significance of electing someone of a different background as President of the United States.\n\nAfter the four panelists spoke, Madison emphasized that the topics being explored go beyond the election and address how we can coexist as a society despite all our differences. She then opened up the Q&A portion of the event, during which the panelists addressed topics ranging from the impact of having a woman of color take office, the need to keep elected officials accountable for their agendas, and how to encourage responsible civic engagement.\n\nAt the close of the panel discussion, Madison encouraged attendees to \u201ccarry forward the homework that has just been assigned to each of us.\u201d",

        "text": "Immigration in the 2024 US presidential election campaign: policy stalemate, disinformation, and a call for mass deportation\nImmigration has been one of the most contentious and defining issues of the 2024 presidential election, rivaled only by economic policy and national security. The Republican candidate, former President Donald Trump, has largely succeeded in setting the terms of the debate \u2013 hammering away at his Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, with hyperbolic claims that she supports \u201copen borders\u201d and false accusations that the US is experiencing a wave of violent crime committed by migrants.\n\nTrump\u2019s immigration rhetoric relies increasingly on lies, misinformation, and racist stereotypes. But his claim that immigration is \u201cout of control\u201d \u2013 and his insistence that firm measures are needed to address it \u2013 have become central to the Republican platform, and one of Trump\u2019s most frequently repeated campaign promises is that he will deport millions of undocumented immigrants soon after taking office.\n\nWhy is immigration such a controversial issue in the US? How have the different administrations dealt with it? Is it an overused issue in this campaign?\n\nImmigration is an extremely complicated policy area in US politics; its arcane nuances defy understanding for non-specialists. The fact that immigration touches on core identity issues, fear of demographic change, and economic uncertainties makes it an arena ripe for scapegoating and misinformation. A longstanding political stalemate has for decades stifled efforts to create a modernized, more flexible US immigration system, one with enough lawful immigration pathways to meet labor market demand and adequate resources to adjudicate asylum claims in a timely fashion.\n\nGlobally, economic migration and forced displacement has increased, and the smart phone revolution has democratized access to information about migration pathways. The number of migrant encounters at the US border with Mexico has grown significantly over the past 15 years. And the presence of tens of thousands of migrants in cities across the US \u2013 some 120,000 of them having been bussed to northern US cities by Texas Governor Abbott since the summer of 2022 \u2013 lends plausibility to the dominant framing that immigration is a problem to be solved, rather than a complex phenomenon to be managed, let alone an opportunity for maintaining economic growth and national vitality. In that context, those forced to flee their home through violence and persecution are lumped together with economic migrants by anti-immigration forces, and immigration is viewed through the sole lens of national security rather than taking into consideration the economic contributions of migrants or their human security needs.\n\nThe Biden-Harris administration itself has had a mixed record. The positives are impressive. Since President Biden took office in January 2021, the United States has rebuilt and expanded a refugee resettlement system that had been decimated by President Trump. The US has also offered humanitarian protection to hundreds of thousands of Afghans and Ukrainians, extended Temporary Protected Status (TPS) to certain foreign nationals in the US from a record number of 16 countries of origin, and offered temporary entry to persons from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, regardless of their humanitarian protection needs, who can find a sponsor in the United States. But many of these newcomers have precarious legal status, leaving them vulnerable to deportation, particularly in the event of a change in the party in power. And, deeply concerning to migrant rights advocates, the Biden administration has continued or reinstated, albeit in somewhat more humane form, many of the Trump-era restrictions on access to asylum on the southern border.\n\nIn past decades bipartisan efforts at comprehensive immigration reform had recognized a thereefold need: a) improve enforcement of immigration law, b) regularize the undocumented population, and c) create better pathways for future flows of migrants. The Grand Old Party (GOP) side of the debate has long taken an \u201cenforcement first\u201d policy approach: insist a need to \u201csecure the border\u201d before tackling other elements of immigration policy. Under Trump\u2019s leadership, the GOP has essentially shifted to an \u201cenforcement only\u201d policy, one which reduces the complexities of immigration policy to the border and reduces the range of policy solutions to mass deportation and sharp restrictions on future flows. Even in the event of a Harris victory, the heated rhetoric surrounding immigration is unlikely to cool, and it will take a concerted effort \u2013 and a cooperative Congress \u2013 to move toward a more rational, balanced approach to immigration policy, one that would refocus the debate in the direction of economics, human security, and human dignity.\n\nRecent history\n\nToday\u2019s politicized immigration debate has its roots in global and regional developments, and the evolution of US immigration policy over the past half-century. Prior immigration restrictions were largely lifted by the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which eliminated national origins quotas and allowed increased migration from Latin America, Asia, and Africa, and laid the groundwork for subsequent demographic shifts and political debates. Another key development, prompted by the end of the Vietnam War and a surge of refugees from Southeast Asia, was passage of the Refugee Act of 1980, which aligned US law with the international definition of a refugee and established the present-day US Refugee Admissions Program.\n\nBy the 1980s and 1990s, the US saw increasing numbers of undocumented immigrants, particularly from Mexico (though irregular migrant flows from Central America overtook those from Mexico by the 2010s). The last mass regularization policy in the US came in 1986, when the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) provided amnesty to about 3 million undocumented immigrants, while introducing a stringent new employment verification process and imposing sanctions on employers who hired undocumented workers.\n\nThe terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, led to a decisive shift in US immigration policy discourse toward national security concerns. The functions of the Immigration and Naturalization Service were absorbed into the newly created Department of Homeland Security, with its heavy emphasis on border enforcement. Annual admissions of resettled refugees had peaked in the early 1980s and again in the first half of the 1990s, before settling in at annual levels between 70,000 and 85,000 in the latter half of that decade. After September 11, refugee admissions were temporarily halted then resumed slowly; total refugee admission numbers only significantly exceeded 60,000 twice in the following dozen years.\n\nBipartisan efforts to reform the immigration system have faltered. Comprehensive immigration reform was proposed in 2006, 2008, and 2013, each time failing due to political polarization. While there was general agreement on the need for reforms, including pathways to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and improved border security, partisan divisions over enforcement-first approaches and legalization derailed these efforts.\n\nImmigration took on a new, more divisive tone during the 2016 presidential campaign. Donald Trump announced his candidacy on June 16, 2015, with a speech at Trump Tower, New York, in which he infamously stated: \u201cWhen Mexico sends its people, they\u2019re not sending their best\u2026 They\u2019re sending people that have lots of problems, and they\u2019re bringing those problems with us. They\u2019re bringing drugs. They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\u201d Throughout Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, which centrally featured his promise to build a \u201cbig, beautiful wall\u201d on the US-Mexico border, Trump turned again and again to this sort of racist, xenophobic rhetoric equating migrants with criminality.\n\nOnce in office, Trump enacted hundreds of measures to curtail and restrict immigration, access to asylum, and refugee resettlement. A February 2022 report by the Migration Policy Institute found that, in President Trump\u2019s four years in office his administration \u201ccompleted 472 executive actions affecting US immigration policy\u201d. Among the more prominent were travel bans, the separation of children from parents apprehended at the southern border, and the return of most asylum seekers to Mexico. The annual refugee admissions ceiling was reduced stepwise to 15,000 admissions in Trump\u2019s last year in office. Hundreds of other measures, large and small, chipped away at the ability of migrants to enter and remain in the United States.\n\nTrump\u2019s presidency was punctuated by the Covid-19 pandemic, which by March 2020 curtailed the movement of people across the world. In the early months of the pandemic, the Trump administration put in place a series of new travel bans, and invoked a public health law, Title 42, to seal off the border to nearly all asylum seekers.\n\nImmigration, refugee, and asylum policy under the Biden administration\n\nUpon taking office in January 2021, President Biden moved quickly, taking a number of executive actions early in his presidency to reverse many of Trump\u2019s immigration policies. The new president ended the bans on refugees from Muslim-majority countries, stopped family separations at the border (and began efforts to reunite families that had been torn apart), and called for an interagency report on the relationship between climate change and migration. Biden also proposed a pathway to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants, including DACA 1 recipients \u2013 undocumented persons brought into the US as children, who had been granted temporary legal status under President Obama (Congress has yet to pass legislation for these \u201cDreamers\u201d) \u2013 and he temporarily halted deportations while reviewing immigration enforcement policies.\n\nThe new administration also undertook measures to increase refugee admissions to the United States. When Biden took office, the annual refugee ceiling was set at 15,000. In April 2021, he raised it to 63,500 \u2013 a largely symbolic gesture at the time, given the impact of Trump\u2019s cuts to the refugee program and the near-impossibility of overseas refugee processing during the height of the pandemic. Total refugee admissions for the fiscal year were only 11,411: slightly lower than in the last full year of the Trump presidency, and the smallest intake of refugees in the resettlement program\u2019s 40-year history. The refugee program eventually did recover, with over 60,000 admissions in fiscal year 2023 and 100,034 \u2013 the highest level in three decades \u2013 in the fiscal year that ended on September 30, 2024.\n\nJust as the refugee program was beginning to rebuild, the fall of Kabul in August 2021 resulted in a massive flow of Afghan evacuees, over 90,000 of which came to the United States. Approximately 76,000 of these were granted humanitarian parole status, allowing them to live and work in the United States for two years but not providing the same path to permanent residency as did the formal US Refugee Admissions Program. Then came the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, leading to the admissions of a large number of Ukrainians, also under humanitarian parole.\n\nFor Ukrainian parolees, the Biden administration developed an innovative private sponsorship program, Uniting for Ukraine (or U4U). This program, launched in April 2022, gives US citizens and permanent residents the opportunity to welcome Ukrainians for whom they would provide financial support for the duration of their stay in the United States. A similar program, the Process for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans (or CHNV) subsequently provided entry for citizens of those four countries who could find a sponsor group in the US. As of October 2024, more than 230,000 Ukrainians have arrived in the United States under U4U, and about 530,000 arrivals have come through the CHNV program.\n\nThe latter program was part of a suite of measures undertaken by the Biden administration in an effort to manage migration flows from the Western Hemisphere. Another component has been the Safe Mobility Initiative (Movilidad Segura), begun in 2023, which involves the establishment of Safe Mobility Offices (SMOs) in Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Guatemala, allowing applicants to apply from within Latin America for possible lawful pathways to the United States. The SMOs were established in the context of the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection, a June 2022 statement of intent endorsed by the United States, Canada, Mexico, and 19 other Latin American and Caribbean nations. Through the Declaration, partner nations pledged cooperation on root causes, lawful pathways, and humane enforcement.\n\nAt the SMOs, operated in partnership with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Organization for Migration (IOM), applicants are screened for protection needs and \u2013 depending on their eligibility \u2013 may be directed toward one of a number of pathways, including resettlement, humanitarian parole, family unification, and temporary work visas. For some eligible applicants, migration pathways are available to Canada, New Zealand, or Spain. According to the US State Department, as of September 2024 some 242,600 applicants have applied to the Movilidad Segura program, of which 17,600 have been resettled as refugees in the US, and 1,000 have been referred to other countries for resettlement.\n\nJust as the CHNV program and SMOs provide new lawful pathways, the Biden administration has also redoubled its enforcement efforts at the southern US border, with mixed results and negative impacts on the right to access asylum. At first, President Biden reversed the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) the so-called \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy enacted by President Trump in January 2019, under which those seeking asylum at the border were required to stay in Mexico while awaiting an immigration court date. A court ruling resulted in the reinstatement of the MMP by the Biden administration, in a slightly modified form, from December 2021 to October 2022. The Trump-era Title 42 border restrictions also remained in place well into the Biden Administration, lifted only in May 2023 when President Biden declared an end to the Covid emergency.\n\nOn May 11, 2023, the administration replaced Title 42 with new strict controls on asylum through the Circumvention of Lawful Pathways (CLP) Rule. This required would-be asylum seekers to register for an appointment for border screening via an app called \u201cCPB One\u201d, disqualified most of those (non-Mexicans) who had failed to apply for asylum in another country on their way to the United States and imposed other restrictions. Advocacy groups, such as Human Rights First and the National Immigration Forum argued that the CLP rule placed restrictions and conditions on access to asylum that violate US and international law. A year later, in June 2024, asylum access was further constricted by a presidential proclamation paired with an Interim Final Rule on \u201cSecuring the Border\u201d. These measures bar from asylum nearly all who enter the US between ports of entry and shut down the border to asylum seekers when the number of border encounters exceeds 1,500 over a seven-day period. On September 30, the rule was made final and the period over which border encounters must fall below 1,500 was lengthened to 28 days. As the American Immigration Lawyers Association notes, this has the practical effect of closing off access to asylum indefinitely (though the rule does allow for limited exceptions).\n\nOn the Biden administration\u2019s own terms, the combination of the CHNV program and asylum restrictions have indeed resulted in a drastic decrease in migrants entering the US through the southern border. At the end of September, the US Department of Homeland Security issued a fact sheet crediting the June proclamation and Interim Final Rule with a 55% drop in border encounters. And the Pew Research Center notes a sharp fall in border encounters from December 2023 to August 2024, with the steepest decreases (drops of over 95%) among those nationalities provided with alternative pathways via CHNV.\n\nThese changing outcomes at the border have done very little to change political rhetoric. In the final weeks of the electoral campaign, Trump and his vice-presidential running mate J.D. Vance (and many Republicans down the ballot) continue to portray migration and the border as a signal Biden-Harris policy failure. And items number one and two in the 2024 Republican Platform are \u201cSeal the border and stop the migrant invasion\u201d and \u201cCarry out the largest deportation operation in American history\u201d.\n\nAnd as CBS News reported, the Biden administration announced on October 4, 2024 that it would not extend the two-year parole period of those who had entered under CHNV, meaning that \u2013 once their parole period ends \u2013 they will have to apply for another form of immigration relief, leave the country, or face the possibility of deportation.\n\nLies and disinformation in the Trump campaign\n\nOne of the most alarming aspects of the immigration debate in the 2024 election has been the use of lies and disinformation by the Trump campaign. Misinformation about immigrants has long been a tool of political fearmongering, but Trump has taken it to new heights, using false narratives to incite fear and rally his base.\n\nThroughout the campaign, Donald Trump and his surrogates have relied heavily on the rhetorical tactic of associating migrants with criminality. This rhetoric relies heavily on use of sensationalist anecdotes (for example, of murders committed by noncitizens), exaggeration, and outright lies. On July 18, 2024, in Trump\u2019s speech accepting the Republican party\u2019s nomination, Trump spoke in apocalyptic terms of \u201ca massive invasion at our southern border that has spread misery, crime, poverty, disease, and destruction to communities all across our land\u201d.\n\nTrump and the right-wing news outlets and social media have amplified narratives of what they call \u201cmigrant crime\u201d. On a Fox News program in February 2024 (as reported by the Washington Post), Trump boasted of having invented the term himself: \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard this, but I came up with this one\u201d, he told [Fox News host Laura] Ingraham. \u201cMigrant crime. This crime \u2013 there\u2019s violent crime, there\u2019s migrant crime. We have a new category of crime. It\u2019s called migrant crime. And it\u2019s going to be worse than any other form of crime.\u201d\n\nThe basic claim behind the notion of a migrant crime wave has been repeatedly debunked. Reuters note: \u201cA range of studies by academics and think tanks have shown that immigrants do not commit crime at a higher rate than native-born Americans.\u201d And a 2023/2024 working paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research finds that \u201c[a]s a group, immigrants have had lower incarceration rates than the US-born for 150 years\u2026 relative to the US-born, immigrants\u2019 incarceration rates have declined since 1960: immigrants today are 60% less likely to be incarcerated\u201d.\n\nNonetheless, the migrant crime trope persists and is amplified through innumerable social media posts and speeches by Republican candidates. Asylum seekers are blamed for smuggling fentanyl into the country, even though the overwhelming majority of those arrested for smuggling the drug are US citizens. In September 2024, one of the most egregious examples of racist disinformation involved baseless claims that Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio were killing pets for food. Despite local authorities debunking these stories, Trump and his allies have continued to push the narrative, in the process endangering local residents and Haitian immigrants across the country.\n\nImplications of a \u201cmass deportation\u201d policy\n\nOne of the most dangerous aspects of Trump\u2019s immigration policy is his promise of mass deportation, a policy that would have devastating human and economic consequences. Millions of families would be torn apart, as many undocumented immigrants live in \u201cmixed-status\u201d households, where one or more family members are US citizens or legal residents. According to a paper published by the Center for Migration Studies of New York (CMS), mass deportation would break up nearly 5 million American families. This would leave millions of US-born children without their parents, a humanitarian disaster given its incalculable psychological and emotional impact on children and families.\n\nTrump claims that mass deportation would help the economy; he even advocates for deportation as a way of relieving the country\u2019s shortage of affordable housing. But the economic costs of mass deportation at the scale the Trump campaign is promising would be staggering. According to a recent report by the American Immigration Council, a one-time operation to deport over 13 million undocumented people \u201cwould cost at least $315bn\u201d given the cost of arrests, detention, legal processing, and removals. Given the logistical impossibility of deporting that many people at once, the report also estimates that even at a more feasible pace \u201c[d]eporting 1 million immigrants per year would incur an annual cost of $88bn\u201d for ten years.\n\nUndocumented immigrants make up a significant portion of the US workforce, particularly in industries like agriculture, construction, and food services. Deporting millions of workers would create labor shortages in these industries, leading to higher prices for goods and services, particularly food. Undocumented immigrants also contribute billions of dollars in taxes each year, despite being ineligible for many public benefits. CMS estimates that undocumented workers contribute $96.7bn in federal, state, and local taxes annually. Their removal from the workforce would result in a significant loss of tax revenue, further straining public budgets at all levels of government.\n\nThe economic impact would extend beyond the immediate labor market. The removal of millions of consumers from the economy would lead to reduced demand for goods and services, harming businesses and leading to job losses for US citizens. The resulting economic contraction \u2013 particularly if mass deportation were to occur at the same time that high tariffs are being imposed on imported goods \u2013 could push the US into a recession, with the most vulnerable communities bearing the brunt of the impact.\n\nMoreover, mass deportation would likely lead to violent resistance, as many migrants would refuse to leave quietly. This could result in widespread unrest, with potentially deadly consequences for both immigrants and law enforcement. Beyond the immediate economic and social costs, mass deportation would have long-term consequences for American society. It would deepen racial and ethnic divisions, create a permanent underclass of people living in fear of deportation, and erode trust in law enforcement. And even though the majority of immigrants currently in the United States (and the majority of those entering the country each year) have legal status, this matters little in the political debate, although a deportation dragnet aimed at the undocumented would affect lawfully present immigrants as well, either as part of mixed-status families or as targets of generalized anti-migrant actions.\n\nIn lieu of a conclusion\n\nAnd what of a Harris administration? Most analysts foresee \u2013 and the 2024 Democratic Party Platform posits \u2013 a policy mix fundamentally similar to the Biden administration, combining lawful migration pathways with strong enforcement mechanisms and a push for Congressional action on comprehensive immigration reform. Candidate Harris has blamed Trump for pressuring Senate Republicans to vote against a border bill that narrowly failed to pass in May 2024 (the bill was also opposed by several Democrats, who considered it too punitive toward migrants). But by and large the Democratic nominee has not chosen to directly engage Trump on the specifics of immigration policy. The country awaits some future political season for the return of an honest, bipartisan, fact-based discussion of immigration policy.\n\nNotes:\n\n1- Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24241/NotesInt.2024/311/en\n\nAll the publications express the opinions of their individual authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of CIDOB or its donors",

        "text": "Operation Overload Impersonates Media to Influence 2024 US Election\nSummary\n\nOperation Overload, a Russia-aligned influence operation, is aggressively targeting the 2024 US presidential election. Using fake news, fact-checking sites, and AI-generated audio, it seeks to manipulate public opinion by impersonating trusted media organizations. This campaign primarily targets media outlets, fact-checkers, and researchers, aiming to overwhelm investigative resources and insert false narratives into mainstream discourse, but also directly targets the general public. Operation Overload previously attempted to undermine the 2024 French elections and the Paris Olympics, although with minimal success. Its goal now is to undermine trust in the US election process, exploit divisive social issues, stoke fears of political violence, and target candidates, particularly Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nOperation Overload Impersonates Media to Influence US Election\n\nOperation Overload, also known as Matryoshka and Storm-1679, is a sophisticated Russia-aligned influence campaign designed to manipulate public opinion and sow discord. Previously attempting to undermine the 2024 French elections and the Paris Olympics, the operation is now shifting its focus to the 2024 US presidential election. It involves creating fake news sites, false fact-checking resources, and AI-generated audio that mimics legitimate media outlets. By impersonating trusted news organizations, the operation seeks to establish credibility to influence its targets more effectively.\n\nKey Tactics and Techniques\n\nImpersonation of Trusted Media Brands: Operation Overload relies heavily on impersonating reputable news outlets to lend credibility to its influence operations. By copying logos, using similar fonts and layouts, and falsely attributing content to real journalists, it creates content that appears legitimate. This includes recycling video and image materials from publicly available sources and generating professional-sounding AI-generated voiceovers. AI-Generated Content: One of the newer developments in Operation Overload's toolkit is the use of AI to generate realistic voiceovers. This content, often used in short videos, further amplifies its perceived credibility and makes it more challenging to differentiate between legitimate and fake information. Targeting of Media and Fact-Checking Organizations: Operation Overload directs much of its focus toward media organizations, fact-checkers, and researchers. By flooding them with spam-like requests and fake fact-checking leads, the operation seeks to overwhelm their resources. This makes it harder for them to debunk Russian disinformation and risks them inadvertently reporting on false content, thereby injecting Russian malign narratives into mainstream political discourse. Amplification Through Automated Social Media: The operation also utilizes automated bots to spread its influence content on social media. This tactic, referred to as coordinated inauthentic behavior (CIB), helps amplify false narratives on social media platforms, making the content more widespread and visible to the general public.\n\nThe Role of AI in Operation Overload\n\nOne of the newer developments of Operation Overload is its reliance on AI-generated audio. AI is being used to create voiceovers and make fake media content appear to be from legitimate media outlets. This allows for the rapid production of high-quality disinformation at scale, making it more challenging to detect and debunk.\n\nImpacts on the 2024 US Election\n\nThe operation's primary goal is to overwhelm journalists and fact-checkers with persistent, spam-like requests to verify the operation\u2019s inauthentic content, diverting resources from pursuing legitimate investigations and debunking Russian disinformation. The operation also hopes to use media organizations as a means of information laundering, more specifically, to inject malign content and pro-Kremlin narratives into mainstream political discourse via trusted parties. Finally, the operation seeks to directly inject influence content into mainstream discussion of contentious political issues, eroding public trust in the democratic process, provoking US domestic concerns of political violence and \u201ccivil war\u201d, and exploiting existing social divisions.\n\nSome of the narratives pushed by Operation Overload include:\n\nStoking Fears of Political Violence: By amplifying concerns about civil unrest and even civil war, the operation seeks to provoke fear and uncertainty.\n\nBy amplifying concerns about civil unrest and even civil war, the operation seeks to provoke fear and uncertainty. Targeting Candidates: Vice President Harris, in particular, is a major target of the operation's disinformation efforts. Content falsely links her to a wide range of scandals, aiming to damage her reputation ahead of the election.\n\nVice President Harris, in particular, is a major target of the operation's disinformation efforts. Content falsely links her to a wide range of scandals, aiming to damage her reputation ahead of the election. Vilifying Ukrainians and the LGBTQIA+ Community: The operation provokes negative sentiment toward these communities to decrease public support for Ukraine and exploit social divisions in the US, respectively.\n\nMitigations\n\nMitigating the potential effects of Operation Overload requires a coordinated effort between media organizations, fact-checkers, researchers, and policymakers. Here are key steps that can be taken:\n\nMonitoring Social Media Channels: Potentially targeted organizations should regularly monitor Telegram and social media channels identified in this report as promoting Operation Overload content, using appropriate operational security measures. Strengthening Fact-Checking Protocols: Media organizations should strengthen verification processes and source authentication measures where possible to prevent the unintentional spread of Operation Overload content. Information Sharing: These organizations should also enhance information-sharing and coordination with their peers and the broader counter-influence community to decrease the likelihood of publishing a false fact-checking lead or inadvertently overexerting resources to pursue a deceptive lead. Public Awareness and Media Literacy: Public education about how influence operations work is crucial. The general public needs to be aware of how to identify false information and be more discerning about the sources it trusts. Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud: Media entities, researchers, and public sector organizations can use the Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud to track research developments and other analyses of Operation Overload\u2019s emerging narratives ahead of the 2024 US election and its continued activities in Europe. Defenders can also use the Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud to monitor developments in previously documented and emerging influence operations from nation-state adversaries. Recorded Future Brand Intelligence: Media organizations can use Recorded Future Brand Intelligence to track and combat brand abuse, including attempted typosquatting and logo impersonation.\n\nOutlook\n\nAs the 2024 US election draws nearer, Operation Overload is very likely to ramp up its activities. The operation's administrators are expected to impersonate more media outlets and expand their reach. We expect Operation Overload to continue attempting to fuel polarization in the US by pushing narratives that deepen existing divisions on controversial issues and discredit key political figures like Vice President Harris and, to a much lesser extent, former President Donald Trump.\n\nAs Insikt Group continues to track growing concerns regarding election security and integrity, Operation Overload will likely amplify conspiracy theories around voter fraud and rigged elections, posing as legitimate media, to undermine confidence in the democratic process.\n\nTo read the entire analysis, click here to download the report as a PDF.",

        "text": "FIU Cuba Poll 2024: Cuban American voters\u2019 support for Trump at an all-time high\nSixty-eight percent of likely Cuban Americans voters in Miami-Dade County said they would check off the name of former President Donald Trump on the ballot in November, according to the 2024 FIU Cuba Poll released today. Twenty-three percent reported they plan to vote for Vice President Kamala Harris. Five percent remained undecided.\n\nSixty-eight percent is the highest recorded approval rate for Trump among Cuban Americans on the FIU Cuba Poll, which is the longest running survey of Cuban Americans in the country, tracking the community since 1991. The 2016 poll registered 35% approval for Trump, while the 2020 came in at 59%. The 2024 approval rate is also greater than the actual Cuban American vote for Trump in the last two presidential elections.\n\n\u201cIt seems that the Trump train is still picking up passengers on Calle Ocho,\u201d said Guillermo Grenier, lead investigator on the Cuba Poll and a professor of sociology in the Department of Global and Sociocultural Studies at the Steven J. Green School of International & Public Affairs, which sponsors the poll along with FIU\u2019s Cuban Research Institute. \u201cCuban Americans born outside of Cuba being the exception, the Cuban American community remains loyal to the Republican Party and the Trump version of it.\u201d\n\nThe 2024 Cuba Poll surveyed 1,001 Cuban Americans in Miami-Dade County by phone between Sept. 25 and Oct. 9. Questions about the election were posed only to the likely voters (U.S. Citizens) among the responders.\n\nWhile Republicans continue to maintain a majority among registered Cuban American voters (55%), Cuban Americans born outside of Cuba are divided in their party allegiance: 38% are registered Republicans, 33% are Democrats and 26% are Independents (No Party Affiliation).\n\nIn the Florida senate election, U.S. Senator Rick Scott is expected to receive 50% of the Cuban American vote, while challenger Debbie Mucarsel-Powell will garner approximately 19% of the decided voters. A relatively large undecided segment (22%) makes the race for the U.S. Senate seat closer than expected, given Scott\u2019s previous overwhelming support from the community.\n\nOn other issues, including U.S. policy toward Cuba, there is much more diversity of opinion.\n\nDemocratic and Republican supporters differ in their evaluation of the most important issues facing the country.\n\nFor Republican supporters, the top issues, ranked, are: (1) the economy, (2) immigration, (3) access to health care, (4) relations with China, (5) relations with Russia, (6) relations with Cuba, (7) race relations, (8) assault weapons accessibility and (9) access to safe abortion care.\n\nFor Democrats, the top issues are (1) access to health care, (2) access to safe abortion care, (3) the economy, (4) assault weapons accessibility, (5) race relations, (6) immigration, (7) relations with Russia, (8) relations with Cuba and (9) relations with China.\n\nOn the issue of the U.S. embargo against Cuba, 55% of Cuban Americans in South Florida support its continuation, although they also show relatively high support for some engagement policies such as the selling of food (61% support) and medicine (69% support) to the island. Support for the continuation of the embargo drops to 43% among Cuban Americans not born on the island.\n\n\u201cThis year\u2019s findings confirm a long trend of Cuban American support for a sophisticated policy approach that combines sanctions against the regime while engaging with the Cuban people,\u201d said Sebastian Arcos, interim director of the Cuban Research Institute. \u201cCuban Americans have a better grasp of the issues and policy trade-offs involved than most experts and policy makers. Maintaining the U.S. embargo is at the core of this approach, which largely explains Cuban American\u2019s traditional inclinations toward the Republican Party and strong support for Donald Trump\u2019s policies.\u201d",

        "text": "Where Kamala Harris stands on 10 key policy issues, from immigration to guns\nWhere Kamala Harris stands on 10 key issues, from immigration to guns\n\nBBC\n\nVice-President Kamala Harris became the Democratic Party's nominee for president relatively late in the 2024 contest - having replaced Joe Biden - and she then selected Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate. She released a detailed policy guide in early September offering voters a sense of what a Harris-Walz administration might look like. This focuses on her economic and foreign policy agenda, and highlights her most urgent priority to tackle the cost of living. Here are her key policy pledges. Who is Kamala Harris?\n\nWho is Tim Walz?\n\nWhere Donald Trump stands on 10 key issues\n\nEconomy\n\nAs vice-president, Ms Harris worked with President Biden to pass major economic legislation - regularly labelled \"Bidenomics\" - which included major investments in infrastructure and green energy. Growth and jobs creation have been strong but inflation and high interest rates continue to hit American wallets. In her convention acceptance speech, the vice-president promised mortgage assistance for first-time homebuyers, a tax credit for parents of newborns and bans on price gouging at the grocery store to help target inflation. She added that her plans would create \"an opportunity economy where everyone has a chance to compete and a chance to succeed\". In her first interview as the Democratic nominee with CNN, Ms Harris said that one of her highest priorities was \"to support and strengthen the middle class\", a theme she has repeated on the campaign trail. US election polls: Who is ahead - Harris or Trump?\n\nTaxes\n\nIn 2017, while a senator, Ms Harris supported a number of progressive tax programmes. She co-sponsored a bill with former presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders to expand social security for the elderly by increasing the tax rate on investments. As a presidential candidate in 2019, she supported a corporate tax rate of 35%, up from 21%. This was more aggressive than President Biden's proposal, which she also backed, to increase the rate to 28%. During her acceptance speech after being confirmed as the Democratic candidate, she said she would \"pass a middle class tax cut that will benefit more than 100 million Americans\". This refers to the restoration of the Child Tax Credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit. Restoring the expanded Child Tax Credit would give families with newborn children a $6,000 (\u00a34,630) tax cut. A campaign official also told the BBC that the vice-president would continue to back President Biden's proposal to not raise taxes on Americans earning less than $400,000 (\u00a3310,000).\n\nAbortion\n\nMs Harris has long supported abortion rights. She was the first vice-president to visit an abortion clinic, and toured the country after the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022 to address state abortion bans - often framing the issue as a matter of personal freedom. She has made abortion central to her campaign, and continues to advocate for legislation that would safeguard reproductive rights nationwide. \u201cWhen Congress passes a law to restore reproductive freedoms, as president of the United States, I will sign it into law,\u201d she said at a campaign rally in Atlanta, Georgia. She has reiterated that commitment several times, including during the ABC News debate with Donald Trump.\n\nImmigration\n\nMs Harris's position on the border has become more moderate over time. On the campaign trail, she has reiterated her continued support for the cross-party border security bill that would have included hundreds of millions of dollars for border wall construction. It was torpedoed by congressional Republicans in February 2024 at Trump's urging. It would have fast-tracked decisions on asylum cases, limited humanitarian parole, and expanded the authority to deport migrants. The vice-president says she would revive the bill and sign it into law. She has also said there \"should be consequences\" for people who cross the US border unlawfully, though she previously supported a more lenient approach. As vice-president, she was tasked with tackling the root causes of the record numbers of Central American migrants crossing the southern border. Those numbers spiked during the Biden administration, but have declined in recent months. She helped raise $3bn - largely from private companies - to fund regional investments designed to encourage residents to remain in their home countries.\n\nNato and Ukraine aid\n\nMs Harris's early career focused largely on domestic issues and those affecting the state of California, but she has become more involved in foreign policy since being elected to the US Senate. As vice-president, she has met 150 world leaders and visited 21 countries. She attended the Munich Security Conference in February 2024, where she spoke in support of western security alliance Nato and denounced Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Ms Harris has vowed to support Ukraine \u201cfor as long as it takes\u201d, and represented the US at Kyiv's \u201cpeace conference\u201d in Switzerland in June 2024. In her speech at the Democratic convention, she said she warned Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky about Russian aggression five days before the invasion, and had \"helped mobilise a global response\" after the war began. The vice-president has also pledged, if elected, to reject isolationism and ensure that \"America - not China - wins the competition for the 21st Century\".\n\nIsrael-Gaza War\n\nMs Harris has been a long-time advocate for a two-state solution in the region, and has called for an end to the war in Gaza. In her convention acceptance speech, she pledged as president to ensure \"that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom, and self-determination\". As vice-president, she was one of the first people in the Biden administration to call for an \"immediate ceasefire\", raise concerns over the \"humanitarian catastrophe for Palestinians\" and charge Israel with ending the conflict. She raised these issues in what she called \"frank and constructive\" talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when he visited Washington in July. However, she has not supported the arms embargo on Israel which some on the US left want. At the party convention, she said she would \"always stand up for Israel's right to defend itself\". She reiterated her support for the country during the debate with Trump, saying \"I have my entire career and life supported Israel and the Israeli people\". In her CNN interview, Ms Harris indicated that she would focus on securing a ceasefire deal, which was President Biden's approach.\n\nHealthcare\n\nEarlier in her career, Ms Harris supported expanding publicly-funded healthcare programmes that cover the elderly, youth with disabilities and poor. This included backing Medicare-for-All, a progressive policy that would make all healthcare publicly funded. She later softened her support for this. Her campaign told the BBC that she would not push for a single-payer system if elected to the White House. During her vice-presidency, the White House has had health care successes. It reduced prescription drug costs, capped insulin prices at $35, allowed Medicare to negotiate drug prices and capped out-of-pocket expenses for Medicare drug coverage. On the campaign trail, she has said that she wants to erase billions of dollars in medical debt for Americans and would work with states on the issue. Details remain thin, but when she was the California attorney general, Ms Harris regularly used anti-trust laws to put pressure on insurers, hospitals and drug companies to address costs.\n\nCrime\n\nMs Harris started her legal career prosecuting child abusers and sex traffickers before being elected district attorney of San Francisco, and then serving as California's attorney general. She was criticised by the progressive left for increasing conviction rates - particularly of violent criminals - and was at times labelled \"a cop\" - though the right has also accused her of being soft on crime. Ms Harris has also used her past as a prosecutor to serve as a major contrast with her opponent, who was convicted on 34 charges in a hush-money scheme to illegally influence the 2016 election. She mentioned Mr Trump's conviction - and that he had been found liable for committing sexual abuse - in her Democratic party conference acceptance speech.\n\nGun laws\n\nMs Harris has a history of backing gun safety regulations throughout her political career. While California's attorney general, she successfully defended the state's gun laws when they faced legal challenges. As vice-president, she has overseen the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention. Earlier this year, she announced resources to support the implementation of red-flag laws, which are designed to deny firearms to those who may harm themselves and others. She also encouraged states to tap into $750m in federal funds that the Biden-Harris administration made available for crisis intervention programmes. Her policy platform includes a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines as well as a requirement for universal background checks. During the debate she noted that both she and her vice-presidential nominee Tim Walz are gun owners.\n\nClimate and fracking",

        "text": "Russia-linked influence campaign shifts focus to US presidential election: report\nA Russia-aligned influence operation that peddles in fake news and fact-checking content has been dedicating \u201csignificant resources\u201d aimed at the U.S. presidential election and particularly Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 campaign, according to new research.\n\nOperation Overload, also referred to as Matryoshka and Storm-1679, has been observed in recent months sharing and amplifying videos across social media that spoof major news outlets to spread election-related disinformation, according to a report published Wednesday by Recorded Future.\n\nThe findings come one day after federal intelligence officials warned that Russia and other adversaries will intensify their influence efforts in the two-week run-up to the election. Russia, for example, was responsible for an attack video that widely circulated on social media last week purporting to show a former student of vice presidential nominee Tim Walz.\n\nOperation Overload had previously focused on spreading anti-Ukraine propaganda and content about the Paris Olympic Games. Microsoft first reported last month that the group was behind several fictitious videos targeting the Harris campaign.\n\nRecorded Future researchers warned about the group ramping up its activities to promote existing false Harris narratives, but said it is also targeting former President Donald Trump, albeit to a lesser extent. Like previous Russian influence operations, the campaign aims to undermine trust in the democratic process instead of actually tipping the scales in favor of a particular candidate.\n\nFor example, in a video shared by a now-suspended X account, a BBC impersonation falsely claimed that Trump had received an endorsement from Norwegian neo-Nazi Anders Behring Breivik, the researchers found. In another video shared on Telegram, a Fox News impersonation falsely suggested that the Trump campaign pressured Kentucky Fried Chicken\u2019s parent company to file a fictitious lawsuit against Harris.\n\nOther content shared by now-suspended X accounts impersonated Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and vice presidential candidate JD Vance, according to the Recorded Future researchers. The Record is an editorially independent unit of Recorded Future.\n\nMuch of the content spread by Operation Overload uses fake expert testimonials, allegedly eyewitness content that\u2019s difficult to verify and artificial intelligence-generated voiceovers to produce professional-quality content. It also frequently recycles photo and video materials from publicly available sources, and impersonates legitimate news sources.\n\n\u201cOperation Overload\u2019s media impersonation and production likely require substantial resources and individuals with domain expertise, particularly those skilled in public relations, marketing, programming, and content creation,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe operation also requires individuals tasked with monitoring US and international news to identify potential themes for content creation, as well as individuals tasked with coordinating and carrying out the operation\u2019s email and automated social media campaigns.\u201d\n\nGiven the resources and expertise involved, along with Operation Overload\u2019s strategic alignment with Kremlin interests, the researchers said the group likely has an ongoing relationship with Russian government organizations.\n\nAdditionally, email campaigns and social media spam linked to the group suggests that its targeted audience might not be general American voters. Instead, its priority appears to be media organizations themselves.\n\n\u201cBy overwhelming their investigative resources, the operation aims to prevent them from debunking Russian disinformation and hopes these organizations will inadvertently report on its content, thereby injecting malign narratives into mainstream political discourse via trusted parties,\u201d the researchers said.",

That included 95% of Democrats, while slightly more than half of Republicans, or 52%, agreed.\n\nThe partisan split persists across election-related issues.\n\n\u201cTexas voters feel more confident that elections in Texas and in their home counties will be conducted fairly, with 85% saying they believe that about state elections and 86% saying the same about county elections, but it varies by partisan affiliation,\u201d said Ren\u00e9e Cross, researcher and senior executive director of the Hobby School. \u201cFor example, 92% of Republicans have confidence in elections conducted in Texas, along with 87% of independents. Yet that level of confidence drops to 77% among Democrats.\u201d\n\nThe split is reversed for national elections. Overall, 69% of voters are confident the U.S. election will be conducted fairly and accurately, including 95% of Democrats, 59% of independents and 45% of Republicans.\n\nMark P. Jones, political science fellow at Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute for Public Policy and senior research fellow at the Hobby School, said researchers found broad agreement on some perceived threats.\n\n\u201cNine out of 10 voters agree the influence of money in politics poses a threat to democracy \u2026\u201d - Mark P. Jones, political science fellow at Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute for Public Policy and senior research fellow at the Hobby School\n\n\u201cNine out of 10 voters agree the influence of money in politics poses a threat to democracy, and that cut across racial, partisan and other demographic lines,\u201d Jones said. \u201cMore than eight out of 10, or 82%, said the same about biased media coverage.\u201d\n\nWhile more than half of voters, 56%, say they are confident non-citizens won\u2019t be allowed to vote in the presidential election, opinions differed among groups of voters \u2014 89% of Democrats agreed, compared to 48% of independents and 26% of Republicans. Among younger voters, 79% are confident non-citizens won\u2019t be allowed to vote; that dropped to 38% among older voters.\n\nAmong the report\u2019s other findings:\n\n57% expressed confidence votes cast by mail nationwide will be counted as voters intend. That includes 74% of Black voters, 58% of Latino voters and 55% of white voters. 69% of Democrats agreed, along with 53% of independents and 37% of Republicans.\n\n43% say voter suppression is a major problem at the national level, compared to 38% who say it is a major problem in Texas and 25% who say that about local elections.\n\nHalf of voters say fraud is a major problem in elections nationwide. That drops to 22% for Texas elections and to 21% for local elections. Republicans are far more likely to be concerned about electoral fraud, with 77% of Republicans identifying fraud as a major problem in elections nationwide, compared to 45% of independents and 23% of Democrats.\n\n76% said the use of the legal system to target opponents is a threat to democracy, a view held most strongly by Republicans (90%), older voters (84%), voters with only a high school education (81%) and white voters (80%).\n\n71% rank attempts to overthrow the government as a serious threat to democracy.\n\n70% say gerrymandering of legislative districts is a serious threat to democracy.\n\n81% support requiring Texas voters to provide an ID before casting a ballot, while 56% support online voter registration. Texas requires voter ID but does not allow online registration. 50% support allowing anyone to vote by mail for any reason. Texas restricts no-excuse mail voting to Texans 65 and older.\n\nThe full report is available on the Hobby School website. The survey was conducted between Sept. 26 and Oct. 10 in English and Spanish. The margin of error is +/-2.69%. Earlier reports in the Texas Votes series covered the 2024 statewide and Harris County elections. An upcoming report will focus on Harris County voters\u2019 opinions about elections and democracy, and a final report will explore attitudes about electricity infrastructure and distribution.",

        "text": "American Presidential Election: What Is at Stake for the EU-US Partnership\nEurope is obsessively looking at the next US Presidential elections. Very few of the continent\u2019s main news outlets miss a daily reference to the event which will determine, arguably, the future destiny of the European Union.\n\nWhat seems to be a sort of obsession has many good reasons to be: whatever the future US administration will be, some relevant decisions will be taken on the other side of the Atlantic, in terms of both geopolitical orientation and strategic priorities.\n\nAs in a crumbling partnership between two comedians, one half of the pair is finding new interests and opportunities. The other is left alone in search of a new identity.\n\nThat of the \u201cless brilliant\u201d partner is, however, a vision which implicitly assigns to Europe the role of appendix of the US, in the new world order which followed the end of World War II. A partner ancillary to an American hegemonic international leadership. According to another \u2013 equally pessimistic \u2013 perspective, the European inclination towards mutual destruction found a stable containment only thanks to US patronage.\n\nNotwithstanding the linearity of this interpretation, one may suggest a slightly different perspective, with the (necessary) help of some historical sensibility.\n\nFor a number of geographic, cultural, religious and demographic reasons, Europe has always been the place in which hegemonic conflicts have been not only more frequent, but also characterized by the utmost ferocious slaughtering of human beings.\n\nThe political history of Europe has been characterized by an obsessive alternation of sheer brutality and attempts to put it under control. Europeans have frequently tried to engineer their own survival amidst clashes of different natures. They have been pretty good at it.\n\nEuropeans invented the concept of the modern state in 1648 with the Peace of Westphalia, ending decades of murdering in the name of the same God. Much later, after the Napoleonic Wars \u2013 which devastated the continent for more than a decade \u2013 the main European powers successfully informally sealed a stable, centennial period of peace with the two \u201cConcerts of Europe\u201d, pushing their aggressive search for \u201cliving space\u201d to the expenses of the subject populations in their colonial empires in Africa and Asia.\n\nWhat took place between 1914 and 1945 can be seen, again, as a series of hegemonic conflicts which took a toll of not less than 30 million human lives \u2013 not to mention the Holocaust, the mutilated, or those permanently affected by post-traumatic stress disorders of whatever nature.\n\nThe offspring of this enduring devastations \u2013 that is, us \u2013 are often the first to forget that the project of a united Europe has been the last in time among a long series of attempts to put a remedy to the continent\u2019s tendency to self-destruction.\n\nIt is worth remembering that the origins of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) lie in the Treaty of Brussels, signed in 1948, as a military defensive alliance between France, the United Kingdom, and Benelux, built in order to prevent the possibility of other hegemonic wars on the continent.",

Assign a research project about state and local government officials and elections that encourages students to explore:\n\nThe purposes of government and the various roles within a government.\n\nThe rights and responsibilities attached to citizenship in a specific country.\n\nHow state and local governments function in the United States.\n\nDebate the effectiveness of the Electoral College\n\nThe Founding Fathers established the Electoral College to make sure citizens of all states\u2014no matter their population or size\u2014got a fair chance at electing the United States' next leaders. But not everyone thinks the Electoral College is a beneficial institution.

Have students debate the legal voting age by reviewing content like:\n\nA video about who has the right to vote in the United States.\n\nAn explainer article that discusses the voting process and voter eligibility in our country.\n\nAn article that looks at the issues surrounding the debate over lowering the voting age from 18 to 16 in elections.\n\nDebate the voting rights of incarcerated U.S. citizens\n\nIn most states, people who are currently incarcerated or who have previously been incarcerated are no longer eligible to vote in elections. Some people believe this isn\u2019t a fair practice. Have students debate this issue by reviewing content like:\n\nA pro/con article that looks at the benefits and drawbacks of allowing incarcerated people to vote .\n\nAn article that dissects the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution , which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nA 2016 news article that discussed restored voting rights for about 13,000 formerly incarcerated people in Virginia.\n\nTeach \u201cElection Day, November, 1884\u201d by Walt Whitman\n\nElections talk even makes its way into fiction and literary nonfiction. Show students how elections can be the topic of poems by doing the following lesson:\n\nBefore reading, have students build background knowledge on the 1884 election .\n\nThen, assign Walt Whitman\u2019s \u201cElection Day, November, 1884.\u201d\n\nEnd with a whole class discussion about the piece, and ask students to answer questions like, \u201cWhat did Whitman say about the 1884 presidential election,\u201d or \u201cHow was the 1884 election similar to or different from our current election cycle?\u201d\n\nExplore the rhetoric behind campaigns and elections\n\nElection campaigns often use rhetoric\u2014or the art of persuasion\u2014to encourage people to agree with a candidate\u2019s point of view on key issues and vote for them. You can use our Elections, Campaigns, and Rhetorical Analysis collection to help students understand how rhetoric works in politics.

        "text": "Majority of Americans are stressed by the election, survey finds. Here's how to cope.\nIf the upcoming presidential election is stressing you out, you're not alone. More than 69% of American adults feel the same, according to a new survey from the American Psychological Association.\n\nThe survey, conducted online in August by The Harris Poll on behalf of the APA, included more than 3,300 adults aged 18 or older who reside in the U.S.\n\nOther top stressors included the future of the nation, which is weighing on 77% of adults surveyed.\n\nCalifornia resident Andrew Peyton told CBS News he's feeling the stress.\n\n\"It doesn't help to have your phone buzzing with headlines and stuff. There's always kind of like a background radiation of stress happening,\" he said.\n\nVanessa Apkenas, another California resident, said her stress \"trickles down from the political landscape of the last several years.\"\n\nCompared with the previous two U.S. presidential elections, stress levels in this survey were similar to the 2020 election, but significantly higher than in 2016.\n\n\"What sets the 2024 poll apart from previous APA election surveys is the collective stress about the potential fallout from the election results,\" a news release for the survey noted.\n\n\"Over 70% of people are concerned about election violence or violence coming out of the election,\" APA CEO Arthur C. Evans told CBS News. \"And over half saying that they're concerned that this election could mean the end of democracy. And what's striking about that is that both Democrats and Republicans are not that different on those two issues.\"\n\nDespite the stress, more than 60% of adults surveyed are feeling hopeful about changes the election will bring.\n\nIf you're not feeling positive, experts say there are ways to cope.\n\n\"For election-related stress, being engaged in the political process is an important way to manage our stress,\" Evans said. \"Limiting the amount of information that you're taking in, particularly when you're tired, is also another very important coping strategy.\"\n\nPsychiatrist Dr. Sue Varma recently told CBS News she suggests setting a timer on social media apps to limit doomscrolling and setting boundaries on phone notifications.\n\n\"It's really important to have and carve out sacred spaces throughout your day where you don't have constant notifications,\" she said. \"(For) a lot of people \u2014 when you're having conversations, you're at the dinner table \u2014 that the phone is constantly telling you, moment by moment, what's happening in the news, and that's really hard to pay attention, to be productive, to be able to connect with family members.\"\n\nFocusing on what you can control can also help, psychologist Dr. Susan Albers of the Cleveland Clinic previously told CBS Pittsburgh.\n\n\"We have a natural tendency to want to feel in control and the elections can undermine that feeling of control,\" she said. \"We need to focus on what we can control versus what we can't, whether that is your daily routine, exercise, and self-care.\"",

        "text": "New seminar takes a deep dive into presidential election law\nNorman Williams\n\nAs the highly contested U.S. presidential election nears its conclusion with the Nov. 5 elections around the corner, Willamette University law professor Norman Williams anticipates that both parties will turn to the courts to either preserve their victory or challenge a loss.\n\nWilliams foresees dozens of legal challenges concentrated in swing states. \u201cThe states with a 15% margin of victory or more won\u2019t have issues,\u201d Williams says. \u201cInstead, there will likely be challenges in about seven swing states and a congressional district in Nebraska where the vote counts are tight and decided by about a one percent margin.\n\nWilliams, the director of Willamette Law\u2019s Center for Constitutional Government and a constitutional law expert, is one of a few scholars nationwide whose research focuses on the presidential nomination and election process.\n\nWilliams\u2019s new course, a seminar on the law of U.S. presidential elections, examines how the two major parties choose their nominees, the rules governing that process, the electoral college and alternatives to that system, and reasons why the U.S. doesn\u2019t have a nationwide primary and has a decentralized, state-by-state process instead.\n\nThe seminar has proven to be very popular. \u201cIt\u2019s a timely course,\u201d Williams says. \u201cWe hit the cap on the number of students in the course, and I agreed to waive it because there was so much interest.\u201d Williams said he plans to offer the seminar during non-presidential election years.\n\nWilliams also teaches Elections Law, a course he first designed in 2008. \u201cWe\u2019re the only law school in the state to have that course, which makes Willamette Law unique,\u201d Williams says. The course includes discussions on the right to vote, ballot access restrictions, reapportionment and redistricting, and partisan gerrymandering, among other constitutional and statutory provisions regulating elections in the U.S.\n\nStudents also learn how to apply historical legal issues to the present with texts and legal principles that might date back to the 18th century. \u201cEvery week, the discussion is an engagement in what that means for 2024,\u201d Williams explains.\n\nWilliams' expertise and enthusiasm for the subject matter make his courses engaging for both graduate and undergraduate students. Through his instruction, students gain exposure to governmental processes and are empowered to take an active, participatory role.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m interested in questions of how we run our democracy \u2014 what are the rules that govern how we, the people, elect the governors, senators, and presidents who run the government?\u201d Williams says. \u201cI\u2019m also interested in exploring the extent to which those rules are democratic, and how much say people have.\u201d\n\n\u201cI try to convey to students that this is something that we all should be interested in as members of the republic.\u201d\n\nHero Photo Credit: The White House",

        "text": "Erik Jones discusses the US election and the future transatlantic relationship\nWe are all following the news on the US presidential contest daily. What are the highlights of the political debate from your point of view as an expert in International Political Economy?\n\nUS political debates tend to fall outside the academic sub-discipline of international political economy. The big issues are primarily domestic, including Donald Trump\u2019s promise to levy across-the-board tariffs. The debate is not about whether the policy is protectionist or how it might distort the global economy, but whether these tariffs would tax consumers. This is not surprising. International relations rarely feature in domestic political debates, and economic policy is often too subtle to make good political arguments. When combined, international relations and economy policy \u2013 which is a big chunk of what academic study as \u2018international political economy\u2019 \u2013 tend to fall out of the public conversation.\n\nOther important topics are missing from the debate. Neither candidate spends much time discussing climate change or multilateral cooperation needed for effective climate action. They also avoid focusing on international development. If anything, they want to hide those issues or at least the dimensions most clearly associated with the international political economy. Donald Trump criticises Kamala Harris for failing as the \u2018border czar\u2019 tackling the immigration problem; Harris rarely pushes back by to explain her role in promoting conditions in Central and South America to reduce immigration incentives. She is not avoiding responsibility for that portfolio. Her team recognises that to move the needle, she should go to the border to announce tougher border policies. Again, the focus is domestic.\n\nThough we have seen the deterioration of the transatlantic relationship after Trump entered the presidential office in 2016, in one of your publications, you mention that \u201cthe Trump administration is more a symptom than a cause of the changes taking place\u201d. How do you see the transatlantic relationship evolving after the 2024 vote?\n\nThe transatlantic relationship, like any other, has its ups and downs and evolves over time. Clearly, this election will impact perceptions across the Atlantic. Europeans will celebrate if Harris wins and try to adjust if she does not. That result may be only temporary. We saw how quickly Europeans fell into and out of love with Barack Obama and how they managed when Trump was first elected. But that is typical of ups and downs. The bigger question is the long-term trajectory, and unfortunately for fans of the transatlantic partnership, the trend lines are heading in the wrong direction. Veronica Anghel and I explored this in a recent article for Political Science Quarterly, showing how both sides of the Atlantic are increasingly focused on domestic challenges and less invested in their partnership. This remains true despite the solidarity sparked by Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. While everyone recognised the importance of NATO and transatlantic cooperation, that recognition does not guarantee policies that will strengthen the bond. Who wins in November matters, but what is more important is whether Europeans and Americans make a conscious choice to work together to tackle shared challenges.\n\nAt the beginning of this presidential campaign, you spent some time in the US. What were some impressions you had from people and colleagues you talked to?\n\nYour question made me smile because it suggests presidential campaigns have a clear beginning. This one feels endless\u2014we even had to replace a candidate! That sense of time is important to understand how Americans feel about the contest. For a long time, the major feeling was exhaustion. Die-hard fans showed enthusiasm, but most of the country tried to focus on something different. Europeans, used to short election cycles, might find this strange. Think of French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s decision to dissolve parliament after the European elections\u2014you would be hard-pressed to remember the campaign. In contrast, Americans are trapped in a super marathon, grinding along until the end is in sight, which explains \u2018undecided voters\u2019. They know the candidates and which issues are important to them \u2014 health care, cost of living, education, and the changing nature of American society. They just fail to see how this long, grinding electoral process is going to generate a meaningful solution. This is why Kamala Harris sparked such enthusiasm\u2014she was new and different, alongside Tim Walz as her running mate. Together, they created new contrasts with Trump and J.D. Vance. The challenge now for both sides is proving they can solve these big, recognisable problems in ways that positively impact lives.\n\nAs Director of the Schuman Centre, what are some key issues in research related to the US elections that we should hear about?\n\nVirtually all the research we do at the Robert Schuman Centre is relevant to these elections. While not all of it will enter the popular debate, it will impact policy and, in turn, politics. Our latest \u2018Research Agenda\u2019 highlights this. The work we do on international conflict, climate change, democracy, migration, citizenship, decision-making, globalisation, technological innovation, macroeconomics, and finance sheds light on how societies function and how we can make the world a better place. This applies across disciplines, from the insights of history to the important choices explored in the study of law.\n\nOur biggest challenge is communicating this research to a broader audience\u2014showing its value and helping politicians, voters, officials, businesses, and households build on it. This is as true for the United States as it is for Europe, and as important globally as for the transatlantic partnership. This assertion is not meant as exaggeration or hyperbole. We are hardly the only outfit that works on these topics. My point is simply that the Robert Schuman Centre was created to do research that can feed into the kind of wider debates we see taking place in the context of the US elections and elsewhere.\n\nErik Jones is Director of the Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies at the European University Institute.He is editor or co-editor of books and special issues of journals on topics related to European politics and political economy.

It mostly reached partisan Republican voters \u2013 those \u201cleast likely to need influencing\u201d \u2013 and there was \u201cno evidence of a meaningful relationship between exposure (...) and changes in attitudes, polarisation, or voting behaviour.\u201d\n\nSo while it may be concerning that some overseas agents could be trying to influence US voters, their mission seems largely ineffective and journalists could do a better job of reflecting that. \u201cThere's a lot of secondary coverage of misinformation in the mainstream media that I don't think adequately characterises how little it's seen,\u201d says Allen. \u201cThere needs to just be much more careful reporting and contextualisation of efforts.\u201d\n\nBringing attention closer to home, some scholars argue that an insular right-wing arm of the domestic news ecosystem is more effective at promoting \u201cdisinformation, propaganda, and just sheer bullshit,\u201d than social media or Russian influence campaigns.\n\nThe authors of Network Propaganda, which looked at media coverage in the years either side of the 2016 election, described the US right-wing ecosystem of hyper-partisan sites as publishing \u201cdecontextualised truths, repeated falsehoods, and leaps of logic to create a fundamentally misleading view of the world.\u201d In an interview with Boston Review, lead author Yochai Benkler said: \u201cIts defining characteristic is pushing content that reinforces identity and political in-group membership.\u201d\n\nWhether or not stories are true or false is not really the point, he argues, and it's therefore operating to a different standard than the rest of the American news ecosystem which largely adheres to traditional journalistic practices and standards.\n\nDoes AI pose a new misinformation risk?\n\nThe 2024 presidential election will be the first where generative AI applications are available at scale prompting fears that it is \u201csupercharging the threat of election disinformation,\u201d where \u201canyone can create high-quality \u2018deepfakes\u2019 with just a simple text prompt,\u201d to deceive voters.\n\nA contributor to a recent podcast by the Brookings Institution said of the threat of AI: \u201cWe could end up in a situation of an election being decided [emphasis added] based on false narratives.\u201d Fears often centre around the quantity of misinformation that can be generated using AI, the increasing quality as the technology improves and the ability to create personalised misinformation targeted at recipients.\n\nIn a recent piece published by Harvard\u2019s Misinformation Review, a group of researchers including Altay and the Reuters Institute\u2019s Felix Simon argued that, overall, \u201ccurrent concerns about the effects of generative AI are overblown\u201d and in keeping with other \u201cmoral panics surrounding new technologies\u201d that emerged in the past.\n\nCould individuals be hyper-targeted with AI-generated content? Possibly, but AI-generated content doesn\u2019t distribute itself and there is little evidence from political campaigns that direct, personalised messages are very persuasive. As with the rise of existing technologies, argues Altay, AI will have \u201ca huge influence in what we do. But it doesn't mean it's going to determine who we vote for.\u201d\n\nThe US election is only one of the dozens of electoral processes taking place in 2024. During the Indian election, generative AI was used widely, often to inject an air of fun into campaigns, including by \u2018resurrecting\u2019 famous singers or cloning politicians\u2019 voices to make personalised campaign calls.\n\nConsistent with Indian politics, violent rhetoric, particularly against Muslims by Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s campaign, was in force and generated using AI. However, say Harvard Kennedy School\u2019s Vandinika Shukla and Bruce Schneier, \u201cthe harm can be traced back to the hateful rhetoric itself and not necessarily the AI tools used to spread it.\u201d\n\nThis sentiment was recently echoed by Ritu Kapur, co-founder of Indian news outlet The Quint, who said: \u201cWe didn't need AI for misinformation in the Indian elections. We have plenty coming from politicians.\u201d\n\nHow journalists unwittingly assist disinformation campaigns\n\nWhen the Department of Justice announced their indictment against Tenet Media in September, it became a major news story. It involved Russian money, a shady plot and one of the country\u2019s most popular YouTubers two months before election day. However, given the limits of the influence operation, journalists should have offered \u201cmuch more careful reporting and contextualisation,\u201d argues Allen. This often requires showing that the amounts of money involved and the overall reach were relatively small.\n\nAnother case shows how the news media\u2019s overemphasis of the scale or success of such campaigns may play into the hands of those running them.\n\nThe 2022 \u2018Doppelganger\u2019 campaign created a network of fake websites posing as real ones to push information in line with Russia\u2019s war aims. Thomas Rid, an expert in information warfare who saw leaked campaign documents, wrote: \u201cThe biggest boost the campaigners got was from the West\u2019s own anxious coverage of the project\u201d and that \u201cfar more people likely read the secondary coverage of the exposed forgery campaigns than ever viewed the primary disinformation.\u201d\n\nOne of the company\u2019s stated achievements was \u201cthe publication of a number of journalistic and industry investigations into Russian disinformation campaigns,\u201d including by Meta and the Washington Post. Mainstream media coverage of the operation was one of the goals the campaign pursued.\n\nIt\u2019s much more difficult to understand the exposure to online misinformation today than even two years ago, says Allen, who stresses that Twitter removed its free API, Facebook replaced CrowdTangle with something less useful and TikTok \u201cis not transparent\u201d about the platform. Another concern is that much of the evidence on the spread and influence of misinformation comes from Western Europe and the US, so researchers are not able to draw strong conclusions about the influence of misleading content in the Global South.\n\nWhat is lost in pointing the finger at online misinformation\n\nDespite the evidence against social media or AI-driven misinformation being persuasive enough to swing an election, this doesn\u2019t mean misinformation in general is not problematic in other ways. Frequent false claims about the reliability of the 2020 election result by Donald Trump circulated among angry crowds outside vote-counting centres and culminated in the storming of the Capitol on 6 January 2021. In this election, with a potential photo finish, genuine uncertainty around the results and possible delays in vote counting could leave space for false claims to flourish at a time when they could be most harmful.\n\nBut focusing on online misinformation as the cause of unease or even unrest can distract from larger questions as to why people accept something that isn\u2019t true or that is so at odds with prevailing beliefs. It can also let more powerful people off the hook, Altay says: \u201cThis focus on social media diverts our attention from politicians, from older institutions, or even from some media organisations that are much more powerful and influential and sometimes spread misinformation that I think is more consequential than what\u2019s spread online by regular users.\u201d\n\nAfter all, it was misinformation coming from the very top that spread the lie about the 2020 election being stolen, and even four years later the public's beliefs about the scale of election fraud are \"wildly exaggerated\". As Professor Nyhan says, \"the claim about Trump winning was of course spread widely by him and via the mainstream media.\" The extent of this misperception would have been very different if only ordinary people had shared those claims on their social media channels.\n\nAs Trump was using every channel to promote these baseless claims, \u201cpeople still would have likely learned about and believed [it] without the help of social media,\u201d Allen suggests. Would the assault on the US Capitol have happened without Trump\u2019s encouragement? The evidence suggests it\u2019s very unlikely.\n\nEvidence shows that millions of Americans hold false beliefs, including in the arena of politics. Reporters have also proved that overseas actors are trying to influence what people believe and that AI has now become a major campaigning tool in elections. But the evidence from previous elections suggests such fears about the actual impact of online misinformation are largely unwarranted, at least for now.\n\nBeing interested in the pursuit of truth inevitably means journalists are concerned when they repeatedly see misinformation themselves and they may want to sound the alarm in their coverage. But it is in large part due to the work of journalists, fact-checkers and the dominance of mainstream news outlets that online misinformation does not gain as much of a foothold as we might think. The US election might be more immune to these false narratives than many outspoken pundits say.",

Mr. S\u00e1nchez suggested that another Trump Administration could see an intensified effort to fund infrastructure, energy and technology projects in Latin America to counteract Chinese influence.\n\n\"[With Harris] there will be a continued emphasis on deploying new low-carbon energy technologies such as wind, solar and significant energy storage,\" Ms. Viola said. \"In contrast, Trump would work to repeal Joe Biden's environmental regulations on methane, the social cost of carbon and the endangered species law, which he deems too burdensome for the oil and gas industry.\"\n\n\"In the event of a second Trump term, this approach could intensify with greater investment in infrastructure, energy and technology projects in the region, especially those aimed at reducing dependence on Chinese investment,\" Mr. S\u00e1nchez said.\n\nREAD: The Direction of the U.S. Energy Transition Could Change After the Election",

        "text": "Market Perspectives\nChicago Board of Trade Market News\n\nOutlook\n\nUncertainty about the upcoming U.S. presidential election results is having some impacts on not only U.S. commodity markets but also world commodity markets. The political rhetoric includes threats of actions such as tariffs that could become disruptive to corn and soybean flows from the U.S. if countries affected were to take retaliatory actions. Campaign speeches appear to be prompting some importers to speed up the time frame for grain shipments and have U.S. grain merchandizers scrambling to ship out as much corn and soybeans from the record 2024 U.S. crop ahead of the presidential elections, and for sure, ahead of the inauguration of the next president in January. Nearly 2.5 mmt of U.S. soybeans were inspected for export last week, including 1.7 mmt bound for China. This is the highest level of weekly export inspections in the past year.\n\nNearly 1 mmt of corn were inspected for export last week also. This compares to 506.6 tmt last week and 472.4 tmt of corn exports in the corresponding week a year ago. To date in the current marketing year, corn export inspections are 5.79 mmt compared to 4.44 mmt a year earlier. That is a 30% increase. This \u201cpull forward\u201d of export shipments is likely to last at least through the election, which is in two weeks, and could extend into January if Donald Trump is elected president. If Kamala Harris wins the election, the rush to move exports before inauguration day in late January could ease up.\n\nChinese buyers of grain appear to be reluctant to book U.S. grains and oilseeds for shipments beyond January. Instead, these buyers are booking Brazilian soybeans and paying up to a 40-cent premium for those soybeans, compared to what they could book U.S. soybeans for that time period of delivery. At least one analyst believes this pull-forward and then fall-off in export shipments could result in U.S. soybean exports falling short of the latest USDA soybean export estimate.\n\nCurrent shipments of corn are also strong with Mexico being the number one destination of corn exports from the U.S. Earlier this week, private exporters reported 359 tmt of corn sold to Mexico for delivery in the 2024/25 marketing year and another 100 tmt to unknown destinations. And over the past week there were export sales of 169 tmt of corn to Mexico, 130 tmt to South Korea, and 198 tmt of corn to unknown destinations.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) lowered their 2025 global GDP forecast amid what they deem to be increasing risks of slower economic growth. They cite geopolitical risk with increased potential of regional conflicts that could affect commodity markets. These risks include a rise in protectionism rhetoric, protectionist trade policies, and disruptions to trade directly resulting from some of the regional conflicts (ships being targeted in military actions, pirate attacks, etc.). The IMF\u2019s forecast is for 3.2% global growth, down 0.1% from last year. U.S. economic growth was raised to 2.8%; Eurozone economic growth is forecast at 0.8% this year and 1.2% in 2025. Japan\u2019s economy is forecast to slow to 0.3% growth this year but improve to 1.1% growth in 2025. China\u2019s economy is expected to slow to 4.8% this year and further slow to 4.2% growth in 2025. India\u2019s economy is expected to moderate from 8.2% growth in 2023 to 7% in 2024 and further moderate to 6.5% growth in 2025. Slower growth could keep commodity prices under pressure, at least in the near term.\n\nThe U.S. corn harvest was 65% complete at the end of last week and should be 80-85% complete by the end of October. Harvest pressure should abate in November and basis levels in the U.S. stabilize.",

Which states were they, and what do we know about them?\n\nThe United States is made up of 50 states, but when it comes to presidential elections, some states matter more than others.\n\nThough \"safe states\" reliably vote for one party or the other, \"swing states\" are often a toss-up between the Democratic and Republican candidate and, with 10-19 Electoral College votes per state, they are particularly attractive to campaigns.\n\nAs the US president and vice president aren't elected directly by voters through the national popular vote, swing states are put under the polling microscope, host high-profile rallies, receive numerous visits from candidates and are inundated by party ads targeting undecided voters.\n\nThis complex and controversial process has recently meant that the winner of the popular vote could fail to win the Electoral College, and thus the presidency. This happened in 2000 when George W. Bush beat Al Gore, and in 2016 when Donald Trump was chosen over Hillary Clinton.\n\nWhich states are swing states?\n\nOver the years, the list of swing states has changed because of population growth and shifting demographics. Still, for US voters, the economy and inflation are at the top of the list of important issues.\n\nStances on abortion rights will play an important role in voter turnout across the country. Besides these topics, each swing state has its own set of key issues.\n\nYou can find the latest results in DW's election live blog.\n\nArizona\n\nArizona shares a long border with Mexico.\n\nAs vice president, Kamala Harris was given the job of reducing the number of people attempting to cross the US's southern border by tackling the \"root causes\" of emigration from Latin America. Her Republican opponent in the 2024 election campaign, former US President Donald Trump, and his supporters say she failed at this task.\n\nTo boost its economy, Arizona is beefing up its manufacturing sector. The CHIPS Act, a law introduced by President Joe Biden, is helping fund billions for computer chip plants, but it will be a while until these new facilities are up and running.\n\nBiden won the state in 2020.\n\nElectoral votes: 11\n\nGeorgia\n\nIn 2020, Biden became the first Democrat to win Georgia's electoral votes since Bill Clinton in 1992. But with a margin of 0.2 percentage points, it was an incredibly tight race.\n\nAbout 33% of the state's voters are Black, one of highest proportions in the country \u2014 a fact that may come in handy for Harris.\n\nGeorgia is also the state where a grand jury indicted Trump and 18 others on charges related to illegally trying to overturn the 2020 presidential election. That case has stalled and won't go to trial before the current election.\n\nElectoral votes: 16\n\nUpdate: Donald Trump has won the second battleground state of Georgia, according to AP and US media broadcasters.\n\nA candidate needs 270 electoral votes out of 538 to win. Among all seven swing states, Pennsylvania, which Kamala Harris has frequently visited this campaign, has the most electoral votes Image: Kevin Lamarque/REUTERS\n\nMichigan\n\nIt's nearly impossible to think of Michigan without the auto industry. The state is home to Ford, General Motors and Chrysler, now part of Stellantis. These manufacturing jobs are important to the region. An invasion of competitive Chinese electric vehicles was recently stopped in its tracks by massive tariffs introduced by Biden.\n\nThe state is also home to Gretchen Whitmer, a popular Democratic governor who has long been a thorn in the side of Republicans.\n\nYet, in the February presidential primaries more than 101,000 voters chose the \"uncommitted\" option to show their frustration with Biden during the war in Gaza. Now that he has been replaced, Harris needs to secure their backing.\n\nHarris will also need to win over Michigan's large pool of Arab American voters. Their support of the Democrats has been in jeopardy because of the party's backing of Israel in its war against Hamas in Gaza.\n\nBiden won the state in 2020.\n\nElectoral votes: 15\n\nUS election 2024: Will Kamala Harris win over Muslim voters?

The population is nearly one-third Hispanic.\n\nNevada state is heavily dependent on tourism, and its economy has grown more than that of any other swing state since Biden took office. At the same time, it has the highest unemployment rate of any state in the country.\n\nBiden won the state in 2020.\n\nElectoral votes: 6\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nNorth Carolina is the latest to join the list of swing states. Before Biden dropped out of the race in July, Trump had a big lead here. Harris managed to bring that to a near tie. Yet Democratic presidential candidates have only taken the state one time in the past 11 elections.\n\nThe state has seen big demographic changes and gone from 75% white in 1990 to about 60% today. Over the last 30 years, the total population has increased significantly. The state has attracted a wide range of people, from military veterans and retirees to young college grads.\n\nTrump won the state in 2020.\n\nElectoral votes: 16\n\nUpdate: Donald Trump has won the battleground state of North Carolina. It was the first of seven to announce a winner.\n\nNorth Carolina's electoral votes go to Donald Trump. It was the first battleground state to announce a winner Image: George Walker IV/AP Photo/picture alliance\n\nPennsylvania\n\nFracking has made Pennsylvania the country's second-biggest natural gas producer, after Texas. Trump has long promoted fracking. Harris previously called for a ban but she is now keeping options open, albeit with stricter regulations.\n\nPennsylvania also hosted the only debate between Harris and Trump, on September 10.\n\nBiden won the state in 2020.\n\nElectoral votes: 19\n\nUpdate: Donald Trump has won the battleground state of Pennsylvania, according to AP and other US media.\n\nWisconsin\n\nIn Wisconsin, white people make up a higher percentage of the electorate than in any other swing state.\n\nIn the past two presidential elections, Wisconsin had one of the highest voter turnout rates in the country.Residents were able to pick the winning presidential candidate in both 2016 and 2020 by a margin of fewer than 25,000 votes each time, showing just how important each vote can be in a swing state.\n\nBiden won the state in 2020.\n\nElectoral votes: 10\n\nUpdate: Donald Trump has won the battleground state of Wisconsin, according to AP and other US media.\n\nThis article was originally published on October 24 and updated after polls closed on November 6.\n\nEdited by: Martin Kuebler",

        "text": "2024 US Presidential Election: Shaping AI regulation and ESG policies\nLegal Telescope: The AI-ESG nexus \u2013 redefining legal and regulatory strategies\n\nWith one presidential candidate more inclined toward robust regulation and the other more inclined to loosen regulatory requirements, the outcome of the 2024 US election will significantly influence the direction of AI governance and ESG disclosure requirements at the federal level, with profound implications both domestically and globally.\n\nShaping AI Regulation and Governance\n\nAs AI\u2019s promise of revolutionary opportunities runs up against warnings of revolutionary risk, Congress has deadlocked on whether to foster a rapid and relatively unhindered pursuit of opportunity, especially in the face of competition from countries like China, or whether to move slower and break fewer things.\n\nThe current administration has met this legislative deadlock through both executive orders and sometimes aggressive interpretation of existing statutory authority, addressing key issues such as data privacy, algorithmic transparency and the ethical use of AI. If Vice President Harris becomes president, we can expect continued executive action prioritizing risk mitigation, as well as calls for Congress to enshrine a more cautious approach in law, including through measures to prevent bias in AI systems, enforce transparency in AI decision making processes and safeguard personal data.\n\nIf former President Trump returns to the Oval Office, we can expect executive action to minimize regulatory burdens and prioritize innovation, particularly in the name of global competition. That could include repeal of President Biden\u2019s executive orders on AI and greater investment in military AI capabilities.\n\nRegardless of the presidential election, states are likely to fill the void, leading to a disparate patchwork of laws - and perhaps even more piecemeal than in the data privacy context, as states seek to tackle particular uses of AI, such as algorithmic underwriting, or to protect specific populations, such as children.\n\nImpact on ESG Policies\n\nThe election will also have a significant impact on ESG policies, which have gained increasing importance among investors and stakeholders. The direction of ESG policy and disclosure requirements will depend on the administration\u2019s stance on sustainability and corporate responsibility.\n\nAn administration committed to sustainability and social equity may introduce stricter ESG reporting standards. This could involve mandating greater transparency on issues such as carbon emissions, labor practices and board diversity. Enhanced disclosure requirements would push companies to adopt more sustainable and socially responsible practices, aligning with global ESG trends.\n\nConversely, an administration focused on economic growth and deregulation might relax ESG disclosure requirements. This could slow the momentum of ESG initiatives, potentially reducing the emphasis on sustainability and social responsibility in corporate strategies. The divergence in policy direction will influence how companies approach ESG issues and shape their long-term strategies.\n\nEnergy policies will also be a critical factor, as they directly impact ESG developments. The election outcome could determine the level of commitment to renewable energy, climate change mitigation, and clean energy transition. An administration prioritizing clean energy initiatives could accelerate the shift towards sustainable energy sources, influencing global energy markets and encouraging other nations to follow suit, but doing so may impose costs in the energy sector and beyond.\n\nThe 2024 US presidential election is poised to shape the future of both AI regulation and ESG policies. The direction of AI governance will depend on the administration\u2019s approach to balancing innovation and regulation, while ESG policies will reflect the government\u2019s commitment to sustainability and corporate responsibility. On both fronts, the election\u2019s outcome will also set the tone for international standards and cooperation, underscoring the interconnectedness of these critical issues.\n\n[View source.]",

Weber, Ph.D., Releases List of Presidential Write-in Candidates for November 5, 2024, General Election\n\nSacramento, Calif. \u2013 California Secretary of State Shirley N. Weber, Ph.D., has released the certified the list of Presidential write-in candidates for the November 5, 2024, General Election.\n\nThe certified list of write-in candidates is available online at: elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov//statewide-elections/2024-general/write-in-president.pdf.\n\nWhen will the Secretary of State\u2019s office have vote counts for the certified write-in candidates?\n\nCounty elections officials count votes for write-in candidates during the post-election canvass period. Please note that ballots with write-in candidates take longer to count. Results for write-in candidates are not transmitted to the Secretary of State\u2019s office until counties do their final certification of the vote; therefore, the results for write-in candidates will not be included on the election night results website. The results for write-in presidential candidates and all other write-in candidates will be published on December 13, 2024, according to state law.\n\nDo voters have to write a certified write-in candidate\u2019s name exactly? Does spelling count?\n\nCounty elections officials will accept a reasonable facsimile of the spelling of a candidate\u2019s name. Example: votes for \u201cJoe Smith\u201d and \u201cJoseph Smith\u201d would be accepted for \u201cJoseph A. Smith.\u201d\n\nWhere can voters find the list of certified write-in candidates?\n\nThe list of certified write-in candidates is posted on the Secretary of State\u2019s website, and county elections officials will post the list in polling locations and voter centers.\n\n###",

        "text": "North Carolina swing state profile\nA quick guide to swing state North Carolina\n\nBBC\n\nNorth Carolina, famous for Michael Jordan, Krispy Kreme and the world\u2019s first flight in a powered aircraft, is one of seven states that will decide the 2024 US presidential election. Voting in swing states is hard to predict and can swing Republican or Democrat - that\u2019s why you\u2019re hearing so much about them as campaigning draws to a close. Here\u2019s all you need to know.\n\nPopulation\n\n10.7m, same as Honduras\n\nElectoral college votes\n\n16 of 538\n\nIn a nutshell\n\nIt\u2019s the only battleground state that Donald Trump won in 2020 so if Democrats were to flip it, his task becomes a lot harder.\n\n2020 margin\n\nTrump by 74,000 votes.\n\nWhat's the deal now?\n\nNorth Carolina is faithfully Republica, but Democrats almost won it in 2020 partly because of the state\u2019s black voters, a group they have heavily targeted again this year.\n\nWhat do voters say?\n\nDemocrats in North Carolina are excited to have Harris as their presidential nominee, the first black and south-east Asian woman in the role. \u201cEverybody is energised and feels like we have a good chance,\u201d says Michael Sutton, 70. William Overton, 85, is frustrated that abortion laws today \u201care worse than the 1950s\u201d. Republicans say their top issues are the economy and inflation, followed by immigration. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen the past four years is terrible,\u201d says Zena Rose, a small business owner in Johnston County.\n\nExpert view\n\nFor Democrats to win North Carolina, they will need high turnout from the state\u2019s black voters, says Michael Bitzer, chair of the Catawba University Department of Politics, especially in the state\u2019s more populous metros like Raleigh and Charlotte, and in the eastern rural parts of the state. Another key group Democrats need to see in high numbers are voters under the age of 43 - which Mr Bitzer says compose 42% of all registered North Carolina voters. For Republicans to win, they need their party\u2019s voters to continue registering at higher rates and voting in larger numbers than Democrats. Two things might challenge that, Mr Bitzer says. One factor is whether the 250,000 moderate Republicans who voted for Nikki Haley in the primary support Harris or choose not to vote. The second factor is Hurricane Helene, which destroyed much of the western part of the state in predominantly Republican areas.\n\nWhat to watch out for on election night",

        "text": "Early voting for 2024 election underway in dozens of states with millions of ballots cast so far\nWashington \u2014 With early voting underway in all seven battleground states and in another three dozen states, millions of Americans have cast their ballots already.\n\nMore than 32 million people have voted early so far, according to data from the University of Florida's Election Lab, with the most voting by mail. Democrats are outpacing Republicans in casting their ballots early, data from 25 states that report party registration shows.\n\nMore Republicans have cast roughly 452,000 more ballots in person so far, while more Democrats have returned 1.3 million more mail ballots than registered GOP voters, according to the Election Lab.\n\nRecord number of ballots cast in some states\n\nThe high numbers of voters casting their ballots before Election Day on Nov. 5 has set records in at least two battleground states, North Carolina and Georgia. In Georgia, which President Biden won in 2020, more than 25% of active voters have already cast their ballots, according to Gabe Sterling, chief operating officer for secretary of state.\n\nAnd in North Carolina, where the western part of the state was devastated by Hurricane Helene, more than 353,000 people voted on the first day of the state's early-voting period, which was Oct. 17. That figure surpassed the prior record for the opening day of early voting: more than 348,000 in 2020, according to the North Carolina State Board of Elections.\n\nBoth surpassed the mark of 2 million votes cast Wednesday. Early voting in Georgia lasts until Nov. 1, and in-person early voting runs until Nov. 2 in North Carolina.\n\nIn Nevada, another battleground state, more than 397,000 voters had cast ballots as of Tuesday, with 40% from registered Republicans, according to the secretary of state.\n\nDavid Becker, a CBS News election law contributor and the executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, cautioned that the breakdown of early voting by party does not portend the outcome of the election.\n\nStates report party registration data, and a voters' political affiliation may not correspond with the candidate who won their vote.\n\n\"We won't know until the votes get counted,\" Becker said.\n\nStill, he said that the more early voting there is, the better it is for election administration and security. Those who have already cast their ballots no longer risk standing in long lines on Election Day or getting to their polling place after it's closed, and they won't be subject to disinformation that could impact their vote.\n\n2020 early voting\n\nDuring the 2020 election, nearly 60 million people cast a ballot by Oct. 25, according to the U.S. Elections Project, run by Michael McDonald, a political science professor at the University of Florida who also runs the Election Lab. Democrats doubled the number of Republicans who returned mail ballots by that point in early voting, while Republicans had a slight edge over their Democratic counterparts in voting early in-person.\n\nBut 2020 was a \"unicorn election,\" Becker said, as the COVID-19 pandemic led to higher numbers of people voting by mail and states sought to make it easier for them to do so. And former President Donald Trump spent the months leading up to the last presidential contest falsely claiming that mail-in voting was fraudulent, \"corrupt\" and \"horrible.\"\n\nStill, in the years before the 2020 contest, more and more states were offering voters the chance to vote early, either by mail or in person. In the 2000 general election, 24 states had early-voting options, and that number jumped to 28 in the 2008 election, and 31 states and the District of Columbia by 2016, according to an analysis from the Center for Election Innovation and research. For the 2024 election, 47 states give voters ways to cast ballots before Election Day.\n\nAnd over the last five election cycles before 2020, the share of ballots cast early steadily rose: from 14% in 2000, to 21% in 2004, 31% in 2008, 33% in 2012 and 40% in 2016, the Center for Election Innovation and Research found.\n\nTrump's shift on early voting\n\nWhile Trump has for this year's presidential election continued his crusade against mail-in and early voting at times, he has urged supporters to cast their ballots early in other instances. During a Pennsylvania rally in September, he called the ability to vote before the election \"stupid\" and claimed it invited fraud.\n\nBut in a radio interview with Fox News host Brian Kilmeade that aired Wednesday, he urged his supporters to cast their ballots early and even suggested he would do the same in Florida.\n\n\"I have the old standard of the Tuesday vote and all. A lot of people like to vote, and I really miss you know, the main thing to me is you've got to vote. You got to vote,\" he said. \"Voting early, I guess, would be good. But you know, people \u2014 I'll have different feelings about it. But the main thing is you got to get out. You got to vote. And I'll be voting early. I'll be running early.\"\n\nIn a June video for the Republican National Committee, Trump said GOP voters must use \"every appropriate tool available\" to beat Democrats, whether early, absentee, by mail or in-person.\n\nThe RNC has been working to encourage voters to bank their votes by voting as early as possible through absentee voting, in-person voting and ballot harvesting where it's allowed.\n\n\"We want you to bank your vote. We don't want you to have to worry about waiting in super long lines on Election Day,\" Lara Trump, co-chair of the Republican National Committee and the former president's daughter-in-law, said during an interview Sunday with Fox News.",

I would always accept it if it\u2019s a fair election,\u201d Trump said.\n\nSpeaker of the House Mike Johnson also offered a conditional response when reporters asked him less than a month ago if he would commit to observing regular order in the electoral certification process in January 2025.\n\n\u201cWell of course, if we have a free, fair and safe election, we\u2019re going to follow the Constitution. Absolutely, yes,\u201d Johnson.\n\nNBC\u2019s Kristen Welker pressed Johnson again on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d in mid-October \u2014 she asked if he would certify the election \u201cregardless of who wins.\u201d\n\n\u201cRegardless? Yes, if the election is a free and fair election, and we pray and hope that it is. There\u2019s a lot of work being done to make sure that\u2019s true. I think this one will be so large there will be no question, and I think Donald Trump is your next president,\u201d he said.\n\nJohnson\u2019s repeated insistence that he would perform his constitutional duty only if he deems the election \u201cfree and fair\u201d has alarmed Democrats and many experts, given Johnson\u2019s clear allegiance to the lie that the 2020 election that Donald Trump lost was neither free nor fair.\n\nJohnson adamantly promoted Trump\u2019s baseless voter fraud claims in 2020. He asked 105 Republicans to sign on to a letter of support to the Supreme Court for a lawsuit filed in Texas that year seeking to delay the certification of electoral results in battleground states even after it was established that Trump\u2019s claims of fraud were bunk.\n\nThat was when Johnson was a junior Republican, unheard of to most Americans. Now he is the speaker of the House. These days, he is once again fearmongering about the fairness of presidential elections. He has suggested, contrary to any evidence, that there will be fraud in 2024 due to huge swaths of undocumented immigrants casting ballots.\n\nAnd, if Republicans retain control of the lower chamber after this election and Johnson can hold onto the speakership, the Trump ally will be remarkably well-positioned to advance any agenda Trump and his allies in Congress share.",

Does our faith compel us to vote for a particular candidate? What does it mean to have a \u201cwell-formed conscience\u201d? What issues, policies, values, and principles should guide our engagement in political life? Held less than two weeks before the U.S. presidential election, this dialogue with four leaders explored our responsibilities as voters with values in the face of a deeply polarized political landscape that faces threats to U.S. democratic norms and institutions.\n\n",

The political gender gap reflects a decade of social upheaval and could help decide the US election. For the first woman of colour to secure a presidential nomination, and only the second woman to ever get this close, Kamala Harris goes to great lengths not to talk about her identity. \u201cListen, I am running because I believe that I am the best person to do this job at this moment for all Americans, regardless of race and gender,\u201d the vice-president said in a CNN interview last month. And yet, despite all her efforts to neutralise the subject, gender is shaping up to be the defining issue of this campaign. \u201cMadame President\u201d would be a new thing for America and it\u2019s reasonable to assume that while many voters love the idea, some find the novelty a little unnerving. The Harris campaign won\u2019t say it publicly, but one official acknowledged to me recently that they do believe there is \u201chidden sexism\u201d here that will deter some people from voting for any woman for president. It\u2019s 2024 and few people want to be the jerk who\u2019ll tell a pollster outright that they don\u2019t think a woman is fit for the Oval Office (though plenty are prepared to share misogynistic memes on social media). A Democratic strategist suggested there\u2019s a code, when voters tell pollsters that Harris is not \u201cready\u201d or doesn't have the right \u201cpersonality\u201d or \u201cwhat it takes,\u201d what they really mean is that the problem is she\u2019s a woman.\n\nGetty Images Congresswoman Liz Cheney, who has called Trump \"misogynistic\", has been helping Harris pitch herself to Republican women\n\nThe Trump campaign says gender has nothing to do with it. \u201cKamala is weak, dishonest, and dangerously liberal, and that\u2019s why the American people will reject her on November 5th,\u201d it said this week. Although Bryan Lanza, a senior adviser to the campaign, texted me to say he\u2019s confident Trump will win because \u201cthe male gender gap gives us the edge\u201d. Last time a woman ran for president, negative attitudes to her gender were clearly a factor. Eight years ago Hillary Clinton touted her being the first female nominee of a major party. The campaign\u2019s slogan \u201cI\u2019m with Her\u201d was a not very subtle reminder of her trailblazing role. Pennsylvania Congresswoman Madeleine Dean remembers discussing Clinton\u2019s candidacy with voters. I spent an afternoon with Dean as she campaigned in her district this week and she told me that back in 2016 people would tell her, \u2018There\u2019s just something about her.\u2019 She says she soon realised that \u201cIt was about the \u2018her.\u2019 That was a thing. It was that [Hillary] was a woman.\u201d While Dean thinks that sentiment is less prevalent today, she acknowledges that even now, \u201cthere are certain people who just think \u2018A powerful woman? No, a bridge too far.\u2019\u201d A lot has changed for women since 2016. The #MeToo movement in 2017 increased awareness of the subtle - and the not so subtle - discriminations women face at work. It changed the way we talk about women as professionals. MeToo may have made it easier for a candidate like Harris to secure the nomination. But those big steps forward on the issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion were interpreted by some as a step back, especially for young men who felt they\u2019d been left behind. Or the changes were simply a step too far for conservative Americans who prefer more traditional gender roles. A gender gap has opened in the race, CBS News poll results released Sunday indicate, reflecting broader attitudes in the US about societal roles. CBS, the BBC's US news partner, reported that men are more likely to say efforts to promote gender equality in the US have gone too far; they are more likely to be Trump supporters. Women are more likely to say those efforts haven't been enough - and they tend to support Harris. Men also are less likely than women to think Harris will be a strong leader, CBS reported, and a majority of men say they think Trump will be a strong leader. So for some voters, this November\u2019s election has turned into a referendum on gender norms, and the social upheavals of recent years. This seems particularly true for the voters Kamala Harris has a tough time reaching: the young men who live in a world that is rapidly changing for, well, young men. \u201cYoung men often feel like if they ask questions they are labeled as misogynist, homophobic or racist,\u201d says John Della Volpe, director of polling at the Harvard Institute of Politics. \u201cFrustrated at not feeling understood, many then get sucked into a bro-culture of Donald Trump or Elon Musk. They look at who the Democrats prioritise - women, abortion rights, LGTBQ culture - and they ask \u2018what about us?\u2019\u201d\n\nDella Volpe specialises in polling younger voters. He says the young men he is referring to are not part of some radical alt right, incel cabal. They are your sons, or they\u2019re your neighbour\u2019s sons. Indeed, he says, many support equality for women, but they also feel their own concerns go unheard. Della Volpe ticks through a list of statistics showing ways young men today are worse off than their female counterparts: they are less likely to be in relationships, they are less likely to enrol in college than they used to, they have higher rates of suicide than their female peers. Young American women meanwhile are steaming ahead. They are better educated than men, they work in service industries that are growing and increasingly they are earning more than men. In the period since Donald Trump was elected president, young women have also become significantly more liberal than young men, according to the Gallup polling group. Which is all creating a stark gender split. Over the last seven years, the share of young men who say the US has gone \u201ctoo far\u201d promoting gender equality has more than doubled, according to the American Enterprise Institute.\n\nGetty Images Trump has been courting young male voters by embracing locker room talk and attending Ultimate Fighting Championship events",

(From AFP)\nDonald Trump has vowed to eliminate U.S. President Joe Biden's climate subsidies if he wins the election. However, many of Trump\u2019s allies are currently reaping the benefits of these subsidies through substantial investments in clean energy sectors, including solar power, electric vehicles, carbon sequestration, hydrogen, and other technologies.Reuters discovered that at least seven of Trump\u2019s close associates and fundraisers, or the companies they manage, possess stakes worth hundreds of millions of dollars in businesses that significantly benefit from the tax incentives included in the Inflation Reduction Act, which is Biden's flagship climate legislation. (Reuters)\nThe $28 trillion Treasury market is considered one of the most essential financial markets globally. It serves as the platform where the U.S. government sells its debt to investors, who then buy and trade that debt, impacting borrowing costs worldwide. This market has also become a key area for investors to voice their opinions on the presidential race.Both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have proposed tax and spending policies likely to increase federal deficits, resulting in higher government borrowing.However, investors are particularly focused on Trump's proposals, which include significant tariffs and substantial tax cuts, especially as his chances of winning have improved in some betting markets.Economists have predicted that his policies could lead to an additional $7.5 trillion in U.S. Treasury debt over the next decade, a figure that is more than double the estimate for Harris' policies from a nonpartisan group.

The poll shows Trump with 47 per cent to 45 per cent edge over Kamala Harris, an advantage that comes within the survey's margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points.In the paper's iteration of the poll conducted in August, Harris had a 2 point advantage, which was within the margin of error, according to Politico report.The presidential nominees of Republican party and Democratic party are not only neck and neck nationally. But, also in the swing states that will ultimately decide the winner of the Electoral College.A poll conducted by Washington Post of those states released on Monday revealed Trump and Harris each with narrow leads within margin of error, Politico reported.The poll conducted by The Wall Street Journal surveyed 1,500 registered voters between October 19-22.

(From NYT)03:38:57 PM IST, 25 Oct 2024US Election 2024 Live Updates: Why we may not know the US presidential election race winner on November 5The U.S. presidential election will take place on Nov. 5, but the winner of the razor-thin race between Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump may not be known for days after the polls close.As ballots are counted, one candidate may appear to be leading based on early returns, only for a rival to close the gap as more votes are tallied.In 2020, some states experienced a \"red mirage,\" in which Trump was leading on election night, before a \"blue shift\" saw Democrat Joe Biden overtake him, a phenomenon Trump used to amplify his false claims that the election was stolen.Nothing untoward had occurred. Democrats tend to live in more populous urban areas, where counting votes takes longer. Democrats also have embraced mail voting more readily than Republicans after Trump's false claims that mail ballots are untrustworthy, and those ballots take longer to count than Election Day votes. Trump has both encouraged and criticized early and mail-in voting in 2024.12:46:17 AM IST, 26 Oct 2024US Election 2024 Live Updates: New poll survey discover Trump and Harris are...Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump are tied at 48% each for the popular vote for the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election, according to the final New York Times/Siena College national poll published on Friday.12:57:48 PM IST, 25 Oct 2024US Election 2024 Live Updates: India's IT sector to take a hit if Trump returns?US Election 2024 Live Updates: As the U.S. election date approaches, investors worldwide are closely monitoring the outcome of the vote in the world's oldest democracy. The results could also impact India's economy, particularly if the leadership changes its approach to economic policies affecting the country.According to a report by PhillipCapital, a Trump victory could lead to stricter work visa policies due to his firm stance on immigration, posing challenges for Indian IT firms.11:47:52 AM IST, 25 Oct 2024US Election 2024 Live Updates: Kamala Harris making a mistake as she focuses on winnin Republicans?US Election 2024 Live Updates: Progressive Democrats warn Kamala Harris risks losing the support of a small but significant portion of her political base unless she changes her campaign's closing message - and its messengers - immediately. Specifically, several progressive leaders believe that the Democratic nominee has been too focused on winning over moderate Republicans in recent days at the expense of her own party's passionate liberals.10:08:42 AM IST, 25 Oct 2024US Election 2024 Live Updates: Donald Trump attacks Kamala HarrisUS Election 2024 Live Updates: Donald Trump said Thursday that China's leader would handle Vice President Kamala Harris \"like a baby\" if she's elected to the White House, as the former president and his top allies increasingly have moved to infantilise the Democratic nominee. \"If somehow Kamala wins, she'd have to deal with Xi Jinping,\" conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt said of the Chinese president. \"How would he handle her?\"08:24:15 AM IST, 25 Oct 2024US Election 2024 Live Updates: Beyonce likely to join campaign for Kamala HarrisUS Election 2024 Live Updates: Pop icon Beyonce is expected to appear with presidential candidate Kamala Harris at a rally in Houston on Friday.The event will also see Beyonce joined by her mother, Tina Knowles, and country music's Willie Nelson, as per The Hollywood Reporter.At the onset of Harris' campaign, Beyonce had reportedly granted Vice President Harris approval to use the Lemonade song, \"Freedom.\" The song, which champions Black women's empowerment, has since become an anthem for Harris' 2024 campaign.08:19:24 AM IST, 25 Oct 2024US Election 2024 Live Updates: Who is leading and who is behind?

        "text": "Colorado voters weigh Gaza policies, eye third-party protest for presidential race\nEarly voting has already begun in Colorado, but some still aren't sure about who to support for president because of their stance on Gaza.\n\nEsa Galloway isn't sure which candidate for president he likes better.\n\n\"I can't bring myself to vote for Harris because she's part of an administration that is allowed what I see as a genocide happening, and then Trump also is advocating to do more, if not the same,\" said Galloway.\n\nThe issue of Gaza and the U.S. backing of Israel in the region is weighing on a lot of voters' minds, like Esa Galloway, ahead of the 2024 presidential election. CBS\n\nHis top issue in this election is the war in Gaza and he says neither candidate has won his vote.\n\nSo, he started a campaign called \"Vote Blue Except You Know Who\" as a way for voters to protest with their vote.\n\n\"My thinking is, vote third party at the POTUS level, and then vote for Democrats down-ballot to try to give a potential Trump presidency as much opposition as possible,\" said Galloway.\n\nLots of people who feel strongly about the war in Gaza are planning to protest vote by voting third party. It's an issue Vice President Kamala Harris addressed at a recent CNN town hall. She says she hopes voters will vote for her despite their stance on Gaza.\n\nPro-Palestinian demonstrators march on the first anniversary of the Hamas-led surprise attack on Israel, on October 7, 2024, in Denver, Colorado. The attack resulted in 251 kidnappings and 1,206 deaths of Israelis and other nationals and plunged the region into a war that has killed nearly 42,000 Palestinians. JASON CONNOLLY/AFP via Getty Images\n\n\"I also do know that for many people who care about this issue, they also care about bringing down the price of groceries. They also care about our democracy and not having a President of United States who admires dictators and is a fascist,\" said Harris on CNN.\n\nCBS News Colorado asked the Harris campaign for a response, and they sent this:\n\n\"The Vice President is committed to work to earn every vote, unite our country, and to be a president for all Americans. Throughout her career, Vice President Harris has been steadfast in her support of our country's diverse Muslim community, including ensuring that they can live free from the hateful policies of the Trump administration. She will continue working to bring the war in Gaza to an end in a way where Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom and self-determination. She is also working to address the suffering in Lebanon and bring about a diplomatic solution and ensure de-escalation and stability in Lebanon and the region.\"\n\n-Nasrina Bargzie, Director of Muslim and Arab American Outreach for Harris Campaign.\n\nThey also sent a statement from the vice president that says;\n\n\"This moment gives us an opportunity to finally end the war in Gaza, and it must end such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom, and self-determination. And it is time for the day after to begin without Hamas in power.\"\n\nTrump has previously made comments about the war saying Israel should end the war quickly.\n\nThis weekend, he brought several local Muslim leaders on stage in Michigan at a rally as he works to shore up support.\n\nRobert Preuhs, professor and chair of political science at Metropolitan State University of Denver says a protest vote may hurt the Gaza cause.\n\n\"In the big picture, the Palestine-Israel conflict is pretty low on, the voters' minds,\" said Preuhs. \"It doesn't make a lot of sense, to sacrifice, say, the potential for a Trump victory over Harris, which may not be that much better, but seems to be a little bit better for folks in Palestine.\"\n\nHe says protest voting likely won't sway the election in Colorado but says the state where this is most likely to affect the election outcome is Michigan, which has a large Arab and Muslim population. Galloway says even he will be surprised if it does.\n\nGalloway's decision to vote third party is about more than politics: \"I want to be able to stand before God when I meet my maker and say 'I did what I could to oppose the wholesale slaughter of women and children.'\"",

        "text": "Trump and Harris head to battleground Michigan for campaign events\n\u200b\n\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams told reporters Saturday that he does not believe former President Trump is a fascist, while defending the Republican presidential nominee the day before a major rally at Madison Square Garden.\n\nAdams and other city leaders held a press conference at the New Yew City Police Department headquarters on Saturday afternoon to discuss security measures before the campaign rally in Manhattan.\n\nDuring the press conference, a reporter asked Adams if he believed Trump is a fascist, as others have said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard those terms hurled at me by some political leaders in the city, using terms like Hitler and fascist,\u201d Adams said. \u201cMy answer is no. I know what Hitler has done and I know what a fascist regime looks like.\u201d\n\nHe suggested everyone dial down the temperature, adding he strongly disagrees with those who say Trump should not be allowed to have a rally at Madison Square Garden.\n\n\u201cThis is America. This is New York, and I think it\u2019s important that we allow individuals to exercise their right to get their message clear to New Yorkers,\u201d Adams said. \u201cOur job as a city and as a police department is to make sure they can do that in a peaceful way.\n\n\u201cWhen people called me a fascist and other terminologies, I didn\u2019t like it and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fitting to anyone to state that the former president is equal to being Hitler,\u201d he added.",
