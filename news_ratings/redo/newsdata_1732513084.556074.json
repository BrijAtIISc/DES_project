        "text": "A brief history of presidential primaries\nOn Tuesday, March 5, voters in 15 states will play a major role in selecting the two major party candidates in this year\u2019s presidential election. The Super Tuesday primaries represent an evolution from a system that once relied on congressional caucuses and nomination conventions to choose candidates.\n\nIt is widely expected that the current president, Joseph Biden, and the former president, Donald Trump, will face off in the November 2024 presidential election. While it is not uncommon for two candidates in a presidential election to eventually serve in the White House, it is rare for two candidates who have already served as president to contest the office in the same election.\n\nIn 1912, former President Theodore Roosevelt ran as a third-party candidate against incumbent President William Howard Taft and New Jersey Gov. Woodrow Wilson. Roosevelt lost but came in second in the contest. In 1892, former president Grover Cleveland defeated incumbent President Benjamin Harrison, to whom Cleveland lost in the 1888 election.\n\nIn those two instances, presidential candidates were selected in a much different process than today\u2019s primary system.\n\nCaucuses and Conventions\n\nIn the period after the Constitution\u2019s ratification, a convention of state delegates chose electors to represent their interests in the Electoral College. The top two vote getters in the Electoral College became president and vice president. (The Constitution didn\u2019t establish procedures beyond that for the nomination of presidential candidates.) The system worked for America\u2019s first two elections when George Washington was the unanimous choice for president; but it quickly fell apart when political parties formed after Washington left office.\n\nIn 1804, after the disastrous 1800 election and House runoff election between Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr the 12th Amendment was ratified, which required separate votes for presidential and vice presidential candidates. Congressional caucuses were then used to pick presidential and vice presidential candidates.\n\nBut within three decades, national nomination conventions replaced congressional caucuses as the method for choosing party nominees for president. Another House runoff in 1824 between John Quincy Adams and Andrew Jackson led to a renewed desire for state party leaders to have a bigger say in the process.\n\nThe first organized convention was held by the now-forgotten Anti-Masonic Party in 1831. Next, an anti-Jackson party, the National Republicans, had their own national meeting in December 1831. Henry Clay was picked as the party\u2019s presidential nominee. The 1832 Democratic convention nominated Jackson to run for a second term.\n\nThe national party convention system stood unchallenged until the 1970s, but the first presidential primaries began in the early 1900s as part of the Progressive movement. By 1916, 20 Democratic and Republican parties had primary elections, but they had little impact on how political bosses picked convention delegates and influenced conventions.\n\nThe Primary System Era\n\nThe primary system came into play fully after World War II. Incumbent President Harry S. Truman lost in the 1952 New Hampshire presidential primary, amid poor popularity numbers, and dropped from the race. Sen. Estes Kefauver of Tennessee won 12 of 15 Democratic primaries, but the Democratic convention instead chose Illinois Gov. Adlai Stevenson, who skipped the entire primary season. Stevenson won on the third convention ballot after Truman and other party leaders persuaded him to run.\n\nIn 1960, Democratic Sen. John F. Kennedy won his party\u2019s nomination at a Los Angeles convention by leveraging the system of primary elections as a new factor in presidential campaigning. Kennedy had to heavily lobby political bosses to get a first-ballot nomination. But his strong performance in the West Virginia primary made voter-driven state primaries a new force in the process of selecting a president.\n\nThe final crack in the traditional convention process came eight years later at the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago. Minnesota Sen. Eugene McCarthy, who won the most primary votes, lost to fellow Minnesota Sen. Hubert Humphrey in the delegate count. Humphrey had not run as an announced candidate in the 17 primaries, and only 38 percent of convention delegates were chosen by voters in primaries. (Republicans picked just 34 percent of delegates in primaries.)\n\nBoth parties soon initiated reforms to ensure that more voters had a direct role in choosing political nominees. In 1976, Democrats selected 73 percent of convention delegates in primaries, while Republicans chose 68 percent. In 1980, the name \u201cSuper Tuesday\u201d was used to describe the final Tuesday of the primary season in June, when a key group of states that included California and New Jersey cast votes.\n\nThe 1984 campaign was seen as starting the modern movement toward a more sweeping Super Tuesday in March using a concept known as \u201cfrontloading\u201d the primaries. Nine states were in play on March 13, 1984, as Vice President Walter Mondale took Georgia and survived the loss of seven states to Colorado Sen. Gary Hart to remain in the presidential campaign and get the nomination at the Democratic National Convention. By 2008, 24 states had moved their primaries to Tuesday, Feb. 5, in an effort to sort out the frontrunners early by putting about half of the delegates in play on the same election day.\n\nIn this year\u2019s election, Super Tuesday will be held on March 5, 2024. Primary elections will be held in 15 states and one territory (American Samoa) in the GOP presidential primaries. About 36 percent of Republican convention delegates will be elected in one day. The Democratic presidential primaries in 14 states and American Samoa will pick about one-third of party delegates.\n\nHere is the list of Super Tuesday states, from the National Conference of State Legislatures:\n\nAlabama\n\nAlaska (GOP only)\n\nArkansas\n\nCalifornia\n\nColorado\n\nMaine\n\nMassachusetts\n\nMinnesota\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nOklahoma\n\nTennessee\n\nTexas\n\nUtah\n\nVermont\n\nVirginia\n\nThe primary season concludes on June 4, 2024. The Democratic National Convention will be held from August 19-22 in Chicago. The Republican National Convention will be held from July 15-18 in Wisconsin.\n\nScott Bomboy is the editor in chief of the National Constitution Center.",

        "text": "HPU Poll: North Carolina Presidential and Gubernatorial Primaries\nPresidential generic ballot shows 47% of likely and self-reported primary voters prefer a GOP candidate, 41% prefer a Democrat among N.C. likely and self-reported primary voters.\n\nHIGH POINT, N.C., March 1, 2024 \u2013 A new High Point University Poll finds North Carolinians likely to vote or those reporting they voted in the 2024 North Carolina Republican primary for president prefer former President Donald Trump (69%) to other candidates on the ballot.\n\nNote: In this press release, we report a combination of voters we determined are most likely to vote in the primary elections and respondents who said they had already voted in the primaries. We refer to this combined sample as likely and self-reported primary voters.\n\nNikki Haley received 24% of the vote among likely and self-reported Republican primary voters. Other candidates on the ballot had 3% support or less and have already suspended their campaigns but remain on the ballot.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has no opposition on the ballot, and likely and self-reported Democratic primary voters give him 87% of the vote. Thirteen percent of the likely and self-identified primary voters chose \u201cNo Preference.\u201d\n\nNorth Carolina Primaries for Governor, Lieutenant Governor and Attorney General\n\nIn the Democratic primary for governor of North Carolina, Josh Stein has 57% of the vote among likely and self-reported Democratic primary voters. He is followed by Michael R. Morgan (14%), Gary Foxx (10%), Chrelle Booker (10%) and Marcus Williams (9%).\n\nIn the Republican primary for governor, Lieutenant Governor Mark Robinson has 51% support among these likely and self-reported Republican primary voters. Bill Graham and Dale Folwell have less support with these voters, receiving 33% and 17% of the vote, respectively.\n\nIn the race for the Democratic nomination for lieutenant governor of North Carolina, Rachel Hunt has the most support (61%) among likely and self-reported Democratic primary voters. She is followed by Mark H. Robinson (24%) and Ben Clark (14%).\n\nThe Republican nomination battle for lieutenant governor of North Carolina appears to be divided among several candidates. The poll finds Jim O\u2019Neill has support from 27% of these likely and self-reported Republican primary voters. The rest of the respondents preferred Sam Page (13%), Jeffrey Elmore (11%), Seth Woodall (11%), Deanna Ballard (10%), Hal Weatherman (7%) or Peter Boykin (7%). Less than 5% of the vote was for Marlenis Hernandez Novoa (4%), Allen Mashburn (4%), Ernest T. Reeves (4%) and Rivera Douthit (2%).\n\nThere is no clear front-runner in the Democratic primary for attorney general of North Carolina. Democratic likely and self-reported primary voters appear to be split between Jeff Jackson (36%), Tim Dunn (33%) and Satana Deberry (31%).\n\nGeneral Election Generic Ballots for President and U.S. Congress\n\nWhen asked about their choices for president of the United States, 47% of these likely and self-reported primary voters said they would vote for the Republican Party\u2019s candidate if the Nov. 5 election were held today, 41% said they voted or would vote for the Democratic Party\u2019s candidate and 4% said they would vote for another party\u2019s candidate if one were on the ballot. Another 8% said they were unsure.\n\nWhen asked about their choices for U.S. Congress, 48% of these same likely and self-reported primary voters said they would vote for the Republican candidate if the election were held today, 43% said they voted or were more likely to vote for the Democratic candidate and 3% said they would vote for another party\u2019s candidate if one were on the ballot.\n\nGeneral Election Generic Ballots for N.C. Governor, Attorney General, General Assembly and Supreme Court\n\nWhen asked about their choices for North Carolina governor, 46% said they voted or would vote for the Democratic Party\u2019s candidate if the election were held today, 45% likely and self-reported primary voters said they would vote for the Republican Party\u2019s candidate, and 2% said they would vote for another party\u2019s candidate if one were on the ballot.\n\nWhen asked about their choices for North Carolina attorney general, 44% of these likely and self-reported primary voters said they would vote for the Republican candidate if the election were held today, 43% said they voted or would vote for the Democratic candidate, and 4% said they would vote for another party\u2019s candidate if one were on the ballot.\n\nWhen asked about their choices for North Carolina house of representatives, 45% of these likely and self-reported primary voters said they would vote for the Republican Party\u2019s candidate if the election were held today, 44% said they voted or would vote for the Democratic Party\u2019s candidate, and 2% said they would vote for another party\u2019s candidate if one were on the ballot.\n\nWhen asked about their choices for North Carolina senate, registered voters gave similar responses about the votes they already had cast or intended to cast. In all, 45% of these likely and self-reported primary voters said they voted or would vote for the Republican candidate if the election were held today, 43% said they voted or would vote for the Democratic candidate, and 3% said they would vote for another party\u2019s candidate if one were on the ballot.\n\nWhen asked about their choices for North Carolina supreme court justice, 44% of these likely and self-reported primary voters said they would vote for the Republican Party\u2019s candidate if the election were held today, 42% said they voted or would vote for the Democratic Party\u2019s candidate, and 3% said they would vote for another party\u2019s candidate if one were on the ballot.\n\nApproval Ratings for U.S. and N.C. Government Officials\n\nLikely and self-reported primary voters in the N.C. March primary gave President Biden a job approval rating of 38%, and 68% said that the country is on the wrong track. More than half of these same voters in North Carolina disapprove of the job the U.S. Congress (65%) is doing.\n\nOnly 36% of the likely and self-reported primary voters said they approved of how the U.S. supreme court was doing its job, and 39% of them approve of how the N.C. supreme court is doing its job. About the same proportion of these voters approved of the job the N.C. general assembly (39%) is doing.\n\n\u201cThere are some clear front-runners in top of the ballot races, and there is still some uncertainty about some of the lower profile races,\u201d said Dr. Martin Kifer, associate professor of political science and director of the HPU Poll. \u201cWe will see how all of this plays out when they count the votes on the primary Election Day. And there are some indicators in this poll that we could have some close statewide results in November.\u201d\n\nNote: In this poll, respondents were first screened to see if they identified themselves as registered. Then they were further screened to determine their likelihood of voting in the March 5 North Carolina primary. Voters who passed the likely voter screen or indicated they had already voted in the primary were included in the results reported in this release. There were total of 753 likely voters who passed the screen of which 620 were likely to vote and 133 indicated they had already voted. The memo accompanying this release includes findings for the 1,215 self-identified registered voters.\n\nLikely and self-reported Democratic primary voters \u2013 U.S. President (February 2024)\n\nIf the Democratic Primary for President of the United States were today, and you were filling out a Democratic primary ballot now, who would you vote for?

Dynata sent invitations to its panel of N.C. respondents and the SRC collected 1,215 responses on its Qualtrics platform. Respondents were asked two screening questions concerning their voter registration status. That group is considered to be self-reported registered voters. For the likely and self-reported primary voter sample, the respondents were asked an additional series of questions to determine whether they had voted or were likely to vote in the 2024 North Carolina primary elections. All screening questions are reported in the memo accompanying this release (https://www.highpoint.edu/src/hpupoll/ ). The SRC did all data analysis. The online sample is from a panel of respondents, and their participation does not adhere to usual assumptions associated with random selection. Therefore, it is not appropriate to assign a classic margin of sampling error for the results. The poll interviewed a total of 1215 self-identified registered voters. In this case, the SRC provides a credibility interval of plus or minus 3.3 percentage points to account for a traditional 95% confidence interval for the estimates (plus or minus 2.8 percentage points) and a design effect of 1.2 (based on the weighting). For the likely and self-reported primary voters (n = 753), that credibility interval is 3.9 percentage points. For likely and self-reported primary voters within Democratic and Republican primaries, the credibility interval is 6 percentage points. The data is weighted toward population estimates for age, gender, race, ethnicity and education based on North Carolina State Board of Elections numbers for registered voters (https://www.ncsbe.gov/results-data/voter-registration-data) and archival HPU Poll data on registered voters. Factors such as question wording and other methodological choices in conducting survey research can introduce additional errors into the findings of opinion polls. Percentages may not add to 100 because of rounding.\n\nFurther results and methodological details from the most recent survey and past surveys can be found at the Survey Research Center website. Materials online include past press releases as well as memos summarizing the findings (including approval ratings) for each poll since 2010.\n\nThe HPU Poll reports methodological details in accordance with the standards set out by AAPOR\u2019s Transparency Initiative, and the HPU Survey Research Center is a Charter Member of the Initiative.\n\nYou can follow the HPU Poll on X.\n\nDr. Martin Kifer, chair and associate professor of political science, serves as the director of the HPU Poll, and Brian McDonald is the associate director of the HPU Poll.",

        "text": "Israel-Gaza briefings: Biden treading carefully through political minefield\nIsrael-Gaza briefings: Biden treading carefully through political minefield\n\nBBC\n\nOn Monday afternoon, while snacking on ice cream with a late-night television talk show host, US President Joe Biden hinted that a new ceasefire was within reach in the Gaza War, perhaps as early as this coming Monday.\n\n\"My national security adviser tells me that we're close,\" he said.\n\nHis words, which the White House has since walked back, landed with a thud for many in the American Palestinian community.\n\nThen on Tuesday night in Michigan, one of the key battlegrounds in November's presidential election, more than 100,000 people in the Democratic primary cast their ballot for \"uncommitted\" as part of a protest organised by pro-Palestinian groups.\n\n\"This is a warning sign,\" said Lexis Zeidan, one of the organisers, on Tuesday night.\n\nThis has been a week in which Mr Biden has been reminded that the turmoil in the Middle East, and the White House's response to it, could translate into electoral peril.\n\nSince the start of the conflict after the 7 October attacks, the president has been caught in a vice, forced to make Middle East policy choices that anger key parts of his coalition.\n\nBut the Biden administration is treading carefully when it comes to substantive policy shifts. And despite this week's domestic pressure, the White House has largely remained set on its current course.\n\nAt a briefing on Thursday, US State Department Press Secretary Matt Miller said the US continues to give aid to Israel to support the nation's \"legitimate right\" to protect itself and prevent an attack like 7 October from happening again.\n\n\"There is a mistaken belief that the United States is able to dictate to other countries' sovereign decisions,\" he said. \"Israel makes its sovereign decisions - we make clear where we disagree with them.\"\n\nOn background, US officials have said that the Americans are considering delaying further arms shipments to Israel and other measures.\n\nAFP Mr Biden is trying to balance competing constituencies in his party\n\nMost opinion polls suggest the US public as a whole tends to support Israel in the conflict, even while key components of Mr Biden's Democratic coalition - young voters and people of colour - do not.\n\nThe domestic political calculations are complicated. His administration has to balance competing constituencies within the Democratic Party that could all claim they are essential to the president's re-election cause.\n\nPro-Palestinian groups in the US have called for a permanent ceasefire, support for diplomatic efforts in the United Nations and the threat of an end to American military aid to Israel if it does not change course.\n\n\"People are upset, and you've got to give them a reason not to be upset,\" says Jim Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute.\n\nHe describes the Biden administration's efforts so far as \"ham-fisted, half-measure statements about how we were sorry we didn't express more sympathy and we're working behind the scenes\".\n\nThe protest vote in Michigan amounted to less than the margin by which Mr Biden beat Republican Donald Trump in the state in 2020, but is much more than the 10,704 votes Democrat Hillary Clinton lost the state to him in 2016.\n\n\"There's no doubt that there were some folks in Michigan that wanted to send the president a message,\" Mitch Landrieu, the campaign's national co-chair, said on Thursday. \"Every issue is complicated, and this is one of them that needs to be worked through.\"\n\nGetty Images The protest vote in Michigan was small but campaigners like Dearborn Mayor Abdullah Hammoud wanted to send Mr Biden a message.\n\nIn reality, while the pro-Palestinian groups are a vocal minority, they are still a minority, says Derry Sragow, a California-based political consultant.\n\n\"There's a chunk of the electorate that is very much focused on Gaza, but it's very small,\" he says.\n\n\"That's not to say that how the president deals with Gaza is unimportant, but it is just another brushstroke on the canvas that voters are going to be looking at when they cast their vote.\"\n\nPolls show that the American public is more concerned about the economy, immigration and abortion rights.\n\nAnd even in Michigan, Mr Sragow notes, there are as many Jewish voters who are passionate about supporting Israel as there are pro-Palestinian voters. And Jewish voters continue to overwhelmingly support Democrats, with more than 70% backing him in 2020 and polls showing that majorities approve of his handling of the Gaza War.\n\nGetty Images Emotions are raw as civilian bloodshed continues in Gaza\n\nWith eight months until the election, Biden campaign officials are hoping that the prospect of a binary choice between Mr Biden and Mr Trump will encourage dissenting voices in the Democratic Party's political coalition to ultimately fall into line.\n\nCampaign officials are already pointing to a number of controversial policies Mr Trump implemented during his presidential term, such as moving the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and support for Jewish settlements on the West Bank.\n\nBut with new headlines of civilian bloodshed in Gaza virtually every day, emotions are raw. This week the death toll in Gaza surpassed 30,000, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. And on Thursday at least 117 Palestinians were killed and hundreds were injured during an aid delivery in Gaza.\n\n\"We're supposed to be in the position where you hurt us, you ignore us, you pay no attention to our feelings, but we'll have to vote Democrat?\" says Mr Zogby. \"Why can't you apply that same logic on the side of the Jewish community?\"\n\nMeanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has being going to lengths to dash any White House hopes that a change in rhetoric will put more pressure on Israel to conclude the war.\n\n\"From the beginning of the war, I have been leading a diplomatic campaign whose goal is to deflect the pressure to end the war prematurely,\" he said this week.\n\nMr Netanyahu seems finely attuned to the US domestic political situation, as well, and says the American public overwhelmingly supports his cause.\n\nAll of this suggests Mr Biden has few easy means to extricate himself from his current political predicament.\n\n\"He's been dealt a very, very limited, difficult hand to play,\" says Sragow. \"If I was a member of the senior staff advising Biden, I don't know what I would say other than just do what you think in your heart is the right thing to do.\"",

Yet the vaccine sceptic has a history of straying from the truth and spreading health information scientists say is false. Rachel Schraer investigates these two very different images.\n\nAbout 20 years ago, Professor Paul Offit received a phone call.\n\n\"Robert F Kennedy Junior called me and he said that he needed my help,\" says the scientist, whose vaccine against rotavirus is estimated to save some two thousand lives a day in the developing world.\n\nMr Kennedy, a member of the famous political dynasty and nephew of former president John F Kennedy, told Prof Offit he was looking for information. He wanted to reassure parents who were worried about the effects of a mercury-based preservative called thimerosal, found in some vaccines.\n\nProf Offit confesses he was excited to be able to talk a Kennedy through the studies, which showed children exposed to thimerosal (not found in most US vaccines anyway since 2001) were no worse off than those who hadn't had exposure.\n\nBut a year or so later, Mr Kennedy wrote an article published in Rolling Stone magazine which repeated baseless claims that thimerosal was causing health problems. It also wrongly claimed the vaccine that Prof Offit was working on at the time contained this preservative, suggesting this had driven him to misrepresent the risks. The article was later retracted due to a large number of inaccuracies.\n\nDespite these wrong claims, Mr Kennedy - now a presidential candidate - appeared on Joe Rogan's podcast last summer repeating his version of the story.\n\nWe contacted Mr Kennedy's team but they did not comment on this specific allegation.\n\n\"I think he's remarkably dishonest,\" Prof Offit says.\n\nYou can listen to Trending: \"The anti-vax candidate?\" on BBC Sounds.\n\nAnd yet, honesty is one of the main reasons RFK Jr's supporters from across the political spectrum have told the BBC they want him to be the next US president.\n\nA January Gallup poll suggested he was the only candidate with a more than 50% favourability rating among the public. That may not mean anything for how people will actually vote, though, with the two major party candidates still expected to draw the vast majority of votes.\n\nThe worry for both Democrats and Republicans, however, is that RFK Jr might siphon off votes in November that might have otherwise gone to their candidates - set to be Joe Biden and Donald Trump.\n\nGetty Images Kennedy with his wife, actress Cheryl Hines\n\nJay Scott, one supporter, described him as a \"courageous truth-teller\".\n\nAnother, Michigan-based independent voter Bryce Lipscombe told me: \"I just trust the man who has sued a bunch of these government agencies and won, who has actually proven that corruption exists.\"\n\nMany supporters from across the political spectrum said they liked the fact Mr Kennedy was promising to tackle the influence of big business on government, including pharmaceutical companies and the oil and gas industry,\n\nThey said they found his policies on immigration and drug legalisation to be sensible. And they pointed to his record as an environmental lawyer of suing companies that pollute, with some notable successes including cleaning up the Hudson River in New York.\n\nMr Kennedy appeared to speak especially to people who were unhappy with - or suspicious of - the US government and the rest of the world's response to the Covid pandemic.\n\nMr Kennedy's supporters point to genuine failings by public institutions on issues from the opioid crisis to the Iraq war as reasons they've lost trust in the two main parties.\n\nBut this doesn't change the fact there are also countless examples of Mr Kennedy spreading conspiracy theories, making false or misleading statements, and sticking by his positions regardless of the evidence presented to the contrary.\n\n\"Whenever presented with copious evidence and scientific studies that vaccines do not cause autism\u2026 or whatever health condition he attributes to them, it is never enough,\" said Dr David Gorski, professor of surgery at Wayne State University and managing editor of the site Science Based Medicine. \"He always moves the goalposts, demanding still more evidence.\"\n\nWhen contacted for comment, Mr Kennedy's team maintained that: \"Proper safety studies have never been conducted on vaccines: long-term, all-cause mortality studies comparing fully-vaccinated children to never-vaccinated children.\n\nMany Kennedy supporters echo this argument but Dr Gorski says it \"just plain not true\".\n\nHe explains that for decades countless groups of independent scientists have looked at the effect of vaccines on a huge range of specific health outcomes and found the benefits far outweigh any risks.\n\nFor Prof Offit, this tactic represents what he sees as the impossibility of debating him.\n\n\"What do you do with people like Robert Kennedy Junior?\" he asks. \"When he raises the question: 'Could this vaccine do harm?', and then excellent studies are done showing that it doesn't. And he just refuses to believe them, because he just claims conspiracy at every turn.\"\n\nBut the lack of people willing to debate Mr Kennedy has been held up as just another example - including the past removal of some of his social media accounts - of him being silenced and censored.\n\nThis \"censorship\" is part of the reason Mr Kennedy says he is running for president in the first place.\n\nHe was also part of a legal case against the BBC and other news media organisations claiming they and social media platforms colluded to censor him and others so they couldn't compete with them.\n\nFor New York magazine correspondent, Olivia Nuzzi, who has interviewed Mr Kennedy and followed his campaign, some of his supporters' deep mistrust of mainstream institutions, from scientists to the media, presents an \"impossible\" problem for those seeking to fact-check his claims. \"It's like two different universes of facts,\" she says.\n\nThose who distrust powerful institutions are \"willing to give someone the benefit of the doubt who they perceive to be righteously challenging that power,\" she says, and are, \"not interested in arguments from people that they perceive to be doing the bidding of those institutions\".\n\nGetty Images\n\nMany of RFK Jr's supporters are impatient with discussion of his stance on vaccines. Some think it's an attempt by the media to smear him. For others it is simply less important than other issues like the border, surveillance and the economy, including tackling the influence of powerful corporations.\n\nBut it seems crucial in the question of his relationship to the truth.",

Morial\n\nPresident and CEO\n\nNational Urban League\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re building an America where we recognize the inherent dignity of every single person, and where every American has the chance to live a life of purpose and meaning. This is my vision for the future.\u201d President Joe Biden, 2024 State of Black America\n\nBefore he was elected President of the United States, Joe Biden made history by becoming the first major-party general election candidate to develop an agenda for Black America: Lift Every Voice,\n\nOn his first day in office, he made history again by signing Executive Order 13985, Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities, which declared \u201cEqual opportunity is the bedrock of American democracy, and our diversity is one of our country\u2019s greatest strengths.\u201d Acknowledging \u201cthe unbearable human costs of systemic racism,\u201d the order made an unprecedented commitment to tackle inequality: \u201cAffirmatively advancing equity, civil rights, racial justice, and equal opportunity is the responsibility of the whole of our Government.\u201d\n\nMore than three years into his presidency, as he asks voters to elect him to another term, the National Urban League developed a special section of the 2024 State of Black America\u00ae, Evaluation for Progress: Report on the Biden Harris Administration.\n\nIn doing so, we honor the legacy of the man who originated The State of Black America, Vernon Jordan, who passed away three years ago this week. The 1976 report was a scathing response to President Gerald Ford\u2019s State of The Union Address, which failed to make a single mention of the plight of African Americans.\n\n\u201cThe slow but steady decline in racial cooperation and in the black condition became, in 1975, a headlong rush into the deep pit of depression and hardship,\" Jordan wrote. \"The condition of black Americans, once the benchmark of America's commitment to equality in justice, is now the object of malign neglect and hostile disregard.\"\n\nIn contrast, President Biden placed racial equity at the center of his Administration, committing that it would shape the legislation, regulations, federal investments, and agency actions his Administration championed. As our report makes clear, that commitment has resulted in meaningful policy changes for Black Americans across economic opportunity, education, health care, criminal justice, housing, the environment, and civil rights protections.\n\nCandidate Biden promised to invest in Black America and improve the economy. When President Biden took office, the unemployment rate was 6.3%. Today, it\u2019s 3.7%. The Black unemployment rate was 9.2%. Today, it\u2019s 5.3%.\n\nCandidate Biden promised a cabinet and senior staff that reflects the soul of America. The Biden White House is the most diverse in American history, with nearly 50% of current appointees identifying as people of color. Most notably, his Vice President is the first Black woman in history to hold the office, and he appointed \u2013 as promised \u2013 the first Black woman Supreme Court Justice.\n\nCandidate Biden promised to expand health care access. Under the Biden Administration, the Affordable Care Act has flourished. In the most recent enrollment period, more than 20 million Americans have signed up for plans, a record-breaking eight million more enrollments than previously recorded.\n\nParts of President Biden\u2019s equity agenda, unfortunately, have been blocked by Congress and an ultra-conservative Supreme Court.\n\nThe John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act would have restored anti-discrimination protections in the Voting Rights Act that were gutted by the Supreme Court. The Freedom to Vote Act would have expanded opportunities to register to vote and cast a ballot, and it would have prevented voter suppression through partisan gerrymandering and unlawful voter purges. President Biden gave a landmark address in January 2022 in Georgia, ground zero for voting rights, where he called for an end to the Senate filibuster to prevent a minority of Senators from blocking these bills. Filibuster reform can be accomplished by a simple majority in the Senate, which Democrats had. Senators Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona refused to change the filibuster rule for voting rights, however, blocking both bills.\n\nPlease visit StateOfBlackAmerica.org to read the full evaluation of the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s commitment to racial justice, and follow our livestream on Tuesday, March 5, at 9 a.m. Eastern Time for a presentation of the entire report.\n\n\n\n###\n\n9TBE 3/1/24 \u25aa 80 Pine Street \u25aa New York, NY 10005 \u25aa (212) 558-5300\n\nConnect with the National Urban League\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/NatUrbanLeague\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/naturbanleague\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/naturbanleague\n\nWebsite: https://www.NUL.org\n\nNewsletter: http://bit.ly/SubscribeNUL\n\nYouTube: http://bit.ly/YTSubNUL\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "More teens than ever are overdosing. Psychologists are leading new approaches to combat youth substance misuse\nBecause substance use and mental health are so intertwined, some programs can do prevention successfully with very little drug-focused content. In one of the PreVenture Program\u2019s workshops for teens, only half a page in a 35-page workbook explicitly mentions substances.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s fascinating about the evidence base for PreVenture,\u201d said clinical psychologist Patricia Conrod, PhD, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Montreal who developed the program. \u201cYou can have quite a dramatic effect on young people\u2019s substance use without even talking about it.\u201d\n\nPreVenture offers a series of 90-minute workshops that apply cognitive behavioral insights upstream (addressing the root causes of a potential issue rather than waiting for symptoms to emerge) to help young people explore their personality traits and develop healthy coping strategies to achieve their long-term goals.\n\nAdolescents high in impulsivity, hopelessness, thrill-seeking, or anxiety sensitivity face higher risks of mental health difficulties and substance use, so the personalized material helps them practice healthy coping based on their personality type. For example, the PreVenture workshop that targets anxiety sensitivity helps young people learn to challenge cognitive distortions that can cause stress, then ties that skill back to their own goals.\n\nThe intervention can be customized to the needs of a given community (in one trial, drag racing outstripped substance use as the most problematic thrill-seeking behavior). In several randomized controlled trials of PreVenture, adolescents who completed the program started using substances later than peers who did not receive the intervention and faced fewer alcohol-related harms (Newton, N. C., et al., JAMA Network Open, Vol. 5, No. 11, 2022). The program has also been shown to reduce the likelihood that adolescents will experiment with illicit substances, which relates to the current overdose crisis in North America, Conrod said (Archives of General Psychiatry, Vol. 67, No. 1, 2010).\n\n\u201cPeople shouldn\u2019t shy away from a targeted approach like this,\u201d Conrod said. \u201cYoung people report that having the words and skills to manage their traits is actually helpful, and the research shows that at behavioral level, it really does protect them.\u201d\n\nAs young people leave secondary school and enter college or adult life, about 30% will binge drink, 8% will engage in heavy alcohol use, and 20% will use illicit drugs (Alcohol and Young Adults Ages 18 to 24, National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, 2023; SAMHSA announces national survey on drug use and health (NSDUH) results detailing mental illness and substance use levels in 2021). But young people are very unlikely to seek help, even if those activities cause them distress, Murphy said. For that reason, brief interventions that leverage motivational interviewing and can be delivered in a school, work, or medical setting can make a big difference.\n\nIn an intervention Murphy and his colleagues are testing, young adults complete a questionnaire about how often they drink or use drugs, how much money they spend on substances, and negative things that have happened as a result of those choices (getting into an argument or having a hangover, for example).\n\nIn an hour-long counseling session, they then have a nonjudgmental conversation about their substance use, where the counselor gently amplifies any statements the young person makes about negative outcomes or a desire to change their behavior. Participants also see charts that quantify how much money and time they spend on substances, including recovering from being intoxicated, and how that stacks up against other things they value, such as exercise, family time, and hobbies.\n\n\u201cFor many young people, when they look at what they allocate to drinking and drug use, relative to these other things that they view as much more important, it\u2019s often very motivating,\u201d Murphy said.\n\nA meta-analysis of brief alcohol interventions shows that they can reduce the average amount participants drink for at least 6 months (Mun, E.Y., et al., Prevention Science, Vol. 24, No. 8, 2023). Even a small reduction in alcohol use can be life-altering, Murphy said. The fourth or fifth drink on a night out, for example, could be the one that leads to negative consequences\u2014so reducing intake to just three drinks may make a big difference for young people.\n\nConrod and her colleagues have also adapted the PreVenture Program for university students; they are currently testing its efficacy in a randomized trial across multiple institutions.\n\nChristie is also focused on the young adult population. As a policy intern with Students for Sensible Drug Policy, she created a handbook of evidence-based policies that college campuses can use to reduce harm among students but still remain compliant with federal law. For example, the Drug Free Schools and Communities Act mandates that higher education institutions formally state that illegal drug use is not allowed on campus but does not bar universities from taking an educational or harm reduction-based approach if students violate that policy.\n\n\u201cOne low-hanging fruit is for universities to implement a Good Samaritan policy, where students can call for help during a medical emergency and won\u2019t get in trouble, even if illegal substance use is underway,\u201d she said.\n\nUltimately, taking a step back to keep the larger goals in focus\u2014as well as staying dedicated to prevention and intervention approaches backed by science\u2014is what will help keep young people healthy and safe, Weiner said.\n\n\u201cWhat everyone can agree on is that we want kids to have the best life they can,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can start there, what tools do we have available to help?\u201d",

        "text": "Why state secretaries of state are important to elections\nJohn J. Martin is a research assistant professor of law at the University of Virginia.\n\nThey may be the most important government officials you can't name. Their decisions have the potential to alter election results. Scholars have referred to them as the \"guardians of the democratic process.\"\n\nWho are these unknown, but essential, officials?\n\nState secretaries of state.\n\nYou probably know only one person with the title \"secretary of state,\" Antony Blinken, who conducts foreign policy for the U.S. The others serve their individual states, overseeing numerous crucial state functions. In Michigan, the secretary of state provides motor-vehicle services, such as driver's licenses and auto registrations. In California, the secretary of state heads the public archives that document California history. And in many states, such as Pennsylvania, the secretary of state manages the process for business registration.\n\nPerhaps the most vital role that state secretaries of state play is that of chief election official.\n\nIn 38 states, the secretary of state supervises elections. This power is not confined simply to state and local elections, as the position title might suggest, but includes those on the federal level too.\n\nDespite their importance, secretaries of state have historically managed to avoid being the center of attention during election seasons. Times are changing, though.\n\nDisputes over election results and ballot access have become more prominent over the past half-decade. In turn, secretaries of state have faced newfound scrutiny and are likely to become more central figures in coming elections.\n\nPower from the Constitution\n\nThe basis for secretary of states' comprehensive authority is found in the text of the U.S. Constitution: Article I gives states the power to regulate the \"times, places, and manner\" of holding congressional elections. Under Article II, the states get to choose how they pick their electors in presidential elections.\n\nThe administration of federal elections is thus largely a state affair. Secretaries of state derive their power over state and local elections from the 10th Amendment, which reserves to the states all powers not expressly delegated or prohibited by the Constitution.\n\nThis dynamic explains why the Maine secretary of state's actions can range from keeping former President Donald Trump off the presidential primary ballot to overseeing the 2023 local elections.\n\nIt explains why controversies over election certification by Georgia's secretary of state occurred in both the 2020 presidential election and 2018 gubernatorial election.\n\nAs the chief election official, a secretary of state's influence over the democratic process can extend to every single elected office.\n\nSubstantial sway\n\nThe election-related powers wielded by secretaries of state naturally vary by state. There are, nevertheless, common features.\n\nThe majority of secretaries of state determine ballot eligibility for political parties and candidates. Such determinations are typically straightforward: Is the candidate old enough? Are they a natural-born citizen?\n\nYet, as recent events in Colorado and Maine concerning Trump's presidential eligibility under the 14th Amendment show, such decisions have the potential to be complex and extraordinarily significant.\n\nThe majority of secretaries of state also have the job of certifying the winners of primary and general elections within their states. This is why secretaries were often named as defendants in Trump's 2020 legal cases challenging the presidential election results.\n\nSecretaries of state often have substantial sway over how you vote. This can include what your ballot looks like on Election Day.\n\nFor example, the Montana secretary of state, like many secretaries, has the power to \"adopt statewide uniform rules\" setting out, among other things, the ordering of candidates on the ballot, how to handle write-in candidates and the procedure for correcting ballots.\n\nThese decisions may seem trivial, but as the infamous 2000 election fiasco in Florida showed, ballot design can quite literally affect electoral outcomes. That ballot was ordered in a way that caused some Al Gore supporters to accidentally vote for third-party candidate Pat Buchanan. Experts have argued that this cost Gore the election.\n\nPotential for abuse\n\nSecretaries of state can also control how your vote is counted. In Nevada, the secretary of state can adopt regulations imposing statewide standards for vote counting.\n\nThat system gave rise to conflict in the 2022 midterms between the Nevada secretary of state and county officials, when the secretary would not permit county officials to conduct a hand count of mail-in ballots before election day.\n\nLikewise, numerous secretaries of state have the ability to authorize the use \u2013 or nonuse \u2013 of voting equipment. Such powers were showcased in the wake of the 2020 election when many secretaries decertified voting machines that were subject to \"Stop the Steal\" audits by Trump supporters.\n\nThis list of powers is far from comprehensive. Indeed, some secretaries of state are granted such broad election authority that they have provoked concerns over the potential for abuse.\n\nThe Arizona secretary of state, for example, can determine the \"maximum allowable wait time\" at polls. Given the negative relationship between poll line length and voter turnout, such power, if misused, could effectively reduce voter participation.\n\nThe Arizona secretary of state can furthermore refuse to approve the certification of any election officer \u2013 people who help administer elections \u2013 seemingly for any reason that does not meet the secretary's \"satisfaction.\"\n\nWhile this authority normally would not raise red flags under a secretary of state acting in good faith, it could allow a secretary with an agenda \u2013 perhaps election denialism or favoring one candidate over another \u2013 to staff the state's election administration regime with ideologues.\n\nHow to hold accountable?\n\nI do not raise these examples to suggest that state secretaries of state are figures to be feared. The vast majority are, from my observations as a practitioner and scholar of election law, excellent public servants.\n\nNevertheless, their immense influence over the democratic process demonstrates the need for accountability measures in situations where secretaries of state abuse their power \u2013 perhaps by deliberately suppressing the vote or acting in an overly partisan manner.\n\nThe most obvious means of public accountability is elections. In most states in which the secretary of state is the chief election official, the secretary is in fact elected by the people.\n\nIn seven such states, however, the secretary of state is a political appointee of either the governor or legislature. Appointment certainly does not immunize a secretary from accountability. The barrier for removal, however, may be higher when politics enters the calculation \u2013 e.g., requiring a supermajority legislative vote for impeachment.\n\nThe drawback to this kind of accountability: lack of immediacy. If a secretary of state is actively harming the democratic process, waiting until the next election year to vote them out may not seem like the best option.\n\nOne alternative involves a lawsuit. In 2018, for instance, Georgia advocacy groups got a federal court to block then-Secretary of State Brian Kemp from tossing out absentee ballots without notifying voters.\n\nLawsuits are an imperfect solution. For one, voters will not always have the legal right to sue a secretary of state in every instance of wrongdoing. Furthermore, when a lawsuit is brought, the implication is often that harm has already been done.\n\nInternal checks and balances can provide additional accountability. When a secretary of state makes an important election-related decision, that decision could be subject to the scrutiny of another official. This is how it is done in Louisiana, where the secretary of state's decisions on issues such as absentee and early voting require the approval of the state's attorney general.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.",

He has previously promised mass deportations if he wins power again.\n\nThe issue is an intense focus because more than 6.3 million migrants have been detained crossing into the US illegally during Mr Biden's tenure - a higher number than under previous presidencies.\n\nHowever, experts say the reasons for the spike are complex - with some factors pre-dating his government and sitting outside American control.",

        "text": "2024 Michigan Republican presidential nominating contests\nThe 2024 Michigan Republican presidential primary and caucuses were held on February 27 and on March 2, 2024, respectively, as part of the Republican Party primaries for the 2024 presidential election. 55 delegates to the 2024 Republican National Convention were allocated on a proportional and winner-take-most basis.[1] The primary took place concurrently with its Democratic counterpart, and saw Trump defeat Haley in a 42-point landslide.[2]\n\nBackground [ edit ]\n\nIn the 2016 Michigan Republican presidential primary, Donald Trump won with 36.5% of the vote, carrying 25 out of 59 delegates total. His closest opponents, Governor of Ohio John Kasich and Senator from Texas Ted Cruz, received 24.9% and 24.3% of the vote, respectively, with both candidates receiving 17 delegates.[3]\n\nMichigan GOP 2024 schism [ edit ]\n\nA court case was heard in Grand Rapids by Kent County Judge J. Joseph Rossi in late February determined who controls the state party. Judge Rossi dismissed a lawsuit by Karamo on February 20 to dismiss the case allowing for full hearings on the lawsuit filed by Karamo's critics later in the week regarding whether the RNC recognized chair Hoekstra or Karamo controls the MIGOP.[4] Judge Rossi on February 27 issued a preliminary injunction against Karamo, stating was properly removed as MIGOP chair and barring access by her to MIGOP bank accounts or post office boxes. Karamo declined to say whether she would appeal the ruling and had no comment as to whether the Detroit caucuses will take place.[5][6] A full trial regarding control of the MIGOP is scheduled to take place on June 10.[7] The Michigan Court of Appeals denied a request on February 29 by Karamo to issue a stay on the court order putting her Detroit caucus in doubt.[8] The chaos affected northern Michigan GOP participants from Michigan's 1st congressional district who had planned to go to Detroit but were barred by missing the deadline to take part in the Grand Rapids caucus. So a third gathering is planned the same day in Houghton Lake.[9] A contingent from Michigan's 4th congressional district was also denied credentials for the Grand Rapids caucuses, so a fourth gathering was announced for the same day in Battle Creek.[10] The Detroit gathering was cancelled.[11] Judge Rossi ruled that Karamo was properly removed as MIGOP chair.[12]\n\nProcedure [ edit ]\n\n16 at-large delegates are allocated based on the results of the February 27 primary to candidates who receive at least 12.5% of the statewide vote.\n\n39 district delegates are allocated based on the results of caucuses in each of the state's 13 congressional districts on March 2. Each of the state's thirteen congressional districts are awarded three delegates. The candidate who wins the majority of the vote in a caucus is awarded all that district's delegates; otherwise, the candidate with the highest vote total is awarded two delegates and the candidate with the second-highest vote total is awarded one delegate.\n\nSchedule [ edit ]\n\nIn February 2023, Governor Gretchen Whitmer signed legislation to move up the date of both the Democratic and Republican presidential primaries in Michigan to February 27, 2024, in line with the Democratic National Committee's (DNC) state reorganization plan.[13]\n\nThe date violated Republican Party Rule 16(c)(1), which prohibits any state/territory except Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina, from holding their primary/caucus until March 1, 2024, violating any other state/territory by stripping 80% of its delegates at the Republican National Convention.\n\nIn response, in June 2023, the Michigan Republican Party (MIGOP) passed a resolution of intent that would allocate 16 delegates based on the results of the February 27 primary and 39 delegates based on the results of caucuses in each of the state's 13 congressional districts on March 2.[14]\n\nThe convention held by the faction of the Michigan Republican Party recognized by the Republican National Committee led by Pete Hoekstra will be in Grand Rapids at the Amway Grand Plaza Hotel on March 2,[15] while the faction of the Michigan Republican Party led by Kristina Karamo will hold their convention in Detroit at Huntington Place on the same day.[16] While media is invited to the Karamo caucus, it will be closed to the public.[17] The RNC has indicated that only the delegates from the Hoekstra-led convention will be seated for the 2024 Republican National Convention.[18] A court ruling by Judge Joseph Rossi on February 27 indicated that Karamo was properly removed as MIGOP chair[19] and barred Karamo from conducting business on behalf of the \"Michigan Republican State Committee or the Michigan Republican Party\".[20] Rossi made his ruling retroactive to January 6.[21] A full trial regarding control of the MIGOP is scheduled to take place on June 10.[22] The Michigan Court of Appeals denied a request on February 29 by Karamo to issue a stay on the court order while her appeal is under consideration, putting her Detroit caucus in doubt.[23] The chaos affected delegates from Michigan's 1st congressional district who had planned to go to Detroit but were barred credentials to take part in the Grand Rapids convention; a third gathering is planned the same day in Houghton Lake.[24] A contingent from Michigan's 4th congressional district was also denied credentials for the Grand Rapids caucuses, so a fourth gathering was announced for the same day in Battle Creek.[25] The Detroit gathering was cancelled.[26]\n\nThe Michigan Secretary of State has identified the following candidates, listed alphabetically, as potential Republican Party presidential candidates in 2024:[27]\n\nEndorsements [ edit ]\n\nMaps [ edit ]\n\nEndorsements by incumbent Republicans in the Michigan House of Representatives.\n\nEndorsed Donald Trump (40) Endorsed Nikki Haley (1) No endorsement (13)\n\n\n\n\n\nPolling [ edit ]\n\nSource of poll\n\naggregation Dates\n\nadministered Dates\n\nupdated Nikki\n\nHaley Donald\n\nTrump Other/\n\nUndecided [ a ] Margin FiveThirtyEight [ 45 ] through February 24, 2024 February 27, 2024 21.8% 78.7% - Trump +56.9\n\nResults [ edit ]\n\nPrimary [ edit ]\n\nCaucus [ edit ]\n\nCBS called the results for Donald Trump at 6:02PM (EST) with Trump winning all 39 delegates available from the caucus.[58]\n\nMichigan Republican caucus, March 2, 2024 [ 59 ] Candidate Votes Percentage Actual delegate count Bound Unbound Total Donald Trump 1,575 97.77% 39 0 39 Nikki Haley 36 2.23% 0 0 0 Total: 1,611 100.00% 39 0 39 Source: [ 60 ]\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nNotes [ edit ]\n\n^ Calculated by taking the difference of 100% and all other candidates combined. ^ Key:\n\nA \u2013 all adults\n\nRV \u2013 registered voters\n\nLV \u2013 likely voters\n\nV \u2013 unclear ^ Francis Suarez with 0% ^ Liz Cheney with 1%; Greg Abbott and Kristi Noem with 0% ^ Liz Cheney with 3%; Glenn Youngkin, Greg Abbott, and Kristi Noem with 0% ^ Liz Cheney with 3%; Mike Pompeo and Glenn Youngkin with 1%; Greg Abbott and Kristi Noem with 0% ^ Liz Cheney with 3%; Greg Abbott and Mike Pompeo with 1%; Kristi Noem and Glenn Youngkin with 0% ^ Liz Cheney with 3%; Greg Abbott, Kristi Noem, and Mike Pompeo with 1%; Ted Cruz and Glenn Youngkin with 0% ^ Liz Cheney with 3%; Mike Pompeo and Ted Cruz with 1%; Kristi Noem, Greg Abbott, and Glenn Youngkin with 0% ^ Ted Cruz with 3%; Liz Cheney with 2%; Mike Pompeo and Kristi Noem with 1%; Greg Abbott and Glenn Youngkin with 0%\n\nPartisan clients\n\n^ Poll commissioned by MIRS",

        "text": "Trump supporters target black voters with faked AI images\nTrump supporters target black voters with faked AI images\n\nAI-GENERATED IMAGE This image, created by a radio host and his team using AI, is one of dozens of fakes portraying black Trump supporters\n\nDonald Trump supporters have been creating and sharing AI-generated fake images of black voters to encourage African Americans to vote Republican.\n\nBBC Panorama discovered dozens of deepfakes portraying black people as supporting the former president.\n\nMr Trump has openly courted black voters, who were key to Joe Biden's election win in 2020.\n\nBut there's no evidence directly linking these images to Mr Trump's campaign.\n\nThe co-founder of Black Voters Matter, a group which encourages black people to vote, said the manipulated images were pushing a \"strategic narrative\" designed to show Mr Trump as popular in the black community.\n\nA creator of one of the images told the BBC: \"I'm not claiming it's accurate.\"\n\nThe fake images of black Trump supporters, generated by artificial intelligence (AI), are one of the emerging disinformation trends ahead of the US presidential election in November.\n\nUnlike in 2016, when there was evidence of foreign influence campaigns, the AI-generated images found by the BBC appear to have been made and shared by US voters themselves.\n\nOne of them was Mark Kaye and his team at a conservative radio show in Florida.\n\nThey created an image of Mr Trump smiling with his arms around a group of black women at a party and shared it on Facebook, where Mr Kaye has more than one million followers.\n\nAt first it looks real, but on closer inspection everyone's skin is a little too shiny and there are missing fingers on people's hands - some tell-tale signs of AI-created images.\n\n\"I'm not a photojournalist,\" Mr Kaye tells me from his radio studio.\n\n\"I'm not out there taking pictures of what's really happening. I'm a storyteller.\"\n\nRadio show host Mark Kaye told the BBC that it was the individual's problem if their vote was influenced by AI images\n\nHe had posted an article about black voters supporting Mr Trump and attached this image to it, giving the impression that these people all support the former president's run for the White House.\n\nIn the comments on Facebook, several users appeared to believe the AI image was real.\n\n\"I'm not claiming it is accurate. I'm not saying, 'Hey, look, Donald Trump was at this party with all of these African American voters. Look how much they love him!'\" he said.\n\n\"If anybody's voting one way or another because of one photo they see on a Facebook page, that's a problem with that person, not with the post itself.\"\n\nAnother widely viewed AI image the BBC investigation found shows Mr Trump posing with black voters on a front porch. It had originally been posted by a satirical account that generates images of the former president, but only gained widespread attention when it was reposted with a new caption falsely claiming that he had stopped his motorcade to meet these people.\n\nAI-GENERATED IMAGE This image was widely viewed on social media with a caption saying Trump had stopped his motorcade to pose with these men\n\nWe tracked down the person behind the account called Shaggy, who is a committed Trump supporter living in Michigan.\n\n\"[My posts] have attracted thousands of wonderful kind-hearted Christian followers,\" he said in messages sent to the BBC on social media.\n\nWhen I tried to question him on the AI-generated image he blocked me. His post has had over 1.3 million views, according to the social media site X. Some users called it out, but others seemed to have believed the image was real.\n\nI did not find similarly manipulated images of Joe Biden with voters from a particular demographic. The AI images of the president tend to feature him alone or with other world leaders such as Russian President Vladimir Putin or former US President Barack Obama.\n\nSome are created by critics, others by supporters.\n\nIn January, the Democratic candidate was himself a victim of an AI-generated impersonation.\n\nAn automated audio call, purportedly voiced by the president, urged voters to skip the New Hampshire primary where he was running. A Democratic Party supporter has admitted responsibility, saying he wanted to draw attention to the potential for the technology to be abused.\n\nCliff Albright, the co-founder of campaign group Black Voters Matter, said there appeared to be a resurgence of disinformation tactics targeting the black community, as in the 2020 election.\n\n\"There have been documented attempts to target disinformation to black communities again, especially younger black voters,\" he said.\n\nCliff Albright, who runs an organisation encouraging black people to vote, says younger black voters are targeted for disinformation\n\nI show him the AI-generated pictures in his office in Atlanta, Georgia - a key election battleground state where convincing even a small slice of the overall black vote to switch from Mr Biden to Mr Trump could prove decisive.\n\nA recent New York Times and Sienna College poll found that in six key swing states 71% of black voters would back Mr Biden in 2024, a steep drop from the 92% nationally that helped him win the White House at the last election.\n\nMr Albright said the fake images were consistent with a \"very strategic narrative\" pushed by conservatives - from the Trump campaign down to influencers online - designed to win over black voters. They are particularly targeting young black men, who are thought to be more open to voting for Mr Trump than black women.\n\nOn Monday, MAGA Inc, the main political action committee backing Trump, is due to launch an advertising campaign targeting black voters in Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\n\nIt is aimed at voters like Douglas, a taxi driver in Atlanta.\n\nJustin Webb and Marianna Spring travel from the frozen plains of Iowa to the swing state of Georgia to explore Donald Trump's enduring appeal and look ahead to an unprecedented American election year.\n\nWatch on BBC One at 20:00 on Monday 4 March (20:30 in Wales and Northern Ireland) - and later on iPlayer.\n\nDouglas said he was mainly worried about the economy and immigration - issues which he felt Trump was more focused on. He said Democratic messaging about Trump's threat to democracy would not motivate him to vote, because he was already disillusioned with the electoral process.\n\nThe US economy is generally doing well, but some voters - like Douglas - don't feel better off because they've also been through a cost of living crisis.\n\nWhat did he think of the AI-generated image of Trump sitting on a front porch with black voters? When I first showed it to him, he believed it was real. He said it bolstered his view, shared by some other black people he knows, that Trump is supportive of the community.\n\nThen, I revealed it was a fake.\n\n\"Well, that's the thing about social media. It's so easy to fool people,\" he said.\n\n\"It's so easy to fool people\" on social media, says cab driver Douglas, after viewing one of the AI fakes\n\nDisinformation tactics in the US presidential elections have evolved since 2016, when Donald Trump won. Back then, there were documented attempts by hostile foreign powers, such as Russia, to use networks of inauthentic accounts to try to sow division and plant particular ideas.\n\nIn 2020, the focus was on home-grown disinformation - particularly false narratives that the presidential election was stolen, which were shared widely by US-based social media users and endorsed by Mr Trump and other Republican politicians.\n\nIn 2024, experts warn of a dangerous combination of the two.\n\nAI-GENERATED IMAGE At first glance, some voters miss the tell-tale signs of an AI-generated image - which sometimes can include extra arms\n\nBen Nimmo, who until last month was responsible for countering foreign influence operations at Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, said the confusion created by fakes like these also opens new opportunities for foreign governments who may seek to manipulate elections.\n\n\"Anybody who has a substantial audience in 2024 needs to start thinking, how do I vet anything which gets sent to me? How do I make sure that I don't unwittingly become part of some kind of foreign influence operation?\" he said.\n\nMr Nimmo said that social media users and platforms are increasingly able to identify fake automated accounts, so as it gets harder to build an audience in this way \"operations try to co-opt real people\" to increase the reach of divisive or misleading information.\n\n\"The best bet they have is to try and land [their content] through an influencer. That's anyone who has a big audience on social media,\" he said.\n\nMr Nimmo said he was concerned in 2024 that these people, who may be willing to spread misinformation to their ready-made audiences, could become \"unwitting vectors\" for foreign influence operations.\n\nThese operations could share content with users - either covertly or overtly - and encourage them to post it themselves, so it appears to have come from a real US voter, he said.\n\nAll of the major social media companies have policies in place to tackle potential influence operations, and several - like Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram - have introduced new measures to deal with AI-generated content during elections.\n\nLeading politicians from around the world have also highlighted the risks of AI-generated content this year.\n\nNarratives about the 2020 election being stolen - which were shared without any evidence - spread online with simple posts, memes and algorithms, not AI-generated images or video, and still resulted in the US Capitol riot on 6 January.",

        "text": "CBS News poll finds voters remember Trump's economy as good, boosting Trump to national lead over Biden today\nBiden facing more protest votes, Haley on last legs against Trump with Super Tuesday next week\n\nAs Super Tuesday makes an historic rematch all but official, voters are comparing not just two presidents, but two presidencies.\n\nAnd right now former President Donald Trump emerges from that comparison as the frontrunner. He leads President Biden by four points nationally, his largest lead to date. Here's why:\n\nVoters recall the economy under Trump more fondly than they rate the economy now.\n\nWhile neither gets great marks, voters today look back on Trump's presidency with relatively better retrospective ratings than they'd rate Mr. Biden's presidency so far.\n\n(For the record, in 2019 people did indeed rate the economy well, but views cratered in Trump's last year in office, during the pandemic.)\n\nThis is the case, despite the fact that views of today's economy keep inching up.\n\nThat's not helping Mr. Biden yet, at least not compared to Trump.\n\nThis is partly because Mr. Biden's policies are expected to cause price increases and Republicans overwhelmingly say they expect lower prices if Trump is elected.\n\nThis is part of a larger dynamic: Some of Mr. Biden's polling deficits come from his own Democratic base being relatively more critical of him. Twice as many Democrats call Mr. Biden's presidency fair or poor than Republicans describe Trump's presidency that way.\n\nMore voters think Trump \"fights for people like them\" than think Mr. Biden does.\n\nMore voters think Trump has a vision for the country than think Mr. Biden does.\n\nAnd then many of the Biden campaign's arguments on Trump's potential liabilities aren't getting enough traction to move Mr. Biden past Trump.\n\nDemocracy\n\nMost Americans think Trump did try to stay in office past his term, but just under half think he tried to do so illegally.\n\n(And they're voting overwhelmingly for Mr. Biden.)\n\nBut the rest of the country \u2014 including those who think he tried to stay legally, would overwhelmingly return Trump to office.\n\nSo, Mr. Biden has no significant advantage over Trump as the one who'll keep democracy safe.\n\nAbortion and IVF\n\nA majority think the overturning of Roe v. Wade was bad for the country, but far fewer blame Trump for it.\n\nBig majorities do think IVF should be legal.\n\nImmigration and the border\n\nTrump has a huge advantage on reducing the number of migrants crossing. It's an issue that most continue to say is at least very serious, if not a crisis.\n\nTrump v. Biden health\n\nAs has been the case for months, Trump is seen to have the physical and cognitive health to serve, more so than Mr. Biden.\n\nAnd finally, there's the motivations of voters and the party bases.\n\n\"Negative\" and \"depressing\" are voters' most commonly picked descriptions, when asked about their expectations of another Biden-Trump campaign.\n\nDemocrats, in particular, say so.\n\nMost of Mr. Biden's voters feel this is an election mostly about fear of what might happen; and more of them are voting to oppose Trump than because they like Mr. Biden.\n\nMost of Trump's voters say this is an election about hope for what might happen; more of them are voting Trump because they like him, not opposition to Mr. Biden.\n\nAnd the impact of that, at least for now, is simply this: Mr. Biden is trailing, in part, because Democrats are less likely to say they'll definitely vote.\n\nThis CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,159 U.S. adult residents interviewed between February 28-March 1, 2024. The sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, and education based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as past vote. The margin of error is \u00b12.8 points.\n\nToplines",

Martin is a research assistant professor of law at the University of Virginia.\n\nThey may be the most important government officials you can't name. Their decisions have the potential to alter election results. Scholars have referred to them as the \"guardians of the democratic process.\"\n\nWho are these unknown, but essential, officials?\n\nState secretaries of state.\n\nYou probably know only one person with the title \"secretary of state,\" Antony Blinken, who conducts foreign policy for the U.S. The others serve their individual states, overseeing numerous crucial state functions. In Michigan, the secretary of state provides motor-vehicle services, such as driver's licenses and auto registrations. In California, the secretary of state heads the public archives that document California history. And in many states, such as Pennsylvania, the secretary of state manages the process for business registration.\n\nPerhaps the most vital role that state secretaries of state play is that of chief election official.\n\nIn 38 states, the secretary of state supervises elections. This power is not confined simply to state and local elections, as the position title might suggest, but includes those on the federal level too.\n\nDespite their importance, secretaries of state have historically managed to avoid being the center of attention during election seasons. Times are changing, though.\n\nDisputes over election results and ballot access have become more prominent over the past half-decade. In turn, secretaries of state have faced newfound scrutiny and are likely to become more central figures in coming elections.\n\nPower from the Constitution\n\nThe basis for secretary of states' comprehensive authority is found in the text of the U.S. Constitution: Article I gives states the power to regulate the \"times, places, and manner\" of holding congressional elections. Under Article II, the states get to choose how they pick their electors in presidential elections.\n\nThe administration of federal elections is thus largely a state affair. Secretaries of state derive their power over state and local elections from the 10th Amendment, which reserves to the states all powers not expressly delegated or prohibited by the Constitution.\n\nThis dynamic explains why the Maine secretary of state's actions can range from keeping former President Donald Trump off the presidential primary ballot to overseeing the 2023 local elections.\n\nIt explains why controversies over election certification by Georgia's secretary of state occurred in both the 2020 presidential election and 2018 gubernatorial election.\n\nAs the chief election official, a secretary of state's influence over the democratic process can extend to every single elected office.\n\nSubstantial sway\n\nThe election-related powers wielded by secretaries of state naturally vary by state. There are, nevertheless, common features.\n\nThe majority of secretaries of state determine ballot eligibility for political parties and candidates. Such determinations are typically straightforward: Is the candidate old enough? Are they a natural-born citizen?\n\nYet, as recent events in Colorado and Maine concerning Trump's presidential eligibility under the 14th Amendment show, such decisions have the potential to be complex and extraordinarily significant.\n\nThe majority of secretaries of state also have the job of certifying the winners of primary and general elections within their states. This is why secretaries were often named as defendants in Trump's 2020 legal cases challenging the presidential election results.\n\nSecretaries of state often have substantial sway over how you vote. This can include what your ballot looks like on Election Day.\n\nFor example, the Montana secretary of state, like many secretaries, has the power to \"adopt statewide uniform rules\" setting out, among other things, the ordering of candidates on the ballot, how to handle write-in candidates and the procedure for correcting ballots.\n\nThese decisions may seem trivial, but as the infamous 2000 election fiasco in Florida showed, ballot design can quite literally affect electoral outcomes. That ballot was ordered in a way that caused some Al Gore supporters to accidentally vote for third-party candidate Pat Buchanan. Experts have argued that this cost Gore the election.\n\nPotential for abuse\n\nSecretaries of state can also control how your vote is counted. In Nevada, the secretary of state can adopt regulations imposing statewide standards for vote counting.\n\nThat system gave rise to conflict in the 2022 midterms between the Nevada secretary of state and county officials, when the secretary would not permit county officials to conduct a hand count of mail-in ballots before election day.\n\nLikewise, numerous secretaries of state have the ability to authorize the use \u2013 or nonuse \u2013 of voting equipment. Such powers were showcased in the wake of the 2020 election when many secretaries decertified voting machines that were subject to \"Stop the Steal\" audits by Trump supporters.\n\nThis list of powers is far from comprehensive. Indeed, some secretaries of state are granted such broad election authority that they have provoked concerns over the potential for abuse.\n\nThe Arizona secretary of state, for example, can determine the \"maximum allowable wait time\" at polls. Given the negative relationship between poll line length and voter turnout, such power, if misused, could effectively reduce voter participation.\n\nThe Arizona secretary of state can furthermore refuse to approve the certification of any election officer \u2013 people who help administer elections \u2013 seemingly for any reason that does not meet the secretary's \"satisfaction.\"\n\nWhile this authority normally would not raise red flags under a secretary of state acting in good faith, it could allow a secretary with an agenda \u2013 perhaps election denialism or favoring one candidate over another \u2013 to staff the state's election administration regime with ideologues.\n\nHow to hold accountable?\n\nI do not raise these examples to suggest that state secretaries of state are figures to be feared. The vast majority are, from my observations as a practitioner and scholar of election law, excellent public servants.\n\nNevertheless, their immense influence over the democratic process demonstrates the need for accountability measures in situations where secretaries of state abuse their power \u2013 perhaps by deliberately suppressing the vote or acting in an overly partisan manner.\n\nThe most obvious means of public accountability is elections. In most states in which the secretary of state is the chief election official, the secretary is in fact elected by the people.\n\nIn seven such states, however, the secretary of state is a political appointee of either the governor or legislature. Appointment certainly does not immunize a secretary from accountability. The barrier for removal, however, may be higher when politics enters the calculation \u2013 e.g., requiring a supermajority legislative vote for impeachment.\n\nThe drawback to this kind of accountability: lack of immediacy. If a secretary of state is actively harming the democratic process, waiting until the next election year to vote them out may not seem like the best option.\n\nOne alternative involves a lawsuit. In 2018, for instance, Georgia advocacy groups got a federal court to block then-Secretary of State Brian Kemp from tossing out absentee ballots without notifying voters.\n\nLawsuits are an imperfect solution. For one, voters will not always have the legal right to sue a secretary of state in every instance of wrongdoing. Furthermore, when a lawsuit is brought, the implication is often that harm has already been done.\n\nInternal checks and balances can provide additional accountability. When a secretary of state makes an important election-related decision, that decision could be subject to the scrutiny of another official. This is how it is done in Louisiana, where the secretary of state's decisions on issues such as absentee and early voting require the approval of the state's attorney general.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.",

        "text": "2024 Michigan Republican presidential nominating contests\nThe 2024 Michigan Republican presidential primary and caucuses were held on February 27 and on March 2, 2024, respectively, as part of the Republican Party primaries for the 2024 presidential election. 55 delegates to the 2024 Republican National Convention were allocated on a proportional and winner-take-most basis.[1] The primary took place concurrently with its Democratic counterpart, and saw Trump defeat Haley in a 42-point landslide.[2]\n\nBackground [ edit ]\n\nIn the 2016 Michigan Republican presidential primary, Donald Trump won with 36.5% of the vote, carrying 25 out of 59 delegates total. His closest opponents, Governor of Ohio John Kasich and Senator from Texas Ted Cruz, received 24.9% and 24.3% of the vote, respectively, with both candidates receiving 17 delegates.[3]\n\nMichigan GOP 2024 schism [ edit ]\n\nA court case was heard in Grand Rapids by Kent County Judge J. Joseph Rossi in late February determined who controls the state party. Judge Rossi dismissed a lawsuit by Karamo on February 20 to dismiss the case allowing for full hearings on the lawsuit filed by Karamo's critics later in the week regarding whether the RNC recognized chair Hoekstra or Karamo controls the MIGOP.[4] Judge Rossi on February 27 issued a preliminary injunction against Karamo, stating was properly removed as MIGOP chair and barring access by her to MIGOP bank accounts or post office boxes. Karamo declined to say whether she would appeal the ruling and had no comment as to whether the Detroit caucuses will take place.[5][6] A full trial regarding control of the MIGOP is scheduled to take place on June 10.[7] The Michigan Court of Appeals denied a request on February 29 by Karamo to issue a stay on the court order putting her Detroit caucus in doubt.[8] The chaos affected northern Michigan GOP participants from Michigan's 1st congressional district who had planned to go to Detroit but were barred by missing the deadline to take part in the Grand Rapids caucus. So a third gathering is planned the same day in Houghton Lake.[9] A contingent from Michigan's 4th congressional district was also denied credentials for the Grand Rapids caucuses, so a fourth gathering was announced for the same day in Battle Creek.[10] The Detroit gathering was cancelled.[11] Judge Rossi ruled that Karamo was properly removed as MIGOP chair.[12]\n\nProcedure [ edit ]\n\n16 at-large delegates are allocated based on the results of the February 27 primary to candidates who receive at least 12.5% of the statewide vote.\n\n39 district delegates are allocated based on the results of caucuses in each of the state's 13 congressional districts on March 2. Each of the state's thirteen congressional districts are awarded three delegates. The candidate who wins the majority of the vote in a caucus is awarded all that district's delegates; otherwise, the candidate with the highest vote total is awarded two delegates and the candidate with the second-highest vote total is awarded one delegate.\n\nSchedule [ edit ]\n\nIn February 2023, Governor Gretchen Whitmer signed legislation to move up the date of both the Democratic and Republican presidential primaries in Michigan to February 27, 2024, in line with the Democratic National Committee's (DNC) state reorganization plan.[13]\n\nThe date violated Republican Party Rule 16(c)(1), which prohibits any state/territory except Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina, from holding their primary/caucus until March 1, 2024, violating any other state/territory by stripping 80% of its delegates at the Republican National Convention.\n\nIn response, in June 2023, the Michigan Republican Party (MIGOP) passed a resolution of intent that would allocate 16 delegates based on the results of the February 27 primary and 39 delegates based on the results of caucuses in each of the state's 13 congressional districts on March 2.[14]\n\nThe convention held by the faction of the Michigan Republican Party recognized by the Republican National Committee led by Pete Hoekstra will be in Grand Rapids at the Amway Grand Plaza Hotel on March 2,[15] while the faction of the Michigan Republican Party led by Kristina Karamo will hold their convention in Detroit at Huntington Place on the same day.[16] While media is invited to the Karamo caucus, it will be closed to the public.[17] The RNC has indicated that only the delegates from the Hoekstra-led convention will be seated for the 2024 Republican National Convention.[18] A court ruling by Judge Joseph Rossi on February 27 indicated that Karamo was properly removed as MIGOP chair[19] and barred Karamo from conducting business on behalf of the \"Michigan Republican State Committee or the Michigan Republican Party\".[20] Rossi made his ruling retroactive to January 6.[21] A full trial regarding control of the MIGOP is scheduled to take place on June 10.[22] The Michigan Court of Appeals denied a request on February 29 by Karamo to issue a stay on the court order while her appeal is under consideration, putting her Detroit caucus in doubt.[23] The chaos affected delegates from Michigan's 1st congressional district who had planned to go to Detroit but were barred credentials to take part in the Grand Rapids convention; a third gathering is planned the same day in Houghton Lake.[24] A contingent from Michigan's 4th congressional district was also denied credentials for the Grand Rapids caucuses, so a fourth gathering was announced for the same day in Battle Creek.[25] The Detroit gathering was cancelled.[26]\n\nThe Michigan Secretary of State has identified the following candidates, listed alphabetically, as potential Republican Party presidential candidates in 2024:[27]\n\nEndorsements [ edit ]\n\nMaps [ edit ]\n\nEndorsements by incumbent Republicans in the Michigan House of Representatives.\n\nEndorsed Donald Trump (40) Endorsed Nikki Haley (1) No endorsement (13)\n\n\n\n\n\nPolling [ edit ]\n\nSource of poll\n\naggregation Dates\n\nadministered Dates\n\nupdated Nikki\n\nHaley Donald\n\nTrump Other/\n\nUndecided [ a ] Margin FiveThirtyEight [ 45 ] through February 24, 2024 February 27, 2024 21.8% 78.7% - Trump +56.9\n\nResults [ edit ]\n\nPrimary [ edit ]\n\nCaucus [ edit ]\n\nCBS called the results for Donald Trump at 6:02PM (EST) with Trump winning all 39 delegates available from the caucus.[58]\n\nMichigan Republican caucus, March 2, 2024 [ 59 ] Candidate Votes Percentage Actual delegate count Bound Unbound Total Donald Trump 1,575 97.77% 39 0 39 Nikki Haley 36 2.23% 0 0 0 Total: 1,611 100.00% 39 0 39 Source: [ 60 ]\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nNotes [ edit ]\n\n^ Calculated by taking the difference of 100% and all other candidates combined. ^ Key:\n\nA \u2013 all adults\n\nRV \u2013 registered voters\n\nLV \u2013 likely voters\n\nV \u2013 unclear ^ Francis Suarez with 0% ^ Liz Cheney with 1%; Greg Abbott and Kristi Noem with 0% ^ Liz Cheney with 3%; Glenn Youngkin, Greg Abbott, and Kristi Noem with 0% ^ Liz Cheney with 3%; Mike Pompeo and Glenn Youngkin with 1%; Greg Abbott and Kristi Noem with 0% ^ Liz Cheney with 3%; Greg Abbott and Mike Pompeo with 1%; Kristi Noem and Glenn Youngkin with 0% ^ Liz Cheney with 3%; Greg Abbott, Kristi Noem, and Mike Pompeo with 1%; Ted Cruz and Glenn Youngkin with 0% ^ Liz Cheney with 3%; Mike Pompeo and Ted Cruz with 1%; Kristi Noem, Greg Abbott, and Glenn Youngkin with 0% ^ Ted Cruz with 3%; Liz Cheney with 2%; Mike Pompeo and Kristi Noem with 1%; Greg Abbott and Glenn Youngkin with 0%\n\nPartisan clients\n\n^ Poll commissioned by MIRS",

        "text": "Trump supporters target black voters with faked AI images\nTrump supporters target black voters with faked AI images\n\nAI-GENERATED IMAGE This image, created by a radio host and his team using AI, is one of dozens of fakes portraying black Trump supporters\n\nDonald Trump supporters have been creating and sharing AI-generated fake images of black voters to encourage African Americans to vote Republican.\n\nBBC Panorama discovered dozens of deepfakes portraying black people as supporting the former president.\n\nMr Trump has openly courted black voters, who were key to Joe Biden's election win in 2020.\n\nBut there's no evidence directly linking these images to Mr Trump's campaign.\n\nThe co-founder of Black Voters Matter, a group which encourages black people to vote, said the manipulated images were pushing a \"strategic narrative\" designed to show Mr Trump as popular in the black community.\n\nA creator of one of the images told the BBC: \"I'm not claiming it's accurate.\"\n\nThe fake images of black Trump supporters, generated by artificial intelligence (AI), are one of the emerging disinformation trends ahead of the US presidential election in November.\n\nUnlike in 2016, when there was evidence of foreign influence campaigns, the AI-generated images found by the BBC appear to have been made and shared by US voters themselves.\n\nOne of them was Mark Kaye and his team at a conservative radio show in Florida.\n\nThey created an image of Mr Trump smiling with his arms around a group of black women at a party and shared it on Facebook, where Mr Kaye has more than one million followers.\n\nAt first it looks real, but on closer inspection everyone's skin is a little too shiny and there are missing fingers on people's hands - some tell-tale signs of AI-created images.\n\n\"I'm not a photojournalist,\" Mr Kaye tells me from his radio studio.\n\n\"I'm not out there taking pictures of what's really happening. I'm a storyteller.\"\n\nRadio show host Mark Kaye told the BBC that it was the individual's problem if their vote was influenced by AI images\n\nHe had posted an article about black voters supporting Mr Trump and attached this image to it, giving the impression that these people all support the former president's run for the White House.\n\nIn the comments on Facebook, several users appeared to believe the AI image was real.\n\n\"I'm not claiming it is accurate. I'm not saying, 'Hey, look, Donald Trump was at this party with all of these African American voters. Look how much they love him!'\" he said.\n\n\"If anybody's voting one way or another because of one photo they see on a Facebook page, that's a problem with that person, not with the post itself.\"\n\nAnother widely viewed AI image the BBC investigation found shows Mr Trump posing with black voters on a front porch. It had originally been posted by a satirical account that generates images of the former president, but only gained widespread attention when it was reposted with a new caption falsely claiming that he had stopped his motorcade to meet these people.\n\nAI-GENERATED IMAGE This image was widely viewed on social media with a caption saying Trump had stopped his motorcade to pose with these men\n\nWe tracked down the person behind the account called Shaggy, who is a committed Trump supporter living in Michigan.\n\n\"[My posts] have attracted thousands of wonderful kind-hearted Christian followers,\" he said in messages sent to the BBC on social media.\n\nWhen I tried to question him on the AI-generated image he blocked me. His post has had over 1.3 million views, according to the social media site X. Some users called it out, but others seemed to have believed the image was real.\n\nI did not find similarly manipulated images of Joe Biden with voters from a particular demographic. The AI images of the president tend to feature him alone or with other world leaders such as Russian President Vladimir Putin or former US President Barack Obama.\n\nSome are created by critics, others by supporters.\n\nIn January, the Democratic candidate was himself a victim of an AI-generated impersonation.\n\nAn automated audio call, purportedly voiced by the president, urged voters to skip the New Hampshire primary where he was running. A Democratic Party supporter has admitted responsibility, saying he wanted to draw attention to the potential for the technology to be abused.\n\nCliff Albright, the co-founder of campaign group Black Voters Matter, said there appeared to be a resurgence of disinformation tactics targeting the black community, as in the 2020 election.\n\n\"There have been documented attempts to target disinformation to black communities again, especially younger black voters,\" he said.\n\nCliff Albright, who runs an organisation encouraging black people to vote, says younger black voters are targeted for disinformation\n\nI show him the AI-generated pictures in his office in Atlanta, Georgia - a key election battleground state where convincing even a small slice of the overall black vote to switch from Mr Biden to Mr Trump could prove decisive.\n\nA recent New York Times and Sienna College poll found that in six key swing states 71% of black voters would back Mr Biden in 2024, a steep drop from the 92% nationally that helped him win the White House at the last election.\n\nMr Albright said the fake images were consistent with a \"very strategic narrative\" pushed by conservatives - from the Trump campaign down to influencers online - designed to win over black voters. They are particularly targeting young black men, who are thought to be more open to voting for Mr Trump than black women.\n\nOn Monday, MAGA Inc, the main political action committee backing Trump, is due to launch an advertising campaign targeting black voters in Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\n\nIt is aimed at voters like Douglas, a taxi driver in Atlanta.\n\nJustin Webb and Marianna Spring travel from the frozen plains of Iowa to the swing state of Georgia to explore Donald Trump's enduring appeal and look ahead to an unprecedented American election year.\n\nWatch on BBC One at 20:00 on Monday 4 March (20:30 in Wales and Northern Ireland) - and later on iPlayer.\n\nDouglas said he was mainly worried about the economy and immigration - issues which he felt Trump was more focused on. He said Democratic messaging about Trump's threat to democracy would not motivate him to vote, because he was already disillusioned with the electoral process.\n\nThe US economy is generally doing well, but some voters - like Douglas - don't feel better off because they've also been through a cost of living crisis.\n\nWhat did he think of the AI-generated image of Trump sitting on a front porch with black voters? When I first showed it to him, he believed it was real. He said it bolstered his view, shared by some other black people he knows, that Trump is supportive of the community.\n\nThen, I revealed it was a fake.\n\n\"Well, that's the thing about social media. It's so easy to fool people,\" he said.\n\n\"It's so easy to fool people\" on social media, says cab driver Douglas, after viewing one of the AI fakes\n\nDisinformation tactics in the US presidential elections have evolved since 2016, when Donald Trump won. Back then, there were documented attempts by hostile foreign powers, such as Russia, to use networks of inauthentic accounts to try to sow division and plant particular ideas.\n\nIn 2020, the focus was on home-grown disinformation - particularly false narratives that the presidential election was stolen, which were shared widely by US-based social media users and endorsed by Mr Trump and other Republican politicians.\n\nIn 2024, experts warn of a dangerous combination of the two.\n\nAI-GENERATED IMAGE At first glance, some voters miss the tell-tale signs of an AI-generated image - which sometimes can include extra arms\n\nBen Nimmo, who until last month was responsible for countering foreign influence operations at Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, said the confusion created by fakes like these also opens new opportunities for foreign governments who may seek to manipulate elections.\n\n\"Anybody who has a substantial audience in 2024 needs to start thinking, how do I vet anything which gets sent to me? How do I make sure that I don't unwittingly become part of some kind of foreign influence operation?\" he said.\n\nMr Nimmo said that social media users and platforms are increasingly able to identify fake automated accounts, so as it gets harder to build an audience in this way \"operations try to co-opt real people\" to increase the reach of divisive or misleading information.\n\n\"The best bet they have is to try and land [their content] through an influencer. That's anyone who has a big audience on social media,\" he said.\n\nMr Nimmo said he was concerned in 2024 that these people, who may be willing to spread misinformation to their ready-made audiences, could become \"unwitting vectors\" for foreign influence operations.\n\nThese operations could share content with users - either covertly or overtly - and encourage them to post it themselves, so it appears to have come from a real US voter, he said.\n\nAll of the major social media companies have policies in place to tackle potential influence operations, and several - like Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram - have introduced new measures to deal with AI-generated content during elections.\n\nLeading politicians from around the world have also highlighted the risks of AI-generated content this year.\n\nNarratives about the 2020 election being stolen - which were shared without any evidence - spread online with simple posts, memes and algorithms, not AI-generated images or video, and still resulted in the US Capitol riot on 6 January.",

        "text": "What does the Supreme Court\u2019s latest ruling mean for the 2024 presidential election and beyond? VCU analyst offers insight\nThe Supreme Court unanimously ruled Monday that states cannot remove Donald Trump from this year\u2019s presidential ballot for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attacks on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nJohn Aughenbaugh, Ph.D., a Supreme Court scholar and associate professor in Virginia Commonwealth University\u2019s Department of Political Science, offered insight into the ruling.\n\nWhat did the court actually determine in this ruling?\n\nAll the Supreme Court said was states like Colorado, Maine, Illinois \u2013 which had removed former President Trump from their ballots \u2013 all the Supreme Court said was they can\u2019t. They cannot because the challenges were basically based on the 14th Amendment, Section 3, of the Constitution. The Supreme Court said only the United States Congress, through passing a law, could remove a presidential candidate.\n\nThe election has not been decided. If former President Trump wins enough delegates at the Republican National Convention, he will be the Republican Party nominee in November.\n\nHow might this ruling be seen through a lens of partisanship?\n\nAll nine Supreme Court justices said that what Colorado attempted to do was unconstitutional, so it wasn\u2019t partisan. Now, did all nine agree in regards to the reasoning? No. Five [justices] quite clearly said Congress would have to pass a law defining why former President Trump\u2019s behavior violated Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. Justice Amy Coney Barrett decided the case on \u201cDid Colorado have the constitutional authority to do what it did?\u201d Her answer was no.\n\nThe three liberal justices criticized the per curiam opinion for basically saying the only way to remove somebody from a federal office ballot in a state is Congress passing a law. They would have left the door open as to other means in which somebody like former President Trump could be removed. But it was not a partisan decision.\n\nWhat is a larger takeaway from this ruling with respect to future elections?\n\nMost of us [constitutional law scholars] who read the transcripts or listened to the transcripts from the oral arguments last month are not surprised by the court\u2019s ruling today. I know there have been various commentaries already provided on X and other social media where liberals are very critical of the court. But again, it was a unanimous decision.\n\nIf you listen to the oral arguments from last month, even the liberal justices were taken aback by the problem that would arise \u2013 if what Colorado did was replicated across the country \u2013 because you could have individual states removing presidential candidates from their state ballots. If you just did that in a handful of battleground states, you would effectively determine the outcome of an election \u2013 and that\u2019s pretty awe-inspiring to think about.\n\nI\u2019m not entirely sure that states like Colorado, Maine, Illinois understood that this could be then used by Republican-controlled states in the future. That\u2019s the downside of using unusual or unique legal arguments or legal cases to remove a candidate or candidates from a particular party: Once that precedent is set, then the opposition party could use the same tactics in the future.",

The message was followed by a fundraising email sent to supporters of his campaign.\n\nSpeaking from his estate in Mar-a-Lago, Florida, soon afterwards, he said that the decision was \"very well crafted\" and will \"go a long way towards bringing our country together, which it needs\".\n\n\"You can't take someone out of a race because an opponent would like it that way,\" Mr Trump added.\n\nColorado's Secretary of State, Jena Griswold, said that she was disappointed by the ruling and that \"Colorado should be able to bar oath-breaking insurrections from our ballot\".\n\nAdditionally, the watchdog group that brought the case in Colorado, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew), said in a statement that while the court \"failed to meet the moment\", it is \"still a win for democracy: Trump will go down in history as an insurrectionist\".",

        "text": "Supreme Court says Trump can appear on 2024 ballot, overturning Colorado ruling\nWashington \u2014 The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday said states cannot bar former President Donald Trump from the ballot using a rarely invoked provision of the 14th Amendment, overturning a decision from Colorado's top court and handing the GOP presidential front-runner a victory in an unprecedented case that threatened to derail his bid to return to the White House.\n\nIn December, the Colorado Supreme Court determined that Trump was ineligible for the presidency due to his conduct surrounding the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. The Colorado court's divided decision rested on the Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, known as the insurrection clause, which bars oath-taking insurrectionists from holding public office.\n\nIn its opinion on Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court said only Congress can enforce the clause. The ruling resolves challenges to Trump's eligibility for office pursued by voters in several other states and comes one day before Super Tuesday, when voters in 15 states will cast their ballots for the Republican presidential nomination.\n\n\"Responsibility for enforcing Section 3 against federal officeholders and candidates rests with Congress and not the states,\" the court said in its 13-page unsigned opinion. \"The judgment of the Colorado Supreme Court therefore cannot stand.\"\n\nMembers of the media outside the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., on Monday, March 4, 2024. Valerie Plesch/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nJustices Amy Coney Barrett wrote separately to note that all nine justices agree on the outcome of the case, saying \"that is the message Americans should take home.\" The three liberal justices, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, issued an opinion concurring with the judgment, but said the court went too far in dictating \"novel rules\" for federal enforcement of Section 3.\n\nTrump cheered the decision, saying in remarks from his South Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, that is \"very important\" and \"well crafted.\"\n\n\"I think it will go a long way toward bringing our country together, which our country needs,\" he said.\n\nNoah Bookbinder, president of the group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington President, which brought the challenge to Trump's eligibility, said the decision allowing Trump back on the ballot rests on \"technical legal grounds.\"\n\n\"The Supreme Court had the opportunity in this case to exonerate Trump, and they chose not to do so. Every court \u2014 or decision-making body \u2014 that has substantively examined the issue has determined that January 6th was an insurrection and that Donald Trump incited it. That remains true today,\" Bookbinder said. \"The Supreme Court removed an enforcement mechanism, and in letting Trump back on the ballot, they failed to meet the moment. But it is now clear that Trump led the January 6th insurrection, and it will be up to the American people to ensure accountability.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision\n\nThe opinion from the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, was unanimous in reversing the Colorado Supreme Court's decision. The high court did not address the Jan. 6 Capitol assault or Trump's actions in the wake of the 2020 election.\n\n\"We conclude that States may disqualify persons holding or attempting to hold state office. But States have no power under the Constitution to enforce Section 3 with respect to federal offices, especially the Presidency,\" the court said in its opinion.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally on Saturday, March 2, 2024, in Richmond, Virginia. Steve Helber / AP\n\nIt went on to say that \"nothing in the Constitution delegates to the states any power to enforce Section 3 against federal officeholders and candidates.\"\n\nReversal of the Colorado decision ensures that votes cast for Trump in the state's Republican presidential primary will be counted, and his name will appear on ballots nationwide unless Congress itself acts, which is unlikely. The justices acted with rare speed in deciding the case, issuing their opinion less than a month after hearing arguments Feb. 8.\n\nThe decision was expected, since most of the justices raised concerns during oral arguments about allowing a lone state to disqualify a presidential candidate and what would follow in future presidential contests. Still, the dispute raised a number of novel legal issues and marked the first time the Supreme Court weighed the application of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment.\n\nIt also brought the justices to the forefront of a presidential election \u2014 a position they have not been in since the high court ruled in Bush v. Gore in 2000. Justice Clarence Thomas is the only member who was on the court then and remains today.\n\nThe court recognized the consequences of allowing states to enforce Section 3, and the conflicting outcomes about the same candidate that might occur.\n\n\"An evolving electoral map could dramatically change the behavior of voters, parties, and states across the country, in different ways and at different times. The disruption would be all the more acute \u2014 and could nullify the votes of millions and change the election result \u2014 if Section 3 enforcement were attempted after the nation has voted,\" the opinion said. \"Nothing in the Constitution requires that we endure such chaos \u2014 arriving at any time or different times, up to and perhaps beyond the Inauguration.\"\n\nThe concurring opinions\n\nThough all nine of the justices agreed that Colorado cannot enforce Section 3, the court's decision prompted division among the justices over the reasoning underlying that conclusion.\n\nIn a brief, one-page concurring opinion, Barrett said the challenge, which was brought under state law in state court, did not require the Supreme Court to address the \"complicated question\" of whether federal legislation is the sole vehicle through which Section 3 can be enforced. But she highlighted the agreement among the nine justices, particularly given the politically fraught nature of the case.\n\n\"The court has settled a politically charged issue in the volatile season of a presidential election. Particularly in this circumstance, writings on the court should turn the national temperature down, not up,\" wrote Barrett, who was appointed by Trump. \"For present purposes, our differences are far less important than our unanimity.\"\n\nSupreme Court justices pose for an official portrait on Friday, Oct 7, 2022, in Washington, D.C. Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images\n\nSotomayor, Kagan and Jackson, though, were at times highly critical of the five justices who fully signed onto the court's opinion. The three liberal justices accused their conservative colleagues of departing from the principle of judicial restraint by effectively deciding not only the Colorado case, but future challenges to a candidate's eligibility for office under Section 3.\n\nBy announcing that a disqualification for insurrection can happen only when Congress enacts a \"particular kind of legislation\" under another provision of the 14th Amendment, \"the majority shuts the door on other potential means of federal enforcement,\" they wrote in a joint opinion.\n\n\"They decide novel constitutional questions to insulate this court and [Trump] from future controversy,\" Sotomayor, Kagan and Jackson wrote.\n\nThe trio of justices called aspects of the majority's decision \"gratuitous.\" By resolving unsettled questions about federal enforcement of Section 3, they wrote, the court \"attempts to insulate all alleged insurrectionists from future challenges to their holding federal office.\"\n\nThe majority, the liberals said, \"reaches out to decide Section 3 questions not before us, and to foreclose future efforts to disqualify a presidential candidate under that provision. In a sensitive case crying out for judicial restraint, it abandons that course.\"\n\nChallenges in other states\n\nThe Supreme Court's ruling caps a period of uncertainty that followed the Colorado Supreme Court's historic conclusion that Trump was ineligible for a second term under Section 3 and should be excluded from the state's primary ballot.\n\nThe state court put its decision on hold to allow Trump to appeal to the Supreme Court, and ballots listing his name were printed and mailed to voters ahead of Colorado's March 5 primary election. In response to the opinion from the nation's highest court, Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold said in a statement that \"Donald Trump is an eligible candidate on Colorado's 2024 Presidential Primary.\"\n\nGriswold said in an interview with CBS News' \"America Decides\" on Monday that she was disappointed with the ruling, arguing that it will allow \"federal candidates who are oath-breaking insurrectionists to get onto ballots without much question.\"\n\n\"But the ruling is the ruling and I think it's important that we all respect the justices' decision,\" she said.\n\nOn the heels of the Colorado ruling, Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows issued a decision concluding that Trump is disqualified from holding the presidency. But she paused her ruling, and a state judge ordered Bellows, a Democrat, to revisit it after the Supreme Court ruled.\n\nBellows modified her ruling hours after the high court announced its decision, concluding that Trump is eligible for the Maine primary ballot and votes cast for him in Tuesday's primary will be counted.\n\nAn Illinois judge in late February, too, determined Trump is ineligible for office under Section 3 and should be removed from the state's primary ballot, but paused the decision so Trump can appeal, which he did last week.\n\nEfforts to knock Trump off the ballot were pursued in a number of states. But the challenge brought by a group of six voters in Colorado was the first \u2014 and only \u2014 to result in a ruling from a state's highest court that the former president couldn't return to the White House.\n\nStill, decisions from top courts in Michigan and Minnesota allowed voters to renew their challenges to Trump's eligibility for the general election ballot, leading to concerns that his name could be listed on the ballots in some states and not in others.\n\nThe Colorado decision, though, provided the catalyst for the Supreme Court's involvement. All parties \u2014 Trump, the group of voters and Colorado secretary of state \u2014 as well as legal scholars urged the justices to resolve the issue of his eligibility before most voters head to the polls for the 2024 election season.\n\nTrump has already won all but one of the Republican contests \u2014 GOP opponent Nikki Haley notched a win in the District of Columbia's GOP primary \u2014 and is expected to further cement his position as the front-runner for the GOP presidential nomination after Super Tuesday.\n\nThe case presented a number of untested legal issues for the justices to weigh, including whether Trump's efforts to subvert the transfer of presidential power after the 2020 election constituted engagement in insurrection, whether Section 3 applies to the president and the presidency, and whether states can enforce the insurrection clause without legislation from Congress.\n\nTrump needed to convince a majority of the justices to rule for him on just one of those matters to prevail.\n\nTrump's other legal issues\n\nThe Supreme Court's ruling is a rare courtroom win for Trump in his post-presidency legal woes that stretch from New York to Florida. And it is the first of several cases before the justices with ramifications for the former president.\n\nThe justices are poised to decide whether Trump can be criminally prosecuted for conduct that allegedly involved official acts while in the White House, with arguments set for late April and a ruling expected by the end of June. A three-judge panel of the federal appeals court in Washington found he is not entitled to broad immunity from federal prosecution.\n\nThe issue of whether Trump is shielded from criminal charges arose out of special counsel Jack Smith's case involving the former president's alleged efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe Supreme Court is also poised to hear arguments in April in a case challenging the reach of a federal obstruction law that has been used to prosecute scores of defendants in connection to the Capitol attack, and which Trump is accused by the special counsel of violating. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all four counts stemming from his actions surrounding the last presidential election.",

                "description": "Following U.S. termination of the Zimbabwe Sanctions Program, Treasury designates key actors under the Global Magnitsky ProgramWASHINGTON \u2014 Today, the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) designated 11 individuals, including Zimbabwe\u2019s President Emmerson Mnangagwa, and three entities for their involvement in corruption or serious human rights abuse pursuant to E.O.\u00a013818, which builds upon and implements the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act.Concurrently, President Biden signed an Executive Order (E.O.) terminating the national emergency with respect to Zimbabwe and revoking the E.O.s that have authorized Zimbabwe-specific sanctions. As a result, the economic sanctions administered by OFAC pursuant to the Zimbabwe sanctions program are no longer in effect.This transition to sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Program, consistent with recommendations in Treasury\u2019s 2021 Sanctions Review, emphasizes the U.S. commitment to promoting accountability for corrupt and abusive networks restricting the political rights and economic resources of the people of Zimbabwe.\u00a0\u201cThe United States remains deeply concerned about democratic backsliding, human rights abuses, and government corruption in Zimbabwe,\u201d said Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo. \u201cThe changes we are making today are intended to make clear what has always been true: our sanctions are not intended to target the people of Zimbabwe. Today we are refocusing our sanctions on clear and specific targets: President Mnangagwa\u2019s criminal network of government officials and businesspeople who are most responsible for corruption or human rights abuse against the people of Zimbabwe. These changes to our approach provide an opportunity for the Government of Zimbabwe to undertake key reforms to improve its record on human rights, good governance, and anti-corruption. Consistent with the findings of Treasury\u2019s 2021 sanctions review, we are committed to the use of economic sanctions towards a clear and specific objective, in coordination with diplomacy and other tools of statecraft.\u201dTERMINATION OF THE ZIMBABWE SANCTIONS PROGRAMThe President\u2019s E.O. of March 4, 2024, \u201cTermination of Emergency With Respect to the Situation in Zimbabwe,\u201d terminated the national emergency declared in E.O. 13288 and built upon in E.O. 13391 and E.O. 13469. As a result:All persons blocked solely pursuant to E.O. 13288, E.O. 13391, or E.O. 13469 (the authorities of the Zimbabwe Sanctions Program) will be removed today from OFAC\u2019s Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) List;All property and interests in property blocked solely pursuant to the Zimbabwe Sanctions Program will be unblocked today; andOFAC will remove the Zimbabwe Sanctions Regulations from the Code of Federal Regulations.Pending or future OFAC investigations or enforcement actions related to apparent violations of the Zimbabwe Sanctions Regulations that occurred while the national emergency was in effect may still be carried out.SANCTIONS TRANSITION UNDER THE GLOBAL MAGNITSKY PROGRAMEmmerson Mnangagwa (Mnangagwa)\u00a0is the President of Zimbabwe and is involved in corrupt activities, in particular those relating to gold and diamond smuggling networks.

Mnangagwa\u2019s reelection was marred by fraud, the deployment of groups who intimidated voters, and the use of government-organized \u201cferret teams.\u201d Since the election, the ferret teams, comprising intelligence, police, and military personnel, have likely been involved in the abduction of up to 12 individuals associated with civil society organizations or opposition parties, including Tapfumanei Masaya, who was found dead on November 13, 2023. Abductees report being pushed into vehicles, beaten and stripped naked, injected with unknown substances, threatened with retaliation, and later dumped on the roadside outside of Harare.

Ncube is designated pursuant to E.O. 13818 for being a foreign person that is responsible for or complicit in, or has directly or indirectly engaged in, serious human rights abuse.\u00a0SANCTIONS IMPLICATIONSBuilding upon the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, E.O. 13818 was issued on December 20, 2017, in recognition that the prevalence of human rights abuse and corruption that have their source, in whole or in substantial part, outside the United States, had reached such scope and gravity as to threaten the stability of international political and economic systems. Human rights abuse and corruption undermine the values that form an essential foundation of stable, secure, and functioning societies; have devastating impacts on individuals; weaken democratic institutions; degrade the rule of law; perpetuate violent conflicts; facilitate the activities of dangerous persons; and undermine economic markets. The United States seeks to impose tangible and significant consequences on those who commit serious human rights abuse or engage in corruption, as well as to protect the financial system of the United States from abuse by these same persons.\u00a0As a result of today\u2019s Global Magnitsky action, all property and interests in property of the designated persons described above that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked and must be reported to OFAC. In addition, any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, individually or in the aggregate, 50 percent or more by one or more blocked persons are also blocked. Unless authorized by a general or specific license issued by OFAC, or exempt, OFAC\u2019s regulations generally prohibit all transactions by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in property of designated or otherwise blocked persons.\u00a0In addition, financial institutions and other persons that engage in certain transactions or activities with the sanctioned entities and individuals may expose themselves to sanctions or be subject to an enforcement action. The prohibitions include the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any designated person, or the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.\u00a0The power and integrity of OFAC sanctions derive not only from OFAC\u2019s ability to designate and add persons to the SDN List, but also from its willingness to remove persons from the SDN List consistent with the law. This transition in sanctions authorities demonstrates OFAC\u2019s commitment to review and assess sanctions to ensure the integrity of designations and provides a clear and targeted approach to hold egregious human rights offenders and corrupt actors accountable. The ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish, but to bring about a positive change in behavior. This sanctions transition is an opportunity for those designated to acknowledge their responsibility for sanctionable conduct and take steps to correct their behavior.For information concerning the process for seeking removal from an OFAC list, including the SDN List, please refer to OFAC\u2019s Frequently Asked Question 897 here.

As a result, the economic sanctions administered by OFAC pursuant to the Zimbabwe sanctions program are no longer in effect.\n\nThis transition to sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Program, consistent with recommendations in Treasury\u2019s 2021 Sanctions Review, emphasizes the U.S. commitment to promoting accountability for corrupt and abusive networks restricting the political rights and economic resources of the people of Zimbabwe.\n\n\u201cThe United States remains deeply concerned about democratic backsliding, human rights abuses, and government corruption in Zimbabwe,\u201d said Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo. \u201cThe changes we are making today are intended to make clear what has always been true: our sanctions are not intended to target the people of Zimbabwe. Today we are refocusing our sanctions on clear and specific targets: President Mnangagwa\u2019s criminal network of government officials and businesspeople who are most responsible for corruption or human rights abuse against the people of Zimbabwe. These changes to our approach provide an opportunity for the Government of Zimbabwe to undertake key reforms to improve its record on human rights, good governance, and anti-corruption. Consistent with the findings of Treasury\u2019s 2021 sanctions review, we are committed to the use of economic sanctions towards a clear and specific objective, in coordination with diplomacy and other tools of statecraft.\u201d\n\nTERMINATION OF THE ZIMBABWE SANCTIONS PROGRAM\n\nThe President\u2019s E.O. of March 4, 2024, \u201cTermination of Emergency With Respect to the Situation in Zimbabwe,\u201d terminated the national emergency declared in E.O. 13288 and built upon in E.O. 13391 and E.O. 13469. As a result:\n\nAll persons blocked solely pursuant to E.O. 13288, E.O. 13391, or E.O. 13469 (the authorities of the Zimbabwe Sanctions Program) will be removed today from OFAC\u2019s Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) List;\n\nAll property and interests in property blocked solely pursuant to the Zimbabwe Sanctions Program will be unblocked today; and\n\nOFAC will remove the Zimbabwe Sanctions Regulations from the Code of Federal Regulations.\n\nPending or future OFAC investigations or enforcement actions related to apparent violations of the Zimbabwe Sanctions Regulations that occurred while the national emergency was in effect may still be carried out.\n\nSANCTIONS TRANSITION UNDER THE GLOBAL MAGNITSKY PROGRAM\n\nEmmerson Mnangagwa (Mnangagwa) is the President of Zimbabwe and is involved in corrupt activities, in particular those relating to gold and diamond smuggling networks.

Mnangagwa\u2019s reelection was marred by fraud, the deployment of groups who intimidated voters, and the use of government-organized \u201cferret teams.\u201d Since the election, the ferret teams, comprising intelligence, police, and military personnel, have likely been involved in the abduction of up to 12 individuals associated with civil society organizations or opposition parties, including Tapfumanei Masaya, who was found dead on November 13, 2023. Abductees report being pushed into vehicles, beaten and stripped naked, injected with unknown substances, threatened with retaliation, and later dumped on the roadside outside of Harare. In 2019, ferret teams reportedly abducted and assaulted more than 50 people. Opposition supporters also claim to have been tortured by security officials, including being stripped, beaten, and whipped at a Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) station.\n\nChiwenga, who has been Zimbabwe\u2019s Vice President since 2018, was originally listed in the Annex to E.O. 13288 of March 6, 2003 and the Annex to E.O. 13391 on November 23, 2005. Chiwenga is designated pursuant to E.O. 13818 for being a foreign person who is or has been a leader or official of an entity, including any government entity, that has engaged in, or whose members have engaged in, serious human rights abuse relating to the leader\u2019s or official\u2019s tenure.\n\nZimbabwe\u2019s Defense Minister Oppah Muchinguri (Muchinguri) is responsible for overseeing Zimbabwe\u2019s Defense Forces and is the chair of the national Joint Operation Command.

She is designated pursuant to E.O. 13818 for being a foreign person who is or has been a leader or official of an entity, including any government entity, that has engaged in, or whose members have engaged in, serious human rights abuse relating to the leader\u2019s or official\u2019s tenure.\n\nGodwin Matanga (Matanga) is the Commissioner-General of the ZRP.

Under his leadership, ZRP members have engaged in the violent oppression of political opposition.\n\nOFAC designated Mutamba on September 15, 2022 pursuant to E.O. 13469 for his role in undermining Zimbabwe\u2019s democratic processes and institutions. He is designated pursuant to E.O. 13818 for being a foreign person who is or has been a leader or official of an entity, including any government entity, that has engaged in, or whose members have engaged in, serious human rights abuse relating to the leader\u2019s or official\u2019s tenure.\n\nWalter Tapfumaneyi (Tapfumaneyi) has been the Deputy Director General of Zimbabwe\u2019s Central Intelligence Organization (CIO) since 2020. He reportedly answers directly to Mnangagwa, and led the campaign to disrupt the 2023 electoral process through his leadership of ruling party-affiliated groups. He is also alleged to have been personally involved in past kidnappings.\n\nTapfumaneyi is designated pursuant to E.O. 13818 for being a foreign person who is or has been a leader or official of an entity, including any government entity, that has engaged in, or whose members have engaged in, serious human rights abuse relating to the leader\u2019s or official\u2019s tenure.\n\nOwen Ncube (Ncube) was Zimbabwe\u2019s Minister of State Security from 2018 to 2022, during which time he ordered security services to identify, abduct, and mistreat individuals assessed to be supporters of a Zimbabwean opposition group. He was recently reappointed to government as the Minister of State for Midlands Provincial Affairs. He is reported to lead a notoriously violent group that is alleged to be responsible for attacks and killings around Kwekwe, Zimbabwe.\n\nNcube was designated on March 11, 2020 pursuant to E.O. 13469 for being responsible for, or participating in, human rights abuses related to political repression in Zimbabwe. Ncube is designated pursuant to E.O. 13818 for being a foreign person that is responsible for or complicit in, or has directly or indirectly engaged in, serious human rights abuse.\n\nSANCTIONS IMPLICATIONS\n\nBuilding upon the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, E.O. 13818 was issued on December 20, 2017, in recognition that the prevalence of human rights abuse and corruption that have their source, in whole or in substantial part, outside the United States, had reached such scope and gravity as to threaten the stability of international political and economic systems. Human rights abuse and corruption undermine the values that form an essential foundation of stable, secure, and functioning societies; have devastating impacts on individuals; weaken democratic institutions; degrade the rule of law; perpetuate violent conflicts; facilitate the activities of dangerous persons; and undermine economic markets. The United States seeks to impose tangible and significant consequences on those who commit serious human rights abuse or engage in corruption, as well as to protect the financial system of the United States from abuse by these same persons.\n\nAs a result of today\u2019s Global Magnitsky action, all property and interests in property of the designated persons described above that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked and must be reported to OFAC. In addition, any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, individually or in the aggregate, 50 percent or more by one or more blocked persons are also blocked. Unless authorized by a general or specific license issued by OFAC, or exempt, OFAC\u2019s regulations generally prohibit all transactions by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in property of designated or otherwise blocked persons.\n\nIn addition, financial institutions and other persons that engage in certain transactions or activities with the sanctioned entities and individuals may expose themselves to sanctions or be subject to an enforcement action. The prohibitions include the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any designated person, or the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.\n\nThe power and integrity of OFAC sanctions derive not only from OFAC\u2019s ability to designate and add persons to the SDN List, but also from its willingness to remove persons from the SDN List consistent with the law. This transition in sanctions authorities demonstrates OFAC\u2019s commitment to review and assess sanctions to ensure the integrity of designations and provides a clear and targeted approach to hold egregious human rights offenders and corrupt actors accountable. The ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish, but to bring about a positive change in behavior. This sanctions transition is an opportunity for those designated to acknowledge their responsibility for sanctionable conduct and take steps to correct their behavior.\n\nFor information concerning the process for seeking removal from an OFAC list, including the SDN List, please refer to OFAC\u2019s Frequently Asked Question 897 here. For detailed information on the process to submit a request for removal from an OFAC sanctions list, please click here.\n\nClick here for more information on the individuals and entities designated today.\n\n###",

        "text": "What the 2024 US Presidential Election Portends for the IPEF Supply Chain Agreement\nSYNOPSIS\n\nThe Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) Supply Chain Agreement signed by its fourteen members in November 2023 entered into force on 24 February. However, US leadership of the IPEF and the Agreement seems uncertain should Donald Trump make a return to the White House after the US Presidential Election in November. Should we be concerned?\n\nCOMMENTARY\n\nSince the signing of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) Supply Chain Agreement in November 2023, five members, viz., Fiji, India, Japan, Singapore, and the United States have ratified it. Their ratifications were sufficient to put this Agreement into force on 24 February 2024. According to Article 21.3, the Agreement shall be in effect 30 days after at least five signatories (out of the 14 member countries) have submitted the \u201cinstrument of ratification, acceptance, or approval with the Depositary\u201d.\n\nThe IPEF and Its Benefits\n\nSome background on the IPEF would be useful. Although not a free trade agreement, IPEF members have embraced it for the tangible benefits that it offers.\n\nFirstly, some of the Asian members see the IPEF as a means to keep the US engaged economically given Washington\u2019s current domestic politics which renders FTAs infeasible. In other words, the IPEF serves as a platform for the US (which launched the initiative) and the Indo-Pacific nations to deepen their economic ties in the realms beyond the issue of market access.\n\nSecondly, the IPEF provides a channel of communication for the members to share concerns and explore solutions to pressing transnational issues. This reduces misunderstandings of one another\u2019s actions, which is crucial in preventing economic conflicts from escalating into trade wars at a time of rising geopolitical tensions and international mistrust.\n\nThirdly, the IPEF will open the door for new ideas and approaches to promote regional trade and investments and help advance economic integration against a backdrop of increasing international uncertainties. The IPEF\u2019s Supply Chain Agreement is a case in point. The Agreement constitutes the world\u2019s first multilateral agreement on supply chain management, which is also applicable in times of crisis.\n\nThe IPEF Supply Chain Agreement\n\nThe IPEF\u2019s Supply Chain Agreement establishes three institutional mechanisms, viz., the Supply Chain Council, Supply Chain Crisis Response Network, and Labour Rights Advisory Board. The Council develops a sector-specific action plan for critical sectors and key products, which is necessary for not only running transnational supply chains in business-as-usual periods but also for elevating the region\u2019s ability to weather crises. The Crisis Response Network provides a medium of communication during supply chain disruptions and emergencies to facilitate information sharing and expedite effective collective action by the involved parties.\n\nOverall, as set out in Article 2, the IPEF Supply Chain Agreement stipulates rules to enable better multilateral supply chain collaboration, such as in aligning guidance related to trade facilitation, sharing of best practices, building the databases of product and logistics data, encouraging the development and adoption of interoperable digital standards, and facilitating business matching, capacity-building, joint research and development.\n\nThese rules will enhance the members\u2019 ability to withstand or reduce the effects of unanticipated disruptions on their economies. As an illustration, most states know the products that they are exporting and importing. However, they are less data-savvy about where their trading partners source the materials, parts, and components for their goods. The Agreement enables the participating countries to exchange such information with one another and to devise well-rounded responses on a timely basis, which will in turn strengthen transnational supply chain resilience.\n\nFor some of the IPEF members, the Agreement provides certain strategic advantages. For example, it enables them to diversify from or reduce their dependence on China for supplies. This objective is driven by reasons such as the disruption to their supply chains caused by Chinese lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic, their intention to establish themselves as an alternative production hub, and Chinese dominance on supply chains for key raw materials and critical minerals.\n\nThe IPEF Under a New Trump Administration\n\nWashington is now in its presidential election mode. The prevailing mood is not favouring free trade as some presidential contenders have made voters more skeptical of multilateralism. For example, Donald Trump has dubbed the IPEF as \u201cTrans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) Two\u201d, which indicates the possibility that he might take the US out of this deal should he get re-elected. It should not be forgotten that it was under his Presidency that the US withdrew from the TPP in 2017. Will history repeat itself?\n\nHowever, Trump may not be able to transform his words into deeds this time, at least during the first half of his four-year term. According to Article 23.1 of the IPEF Supply Chain Agreement, a member is allowed to leave the deal after three years from the date of entry into force of the Agreement. Thus, the soonest the US can exit, if it wants to at all, will be on 25 February 2027.\n\nDomestic political factors may also block Trump from exiting the IPEF. The pact benefits the US private sector and jives well with Washington\u2019s goal to shore up its domestic manufacturing sector, which is now booming. To enable this trend to continue, the US needs to work with like-minded countries to source inputs and ensure the smooth running of transnational supply chains. Thus, American companies and trade associations may put intense pressure on Trump to remain in the IPEF and its Supply Chain Agreement.\n\nHowever, we are still not out of the woods yet. While Trump may be dissuaded from taking the US out of the IPEF, he may still be able to stop the country from participating in the Supply Chain Agreement. For one thing, he may invoke Article 15 of the Agreement, which stipulates that \u201c[n]othing in this Agreement shall be construed to preclude a Party from applying measures that it considers necessary for the fulfillment of its obligations with respect to the maintenance or restoration of international peace or security or for the protection of its own essential security interests\u201d.\n\nFurthermore, dispute settlement under Article 19 of the Agreement is based on consultations, which allows a member to raise concerns about another country\u2019s implementation of a provision of the Agreement. The article requires that the \u201cconsulting Parties shall attempt to arrive at a mutually satisfactory resolution as soon as practicable\u201d. This kind of mechanism may not be effective in ensuring Washington\u2019s compliance or deterring it from defection.\n\nAlternatives to US Leadership\n\nOne element driving the success of the IPEF Supply Chain Agreement so far has been US leadership. Washington has not only played a key role in crafting the details of the text and providing guidance for the other members but also in giving technical assistance to boost their capabilities in implementing the Agreement.\n\nAs part of this assistance, Washington plans to organise a series of training programmes pertaining to supply chain monitoring and operation, launch an IPEF STEM Exchange Program to match early- and mid-career professionals from IPEF countries with professional development opportunities related to supply chain operations, lead up to ten trade missions to IPEF economies over the next five years to assist business matching, and tighten counter-terrorism measures via new Mutual Recognition Arrangements (MRAs) with IPEF countries which currently do not have MRAs with the US Customs Trade Partnership Against Terrorism programme.\n\nIn the operationalisation of the IPEF and its Supply Chain Agreement, the US is expected to provide leadership. However, should Washington be unable to provide this leadership, two questions will arise: \u201cWill the cooperation fall apart?\u201d and \u201cWho else will provide leadership?\u201d\n\nSome IPEF members look to be potential candidates to drive the Supply Chain Agreement forward in the absence of US leadership. Australia and South Korea are two such members who can step up to fill the leadership role. Both nations had previously agreed to jointly craft a scheme to bolster the other IPEF members\u2019 capacities to identify, monitor and manage vital supply chain vulnerabilities.\n\nAnother candidate could be Singapore which was the first IPEF country that Washington chose to conduct pilot projects on digital shipping cooperation with. The city-state\u2019s expertise in digitalised handling of shipping and logistics data would allow it to enhance the capabilities of the other IPEF members in this respect.\n\nThe fate of the IPEF and its Supply Chain Agreement may take a turn for the worse after the US presidential election in November. History may repeat itself and the US may not be able to provide leadership as it once did. Although this is regrettable, there is no reason for despair as alternative leaders are available to helm the IPEF and see through the promotion of trade and investment in the Indo-Pacific.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nKaewkamol Pitakdumrongkit is Senior Fellow and Head of the Centre for Multilateralism Studies at S.

        "text": "How does the Republican Party pick its presidential nominee?\nClick to expand\n\nA very quick guide to the Republican Primaries Donald Trump is running again to be US president and voting on Super Tuesday, 5 March, will help decide whether he beats his opponent, Nikki Haley, to become the Republican Party\u2019s nominee. The winner will go on to face the sitting president, Democrat Joe Biden, in the 2024 election in November.\n\nThere are two main parties in US politics The liberal Democrats are currently in the White House and the conservative Republicans are in opposition. Democrats tend to believe in bigger government support and spending while Republicans typically call for lower spending and stripping back the state.\n\nChoosing a Republican Party nominee takes nearly two years Trump has been a leading figure in the Republican Party since becoming president in 2016, but he lost to Biden in 2020. For this 2024 election, Republicans need to pick a candidate - a process called the primaries. Biden is not facing any serious opposition for the Democrat nomination.\n\nPrimaries are a series of state elections and then a national conference Each state holds an election to vote on who they want as party nominee and the overall winner is officially crowned at the Republican National Convention (RNC) - a big political event in July 2024.\n\nA state can pick its preferred candidate in two ways Nearly all the states hold their primary elections in the same way - a secret ballot, like a general election. A small number of states have a caucus which is a head count or a show of hands. The states have different rules on who can vote - often only Republican Party members. Based on how many votes they win, the candidates get a certain number of delegates who represent them at the convention.\n\nVoting started with the Iowa caucus in January This was shortly followed by the New Hampshire primary. More primary elections have been held in South Carolina, Michigan and Washington DC, and caucuses in Nevada and the Virgin Islands. Donald Trump currently has 244 delegates and Nikki Haley 43 delegates.\n\nSuper Tuesday is the biggest day for voting On 5 March, there will be Republican party elections across 15 states, including the ones with most people - California and Texas \u2013 and in the US territory of American Samoa. With 865 of 2,429 delegates up for grabs, it is often the point when a likely winner emerges. If Trump has a good night, he will be very close to winning outright.\n\nTrump skipped the TV debates this time Millions usually tune in to watch the presidential hopefuls discuss policy and trade insults. The first Republican debates began in August 2023 with a large range of candidates, but interest has not been as high because they've happened without the most popular candidate, Donald Trump. He refused to promise to back whoever wins the primaries and said he doesn\u2019t need to face his rivals on stage.\n\nTrump is the favourite to win the Republican race He remains the likely winner after triumphing in all the early states. A busy few months lie ahead for Mr Trump as he runs for the White House while also facing a number of criminal charges, including attempting to overturn the 2020 election results. He denies wrongdoing and says the indictments are political. Even if he was convicted or jailed, he could stay in the race for the White House.",

        "text": "What Is Joe Biden\u2019s Net Worth in 2024?\nYuri Gripas / Pool via CNP/SplashNews.com / Yuri Gripas / Pool via CNP/SplashNews.com\n\nTwo things you can always count on during a presidential election are plenty of verbal fireworks and false claims about the candidates. The 2024 presidential campaign has delivered both in large doses. One of the false claims, issued late last year, had to do with President Joe Biden\u2019s net worth.\n\nLearn More: Here\u2019s How Much Every Living US President Is Worth: Where Does Biden Rank?\n\nFind Out: 6 Genius Things All Wealthy People Do With Their Money\n\nAs PolitiFact reported, actor James Woods in December shared an image on X (formerly Twitter) claiming that Biden\u2019s net worth had increased from $9 million in 2019 to $41 million in 2022. Net worth equals the value of income and assets minus debt and other liabilities.\n\nWoods has been a vocal supporter of former President Donald Trump, the frontrunner to win the Republican nomination this year and face Biden in the November general election. \u201cI\u2019m shocked,\u201d Woods reportedly wrote on X. The implication, of course, is that Biden\u2019s wealth more than quadrupled during his time in the White House \u2014 something that would certainly raise eyebrows.\n\nBut it turns out that Woods\u2019 claim was way off \u2014 by about $30 million. PolitiFact rated it as \u201cfalse.\u201d Meanwhile, Woods seems to have taken that post down.\n\nSponsored: Protect Your Wealth With A Gold IRA. Take advantage of the timeless appeal of gold in a Gold IRA recommended by Sean Hannity.\n\nJoe Biden\u2019s Net Worth\n\nBiden\u2019s actual net worth is about $10 million, according to Forbes, which referred to him as \u201cMiddle-Class Joe\u201d (though, in fairness, there\u2019s nothing \u201cmiddle class\u201d about being worth $10 million).\n\nPolitiFact referred to Biden as one of Congress\u2019 \u201cleast wealthy members\u201d before he became vice-president under President Barack Obama and then president himself. As president, Biden\u2019s wealth has increased from about $8 million when he took office to about $10 million.\n\nBut as Forbes pointed out, the increase has \u201cnothing to do with family business dealings in far-flung countries,\u201d as some of Biden\u2019s political opponents have claimed. Instead, Forbes wrote, Biden is \u201cgetting richer by doing what a lot of 80-year-old Americans are doing: sitting on real estate.\u201d The president owns two homes in Delaware worth an estimated $7 million combined. Thanks to the red-hot housing market in recent years, those homes are now worth nearly $1.8 million more than they were when Biden took office.\n\nForbes also noted that Biden has long been interested in real estate. In his mid-20s, he bought three houses and 85 acres in Maryland with the goal of one day turning the property into a family compound. Before that, he turned them into rental properties. Rather than live there himself, Biden and his family lived rent-free in a nearby cottage in exchange for managing a local pool.\n\nStory Continues",

The restrictions had been imposed after what Washington said were \"illegitimate\" elections in 2018.\n\nIn January, the US threatened to reinstate the sanctions, after Venezuela's top court upheld a ban on opposition candidate Ms Machado.\n\nVenezuela has the world's largest proven oil reserves.",

The message was followed by a fundraising email sent to supporters of his campaign.\n\nSpeaking from his estate in Mar-a-Lago, Florida, soon afterwards, he said that the decision was \"very well crafted\" and will \"go a long way towards bringing our country together, which it needs\".\n\n\"You can't take someone out of a race because an opponent would like it that way,\" Mr Trump added.\n\nColorado's Secretary of State, Jena Griswold, said that she was disappointed by the ruling and that \"Colorado should be able to bar oath-breaking insurrections from our ballot\".\n\nAdditionally, the watchdog group that brought the case in Colorado, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew), said in a statement that while the court \"failed to meet the moment\", it is \"still a win for democracy: Trump will go down in history as an insurrectionist\".",

        "text": "What does the Supreme Court\u2019s latest ruling mean for the 2024 presidential election and beyond? VCU analyst offers insight\nThe Supreme Court unanimously ruled Monday that states cannot remove Donald Trump from this year\u2019s presidential ballot for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attacks on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nJohn Aughenbaugh, Ph.D., a Supreme Court scholar and associate professor in Virginia Commonwealth University\u2019s Department of Political Science, offered insight into the ruling.\n\nWhat did the court actually determine in this ruling?\n\nAll the Supreme Court said was states like Colorado, Maine, Illinois \u2013 which had removed former President Trump from their ballots \u2013 all the Supreme Court said was they can\u2019t. They cannot because the challenges were basically based on the 14th Amendment, Section 3, of the Constitution. The Supreme Court said only the United States Congress, through passing a law, could remove a presidential candidate.\n\nThe election has not been decided. If former President Trump wins enough delegates at the Republican National Convention, he will be the Republican Party nominee in November.\n\nHow might this ruling be seen through a lens of partisanship?\n\nAll nine Supreme Court justices said that what Colorado attempted to do was unconstitutional, so it wasn\u2019t partisan. Now, did all nine agree in regards to the reasoning? No. Five [justices] quite clearly said Congress would have to pass a law defining why former President Trump\u2019s behavior violated Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. Justice Amy Coney Barrett decided the case on \u201cDid Colorado have the constitutional authority to do what it did?\u201d Her answer was no.\n\nThe three liberal justices criticized the per curiam opinion for basically saying the only way to remove somebody from a federal office ballot in a state is Congress passing a law. They would have left the door open as to other means in which somebody like former President Trump could be removed. But it was not a partisan decision.\n\nWhat is a larger takeaway from this ruling with respect to future elections?\n\nMost of us [constitutional law scholars] who read the transcripts or listened to the transcripts from the oral arguments last month are not surprised by the court\u2019s ruling today. I know there have been various commentaries already provided on X and other social media where liberals are very critical of the court. But again, it was a unanimous decision.\n\nIf you listen to the oral arguments from last month, even the liberal justices were taken aback by the problem that would arise \u2013 if what Colorado did was replicated across the country \u2013 because you could have individual states removing presidential candidates from their state ballots. If you just did that in a handful of battleground states, you would effectively determine the outcome of an election \u2013 and that\u2019s pretty awe-inspiring to think about.\n\nI\u2019m not entirely sure that states like Colorado, Maine, Illinois understood that this could be then used by Republican-controlled states in the future. That\u2019s the downside of using unusual or unique legal arguments or legal cases to remove a candidate or candidates from a particular party: Once that precedent is set, then the opposition party could use the same tactics in the future.",

        "text": "How does the US election work?\nFrom primaries to caucuses via the Electoral College, the US election system is full of terminology that can feel unfamiliar when it crops up every four years.\n\nHere, we break down how the US election system works and what all those words mean.\n\nFirst - what are the basics of the US elections?\n\nOn Tuesday 5 November 2024, Americans will go to the polls for the country's presidential election.\n\nBut it is a long run-up to that point, including the primaries and caucuses by which the presidential candidates will be chosen.\n\nThe winner of the presidential election will take office in January 2025 for a four-year term.\n\nHow does the Electoral College system work?\n\nAmericans don't actually vote directly for who they want to be president and vice president.\n\nInstead, they vote for \"electors\" - members of the Electoral College - who back their choice of candidate for those roles.\n\nEach state has a number of electors depending on its population.\n\nCalifornia, which has a population of nearly 40 million, has 55 votes in the Electoral College - while North Dakota, home to about 762,000 people, has just three votes.\n\nThere are a total of 538 electors in total - 435 representatives from Congress, 100 Senators and three additional voters from the District of Columbia.\n\nMost states operate a winner-takes-all system, so if a candidate wins the most votes in a state, they get all the Electoral College votes.\n\nJust two states, Maine and Nebraska, use a proportional system, dividing their Electoral College votes according to how many votes each candidate receives.\n\nThe first candidate to 270 Electoral College votes wins the presidency.\n\nIf no candidate gets an absolute majority then the House of Representatives elects the president.\n\nImage: Pic: AP\n\nWhat does that mean for the popular vote?\n\nBecause of the way the Electoral College system works, the candidate who is most popular with voters may not wind up being elected president.\n\nThis happened in 2016, when Hillary Clinton gained almost three million more votes than Donald Trump - but he won the presidency with 304 Electoral College votes to her 227.\n\nIn 2000, George W Bush won with 271 Electoral College votes, but Democrat candidate Al Gore won the popular vote by more than half a million.\n\nHow is the vice president elected?\n\nThe vice president is also elected through the Electoral College system.\n\nEach elector will cast one vote for president and another for vice president.\n\nPresidential candidates choose who will be their \"running mate\" in line for vice president.\n\nPresident Joe Biden is committed to keeping Kamala Harris, the first woman vice president and vice president of colour, on his ticket for re-election.\n\nFrontrunner for the Republican nomination Donald Trump has name-dropped a number of people when asked about potential running mates, saying he would not make a decision for a \"little while\".\n\nRead more: Who could be the next vice president of the US?\n\nImage: It's likely to be Donald Trump and Joe Biden slogging it out for presidency in November\n\nWhen is the winner announced?\n\nA projected winner is normally announced on election night, but the actual Electoral College vote happens in December when the electors meet in their states.\n\nWhat are swing states and how important are they?\n\nSwing states, also known as battleground or toss-up states, hold disproportionate sway in presidential elections.\n\nAs the name indicates, these are the states that switch between voting Republican and Democrat, because their population is fairly evenly split in support of the two parties.\n\nMillions of dollars are poured into campaigning in swing states as winning the additional college votes can be crucial.\n\nIn 2024, the critical states are likely to include Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. In a November poll, Mr Trump was ahead in all but Wisconsin.\n\nRead more:\n\nWhat are caucuses and why is the first in Iowa so important?\n\nWhat is Super Tuesday? Why one day of the US election matters so much\n\nWhat are primary elections?\n\nPrimaries are like mini-elections to select candidates in the two main parties for the general election.\n\nThey are generally conducted in polling places like other elections, or sometimes by post.\n\nAlthough voters cast ballots for their preferred presidential candidates, it is the delegates to the national party conventions who ultimately select the presidential nominees for each major party.\n\nCandidates are awarded delegates in most states by winning the primary elections and caucuses.\n\nTo get the Republican nomination, a candidate needs to get at least 1,215 delegates. For the Democratic nomination, it's 1,968 delegates.\n\nThe Republican National Convention is in July and the Democratic National Convention is in August.\n\nWhile Joe Biden and Donald Trump are already clear frontrunners, the conventions will be when delegates officially vote for their preferred candidates.\n\nWhat is a caucus?\n\nUnlike primaries, caucuses must be attended in person.\n\nPrimaries are run by the state whereas caucuses are organised by the parties themselves.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:07 How does a caucus work?\n\nCaucuses take place at precinct, district, and state level in places such as schools, churches, and community centres.\n\nCampaign representatives make speeches on behalf of their candidates and caucus-goers vote then and there, with the votes tallied in a matter of hours.\n\nPrimaries and caucuses can be open - with anyone allowed to take part - or closed, meaning only registered party members can vote.\n\nWhat is Super Tuesday?\n\nSuper Tuesday is the biggest day of voting in the US outside of the November election.\n\nIt is the day when the most US states choose who they think should be their candidates for president.\n\nThis year, Super Tuesday saw fifteen states plus the US territory of American Samoa cast their votes for Republican and Democratic candidates.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 0:59 What is Super Tuesday?\n\nWhat are Americans voting for besides president?\n\nVoters will also elect new members of Congress, the legislative branch of the US government which is made up of two parts: the House of Representatives and the Senate.\n\nEach state has two Senators and at least one Representative.\n\nAll 435 seats in the House of Representatives are up for election, while 33 Senate seats will also be decided in November.",

                "description": "New Inflation Reduction Act Provisions Allow State, Local, and Tribal Governments, Tax-Exempt Entities, U.S. Territories, Rural Energy Co-ops, and More to Access Tax Credits for Building a Clean Energy EconomyWASHINGTON \u2014 Today, as part of the Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s Investing in America agenda, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) released final rules on key provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act to expand the reach of the clean energy tax credits and help build projects more quickly and affordably, which will create good-paying jobs and lower energy costs for families.\u00a0The Inflation Reduction Act created two new credit delivery mechanisms\u2014elective pay (otherwise known as \u201cdirect pay\u201d) and transferability\u2014that will help enable state, local, and Tribal governments; non-profit organizations; Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories; and other entities to take advantage of clean energy tax credits. Until the Inflation Reduction Act introduced these new credit delivery mechanisms, governments, many types of tax-exempt organizations, and even many businesses could not fully benefit from tax credits like those that incentivize clean energy deployment. \u00a0\u201cThe Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s new tools to access clean energy tax credits are a catalyst for meeting President Biden\u2019s historic economic and climate goals. They are acting as a force multiplier, bringing governments and nonprofits to the table for the first time and enabling companies to realize greater value from incentives to deploy new clean power and manufacture clean energy components,\u201d said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. \u201cMore clean energy projects are being built quickly and affordably, and more communities are benefitting from the growth of the clean energy economy.\u201d\u201cThanks to President Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act, local governments, nonprofits, and other non-taxable entities can now claim clean energy tax credits for the first time,\u201d\u00a0said John Podesta, Senior Advisor to the President for International Climate Policy. \u201cToday\u2019s final rule provides additional clarity for organizations so they can take full advantage of this game-changing opportunity to expand clean energy all across America.\u201d\u201cPresident Biden\u2019s Investing in America agenda has created game changing opportunities to ensure the health and savings benefits of clean energy solutions transform all aspects of American life,\" said Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm. \u201cEnergy costs are the second-highest expense for nonprofits, and now, for the first-time ever nonprofits, from hospitals to food banks, can amplify their impacts thanks to direct payments for installing clean energy technologies using every dollar saved to reinvest in crucial community services.\u201dThe Inflation Reduction Act allows tax-exempt and governmental entities to receive elective payments for 12 clean energy tax credits, including the major Investment and Production Tax (45 and 48) credits, as well as tax credits for electric vehicles and charging stations. Businesses can also choose elective pay for three of those credits: the credits for Advanced Manufacturing (45X), Carbon Oxide Sequestration (45Q), and Clean Hydrogen (45V).\u00a0The Inflation Reduction Act also allows businesses to transfer all or a portion of any of 11 clean energy credits to a third-party in exchange for tax-free immediate funds, so that businesses can take advantage of tax incentives if they do not have sufficient tax liability to fully utilize the credits themselves. Entities without sufficient tax liability were previously unable to realize the full value of credits, leaving only corporations able to take advantage of federal tax incentives. This raised costs, created challenges for financing projects, and limited the ability of communities and other organizations to realize the full economic and environmental benefits of clean energy. Final rules on transferability will be finalized in the near future.Treasury\u2019s elective pay final rules provide certainty for applicable entities to understand the law\u2019s scope and requirements for eligibility. The final rules also lay out the process and timeline to claim and receive an elective payment.Along with final rules on elective pay, Treasury today also issued a separate Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) that is intended to provide further clarity and flexibility for applicable entities that that co-own clean energy projects and would like to utilize elective pay.Under the IRA, entities treated as partnerships for federal tax purposes are not eligible for elective pay, regardless of whether one or more of its partners is an applicable entity. However, the proposed elective pay regulations clarified -- and the final regulations confirm -- that there are pathways for an applicable entity to access elective pay for credits it earns through a joint ownership arrangement including validly \u201celecting out\u201d of partnership tax treatment. Treasury and IRS agreed with commenters that existing guidance on making a valid election out of partnership tax treatment for clean energy arrangements was limited, and updates were needed for these arrangements to be more effective.The section 761(a) NPRM issued today provides a broader and more accessible pathway for applicable entities that co-own renewable energy projects to elect out of partnership tax status and therefore access elective pay. To qualify under these proposed rules, co-ownership arrangements must be organized exclusively to produce electricity from their applicable credit property, have one or more applicable entity co-owners that will claim elective pay, and meet certain other requirements.Specifically, these proposed regulations would:Permit renewable energy investments to be made through a noncorporate entity, rather than requiring direct co-ownership of the property or facility by the applicable entity;Modify certain joint marketing restrictions to provide that multi-year power purchase agreements would not violate the requirements to elect out of partnership tax treatment.Treasury and IRS welcome written comments submitted through regulations.gov. The comment period is open until May 10, 2024.To facilitate eligible entities receiving a direct payment, transferring a clean energy credit, or claiming a CHIPS credit, the IRS built IRS Energy Credits Online (ECO) for recipients to complete the pre-file registration process and receive a registration number. The registration number must be included on the eligible entity\u2019s annual return when making an elective payment election or transfer election for a clean energy credit. The registration process helps prevent improper payments to fraudulent actors and provides the IRS with basic information to ensure that any entity that qualifies for these credit monetization mechanisms can readily access these benefits upon filing a return and making an elective payment election.###",

        "text": "U.S. Department of the Treasury, IRS Release Final Rules on Provisions to Expand Reach of Clean Energy Tax Credits Through President Biden\u2019s Investing in America Agenda\nNew Inflation Reduction Act Provisions Allow State, Local, and Tribal Governments, Tax-Exempt Entities, U.S. Territories, Rural Energy Co-ops, and More to Access Tax Credits for Building a Clean Energy Economy\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Today, as part of the Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s Investing in America agenda, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) released final rules on key provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act to expand the reach of the clean energy tax credits and help build projects more quickly and affordably, which will create good-paying jobs and lower energy costs for families.\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act created two new credit delivery mechanisms\u2014elective pay (otherwise known as \u201cdirect pay\u201d) and transferability\u2014that will help enable state, local, and Tribal governments; non-profit organizations; Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories; and other entities to take advantage of clean energy tax credits. Until the Inflation Reduction Act introduced these new credit delivery mechanisms, governments, many types of tax-exempt organizations, and even many businesses could not fully benefit from tax credits like those that incentivize clean energy deployment.\n\n\u201cThe Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s new tools to access clean energy tax credits are a catalyst for meeting President Biden\u2019s historic economic and climate goals. They are acting as a force multiplier, bringing governments and nonprofits to the table for the first time and enabling companies to realize greater value from incentives to deploy new clean power and manufacture clean energy components,\u201d said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. \u201cMore clean energy projects are being built quickly and affordably, and more communities are benefitting from the growth of the clean energy economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks to President Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act, local governments, nonprofits, and other non-taxable entities can now claim clean energy tax credits for the first time,\u201d said John Podesta, Senior Advisor to the President for International Climate Policy. \u201cToday\u2019s final rule provides additional clarity for organizations so they can take full advantage of this game-changing opportunity to expand clean energy all across America.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Biden\u2019s Investing in America agenda has created game changing opportunities to ensure the health and savings benefits of clean energy solutions transform all aspects of American life,\" said Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm. \u201cEnergy costs are the second-highest expense for nonprofits, and now, for the first-time ever nonprofits, from hospitals to food banks, can amplify their impacts thanks to direct payments for installing clean energy technologies using every dollar saved to reinvest in crucial community services.\u201d\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act allows tax-exempt and governmental entities to receive elective payments for 12 clean energy tax credits, including the major Investment and Production Tax (45 and 48) credits, as well as tax credits for electric vehicles and charging stations. Businesses can also choose elective pay for three of those credits: the credits for Advanced Manufacturing (45X), Carbon Oxide Sequestration (45Q), and Clean Hydrogen (45V).\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act also allows businesses to transfer all or a portion of any of 11 clean energy credits to a third-party in exchange for tax-free immediate funds, so that businesses can take advantage of tax incentives if they do not have sufficient tax liability to fully utilize the credits themselves. Entities without sufficient tax liability were previously unable to realize the full value of credits, leaving only corporations able to take advantage of federal tax incentives. This raised costs, created challenges for financing projects, and limited the ability of communities and other organizations to realize the full economic and environmental benefits of clean energy. Final rules on transferability will be finalized in the near future.\n\nTreasury\u2019s elective pay final rules provide certainty for applicable entities to understand the law\u2019s scope and requirements for eligibility. The final rules also lay out the process and timeline to claim and receive an elective payment.\n\nAlong with final rules on elective pay, Treasury today also issued a separate Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) that is intended to provide further clarity and flexibility for applicable entities that that co-own clean energy projects and would like to utilize elective pay.\n\nUnder the IRA, entities treated as partnerships for federal tax purposes are not eligible for elective pay, regardless of whether one or more of its partners is an applicable entity. However, the proposed elective pay regulations clarified -- and the final regulations confirm -- that there are pathways for an applicable entity to access elective pay for credits it earns through a joint ownership arrangement including validly \u201celecting out\u201d of partnership tax treatment. Treasury and IRS agreed with commenters that existing guidance on making a valid election out of partnership tax treatment for clean energy arrangements was limited, and updates were needed for these arrangements to be more effective.\n\nThe section 761(a) NPRM issued today provides a broader and more accessible pathway for applicable entities that co-own renewable energy projects to elect out of partnership tax status and therefore access elective pay. To qualify under these proposed rules, co-ownership arrangements must be organized exclusively to produce electricity from their applicable credit property, have one or more applicable entity co-owners that will claim elective pay, and meet certain other requirements.\n\nSpecifically, these proposed regulations would:\n\nPermit renewable energy investments to be made through a noncorporate entity, rather than requiring direct co-ownership of the property or facility by the applicable entity;\n\nModify certain joint marketing restrictions to provide that multi-year power purchase agreements would not violate the requirements to elect out of partnership tax treatment.\n\nTreasury and IRS welcome written comments submitted through regulations.gov. The comment period is open until May 10, 2024.\n\nTo facilitate eligible entities receiving a direct payment, transferring a clean energy credit, or claiming a CHIPS credit, the IRS built IRS Energy Credits Online (ECO) for recipients to complete the pre-file registration process and receive a registration number. The registration number must be included on the eligible entity\u2019s annual return when making an elective payment election or transfer election for a clean energy credit. The registration process helps prevent improper payments to fraudulent actors and provides the IRS with basic information to ensure that any entity that qualifies for these credit monetization mechanisms can readily access these benefits upon filing a return and making an elective payment election.\n\n###",

It is highly likely that the 2024 U.S. presidential election will look a lot like a rematch of the one from 2020 with President Biden and former President Trump competing for the White House.\n\nSuper Tuesday marks an important milestone in the race for the presidency as it traditionally narrows down the race to the final Republican and Democratic candidates. It is important to be cognizant of the \u2018noise\u2019 that elections can create on markets during election season and methodically keep it apart from the more long-term drivers of equity market fundamentals which stems from movements in bottom-line earnings and company growth.\n\nKey messages:",

In this election, voters help select a presidential candidate to represent their party in the November General Election. If you are registered with a qualified political party, you will receive a ballot with presidential candidates for your party only.\n\nIf you are not registered with a qualified political party, you are a \u201cNo Party Preference\" (NPP) voter and will receive a ballot without presidential candidates.\n\nIf you are a NPP voter and want to vote for a presidential candidate, you may request a ballot for a party that allows crossover voting for the Primary Election only. Parties that allow this are:\n\n\u2022 American Independent Party \u2022 Democratic Party \u2022\u200b Libertarian Party\n\n\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200bVoters that \u201ccrossover\" are not re-registered with this party. After the election you will still be registered as NPP. The Voter Registration and Elections Office (VRE) is mailing crossover cards to NPP voters beginning this week. Complete and return the card if you would like to request a crossover ballot.\n\nVisit our website for more information on How to Vote for US President.If you are a NPP voter and want to vote for a presidential candidate in the Green Party or Peace and Freedom Party or Republican Party, you must re-register with that specific party. To change your voter registration, visit registertovote.ca.gov.\n\nThe registration deadline for the March Presidential Primary is February 20, 2024. After this date you may register and vote a Conditional Voter Registration (CVR) ballot at the VRE office or any Vote Center. The VRE office is open for voting beginning Monday, February 5, 2024.

        "text": "\u2018People Are Exhausted by Politics\u2019: Faculty Assess the 2024 Election at Briefing for International Journalists\nThis story was first published on Duke Today and was written by Eric Ferreri. Photos by Trey Mathews.\n\nIt\u2019s just early March, and voters may already be sick of the election.\n\nThe inevitable November showdown between President Joe Biden and his presumptive opponent, former President Donald Trump, is so constant, ill-mannered and ubiquitous in news and social media it may tire out voters far before they cast a single vote, several Duke political experts said Monday.\n\nAnd that fatigue may tamp down voter turnout.\n\nImage Philip Napoli, a public policy professor and director of Duke\u2019s DeWitt Wallace Center for Media & Democracy.\n\n\u201cWe have reached an extent of polarization in this country, combined with a complicated media environment, where people are exhausted by politics,\u201d said Sunshine Hillygus, a professor of political science and public policy and director of the Duke Initiative on Survey Methodology. \u201cWe see increasing numbers of people who don\u2019t identify with either party. We see increasing numbers of young people disillusioned with politics generally.\u201d\n\nThe result, Hillygus added, may be that only the most overzealous voting blocs head to the polls in droves.\n\n\u201cThe risk that we face is we\u2019re going to have active participation among the more extreme portions of the public and fewer of the people who are the majority of the moderate Americans participating in the process and having their voices heard,\u201d she said.\n\nHillygus joined four colleagues Monday for a media briefing with a group of international journalists visiting Duke. The conversation ranged from voting tendencies to young voter turnout, election security, misinformation and other issues.\n\nVoter exhaustion may be particularly acute among young people who see this presidential race as simply more of the same, said Deondra Rose, a public policy professor and director of Duke\u2019s Polis: Center for Politics.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m feeling a little bit of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu this primary season and I think we\u2019re gearing up for an election cycle with voter exhaustion,\u201d Rose said. \u201cThey\u2019re seeing the same candidates over and over, so (to get young people interested), it\u2019s about moving past the horse race \u2026 and emphasizing the importance of participating in democracy. Self-governance means very little if people don\u2019t participate.\u201d\n\nJudith Kelley, dean of the Sanford School of Public Policy and an international election expert, said this year\u2019s presidential election will be under a microscope.",

She has now dropped out of the race.",

The restrictions had been imposed after what Washington said were \"illegitimate\" elections in 2018.\n\nIn January, the US threatened to reinstate the sanctions, after Venezuela's top court upheld a ban on opposition candidate Ms Machado.\n\nVenezuela has the world's largest proven oil reserves.",

        "text": "With one candidate left, Alaska Democrats\u2019 plan is to set presidential preference by voice vote \u2022 Alaska Beacon\nWith President Joe Biden the only candidate left seeking the Democratic nomination in Alaska, the state party plan is to hold a voice vote in caucuses to decide on the party nomination rather than have party members cast electronic ballots in a primary. Party leadership said it would confirm the plan with the national party.\n\nMinnesota Rep. Dean Phillips, Biden\u2019s last remaining rival for the nomination, suspended his campaign on Wednesday after receiving low vote counts in every primary held so far, including his home state.\n\nUnder a revised plan submitted to the National Democratic Party in late February, party members will begin the process of selecting delegates on April 13. If there were multiple active candidates who qualified for the ballot, then party members would vote by electronic ballots in a party-run primary.\n\nBut in the case of only one active candidate, the party plan is to have party members in each Alaska House district hold a voice vote on April 13 in caucuses.\n\nParty Executive Director Lindsay Kavanaugh said that most districts have the capacity for people to call into a party meeting to vote remotely.\n\n\u201cAll Alaska Democrats are invited to participate,\u201d Kavanaugh said of the vote.\n\nWhile the proportion of the delegates who each candidate would receive will be determined on April 13, the actual delegates will be picked at a state party convention on May 18 in Juneau, according to party rules.\n\nThose delegates will attend the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August.\n\nWhile Democrats in some states have been voting for the option of having delegates who are not committed to voting for Biden, the party in Alaska does not have an option to vote \u201cuncommitted\u201d under party rules.\n\nPhillips would have needed 15% of the vote to receive any Alaska delegates under party rules. In the 18 nominating contests held so far, he only cleared that bar in New Hampshire, the only state where Biden\u2019s name did not appear on the ballot.\n\nSome national news sites incorrectly list April 6 as the date of the Alaska party primary. That date was listed in an older version of the state party delegate selection plan. The April 13 date was picked by the party and included in the current plan.",

        "text": "How does the US election work?\nFrom primaries to caucuses via the Electoral College, the US election system is full of terminology that can feel unfamiliar when it crops up every four years.\n\nHere, we break down how the US election system works and what all those words mean.\n\nFirst - what are the basics of the US elections?\n\nOn Tuesday 5 November 2024, Americans will go to the polls for the country's presidential election.\n\nBut it is a long run-up to that point, including the primaries and caucuses by which the presidential candidates will be chosen.\n\nThe winner of the presidential election will take office in January 2025 for a four-year term.\n\nHow does the Electoral College system work?\n\nAmericans don't actually vote directly for who they want to be president and vice president.\n\nInstead, they vote for \"electors\" - members of the Electoral College - who back their choice of candidate for those roles.\n\nEach state has a number of electors depending on its population.\n\nCalifornia, which has a population of nearly 40 million, has 55 votes in the Electoral College - while North Dakota, home to about 762,000 people, has just three votes.\n\nThere are a total of 538 electors in total - 435 representatives from Congress, 100 Senators and three additional voters from the District of Columbia.\n\nMost states operate a winner-takes-all system, so if a candidate wins the most votes in a state, they get all the Electoral College votes.\n\nJust two states, Maine and Nebraska, use a proportional system, dividing their Electoral College votes according to how many votes each candidate receives.\n\nThe first candidate to 270 Electoral College votes wins the presidency.\n\nIf no candidate gets an absolute majority then the House of Representatives elects the president.\n\nImage: Pic: AP\n\nWhat does that mean for the popular vote?\n\nBecause of the way the Electoral College system works, the candidate who is most popular with voters may not wind up being elected president.\n\nThis happened in 2016, when Hillary Clinton gained almost three million more votes than Donald Trump - but he won the presidency with 304 Electoral College votes to her 227.\n\nIn 2000, George W Bush won with 271 Electoral College votes, but Democrat candidate Al Gore won the popular vote by more than half a million.\n\nHow is the vice president elected?\n\nThe vice president is also elected through the Electoral College system.\n\nEach elector will cast one vote for president and another for vice president.\n\nPresidential candidates choose who will be their \"running mate\" in line for vice president.\n\nPresident Joe Biden is committed to keeping Kamala Harris, the first woman vice president and vice president of colour, on his ticket for re-election.\n\nFrontrunner for the Republican nomination Donald Trump has name-dropped a number of people when asked about potential running mates, saying he would not make a decision for a \"little while\".\n\nRead more: Who could be the next vice president of the US?\n\nImage: It's likely to be Donald Trump and Joe Biden slogging it out for presidency in November\n\nWhen is the winner announced?\n\nA projected winner is normally announced on election night, but the actual Electoral College vote happens in December when the electors meet in their states.\n\nWhat are swing states and how important are they?\n\nSwing states, also known as battleground or toss-up states, hold disproportionate sway in presidential elections.\n\nAs the name indicates, these are the states that switch between voting Republican and Democrat, because their population is fairly evenly split in support of the two parties.\n\nMillions of dollars are poured into campaigning in swing states as winning the additional college votes can be crucial.\n\nIn 2024, the critical states are likely to include Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. In a November poll, Mr Trump was ahead in all but Wisconsin.\n\nRead more:\n\nWhat are caucuses and why is the first in Iowa so important?\n\nWhat is Super Tuesday? Why one day of the US election matters so much\n\nWhat are primary elections?\n\nPrimaries are like mini-elections to select candidates in the two main parties for the general election.\n\nThey are generally conducted in polling places like other elections, or sometimes by post.\n\nAlthough voters cast ballots for their preferred presidential candidates, it is the delegates to the national party conventions who ultimately select the presidential nominees for each major party.\n\nCandidates are awarded delegates in most states by winning the primary elections and caucuses.\n\nTo get the Republican nomination, a candidate needs to get at least 1,215 delegates. For the Democratic nomination, it's 1,968 delegates.\n\nThe Republican National Convention is in July and the Democratic National Convention is in August.\n\nWhile Joe Biden and Donald Trump are already clear frontrunners, the conventions will be when delegates officially vote for their preferred candidates.\n\nWhat is a caucus?\n\nUnlike primaries, caucuses must be attended in person.\n\nPrimaries are run by the state whereas caucuses are organised by the parties themselves.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:07 How does a caucus work?\n\nCaucuses take place at precinct, district, and state level in places such as schools, churches, and community centres.\n\nCampaign representatives make speeches on behalf of their candidates and caucus-goers vote then and there, with the votes tallied in a matter of hours.\n\nPrimaries and caucuses can be open - with anyone allowed to take part - or closed, meaning only registered party members can vote.\n\nWhat is Super Tuesday?\n\nSuper Tuesday is the biggest day of voting in the US outside of the November election.\n\nIt is the day when the most US states choose who they think should be their candidates for president.\n\nThis year, Super Tuesday saw fifteen states plus the US territory of American Samoa cast their votes for Republican and Democratic candidates.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 0:59 What is Super Tuesday?\n\nWhat are Americans voting for besides president?\n\nVoters will also elect new members of Congress, the legislative branch of the US government which is made up of two parts: the House of Representatives and the Senate.\n\nEach state has two Senators and at least one Representative.\n\nAll 435 seats in the House of Representatives are up for election, while 33 Senate seats will also be decided in November.",

                "description": "New Inflation Reduction Act Provisions Allow State, Local, and Tribal Governments, Tax-Exempt Entities, U.S. Territories, Rural Energy Co-ops, and More to Access Tax Credits for Building a Clean Energy EconomyWASHINGTON \u2014 Today, as part of the Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s Investing in America agenda, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) released final rules on key provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act to expand the reach of the clean energy tax credits and help build projects more quickly and affordably, which will create good-paying jobs and lower energy costs for families.\u00a0The Inflation Reduction Act created two new credit delivery mechanisms\u2014elective pay (otherwise known as \u201cdirect pay\u201d) and transferability\u2014that will help enable state, local, and Tribal governments; non-profit organizations; Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories; and other entities to take advantage of clean energy tax credits. Until the Inflation Reduction Act introduced these new credit delivery mechanisms, governments, many types of tax-exempt organizations, and even many businesses could not fully benefit from tax credits like those that incentivize clean energy deployment. \u00a0\u201cThe Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s new tools to access clean energy tax credits are a catalyst for meeting President Biden\u2019s historic economic and climate goals. They are acting as a force multiplier, bringing governments and nonprofits to the table for the first time and enabling companies to realize greater value from incentives to deploy new clean power and manufacture clean energy components,\u201d said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. \u201cMore clean energy projects are being built quickly and affordably, and more communities are benefitting from the growth of the clean energy economy.\u201d\u201cThanks to President Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act, local governments, nonprofits, and other non-taxable entities can now claim clean energy tax credits for the first time,\u201d\u00a0said John Podesta, Senior Advisor to the President for International Climate Policy. \u201cToday\u2019s final rule provides additional clarity for organizations so they can take full advantage of this game-changing opportunity to expand clean energy all across America.\u201d\u201cPresident Biden\u2019s Investing in America agenda has created game changing opportunities to ensure the health and savings benefits of clean energy solutions transform all aspects of American life,\" said Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm. \u201cEnergy costs are the second-highest expense for nonprofits, and now, for the first-time ever nonprofits, from hospitals to food banks, can amplify their impacts thanks to direct payments for installing clean energy technologies using every dollar saved to reinvest in crucial community services.\u201dThe Inflation Reduction Act allows tax-exempt and governmental entities to receive elective payments for 12 clean energy tax credits, including the major Investment and Production Tax (45 and 48) credits, as well as tax credits for electric vehicles and charging stations. Businesses can also choose elective pay for three of those credits: the credits for Advanced Manufacturing (45X), Carbon Oxide Sequestration (45Q), and Clean Hydrogen (45V).\u00a0The Inflation Reduction Act also allows businesses to transfer all or a portion of any of 11 clean energy credits to a third-party in exchange for tax-free immediate funds, so that businesses can take advantage of tax incentives if they do not have sufficient tax liability to fully utilize the credits themselves. Entities without sufficient tax liability were previously unable to realize the full value of credits, leaving only corporations able to take advantage of federal tax incentives. This raised costs, created challenges for financing projects, and limited the ability of communities and other organizations to realize the full economic and environmental benefits of clean energy. Final rules on transferability will be finalized in the near future.Treasury\u2019s elective pay final rules provide certainty for applicable entities to understand the law\u2019s scope and requirements for eligibility. The final rules also lay out the process and timeline to claim and receive an elective payment.Along with final rules on elective pay, Treasury today also issued a separate Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) that is intended to provide further clarity and flexibility for applicable entities that that co-own clean energy projects and would like to utilize elective pay.Under the IRA, entities treated as partnerships for federal tax purposes are not eligible for elective pay, regardless of whether one or more of its partners is an applicable entity. However, the proposed elective pay regulations clarified -- and the final regulations confirm -- that there are pathways for an applicable entity to access elective pay for credits it earns through a joint ownership arrangement including validly \u201celecting out\u201d of partnership tax treatment. Treasury and IRS agreed with commenters that existing guidance on making a valid election out of partnership tax treatment for clean energy arrangements was limited, and updates were needed for these arrangements to be more effective.The section 761(a) NPRM issued today provides a broader and more accessible pathway for applicable entities that co-own renewable energy projects to elect out of partnership tax status and therefore access elective pay. To qualify under these proposed rules, co-ownership arrangements must be organized exclusively to produce electricity from their applicable credit property, have one or more applicable entity co-owners that will claim elective pay, and meet certain other requirements.Specifically, these proposed regulations would:Permit renewable energy investments to be made through a noncorporate entity, rather than requiring direct co-ownership of the property or facility by the applicable entity;Modify certain joint marketing restrictions to provide that multi-year power purchase agreements would not violate the requirements to elect out of partnership tax treatment.Treasury and IRS welcome written comments submitted through regulations.gov. The comment period is open until May 10, 2024.To facilitate eligible entities receiving a direct payment, transferring a clean energy credit, or claiming a CHIPS credit, the IRS built IRS Energy Credits Online (ECO) for recipients to complete the pre-file registration process and receive a registration number. The registration number must be included on the eligible entity\u2019s annual return when making an elective payment election or transfer election for a clean energy credit. The registration process helps prevent improper payments to fraudulent actors and provides the IRS with basic information to ensure that any entity that qualifies for these credit monetization mechanisms can readily access these benefits upon filing a return and making an elective payment election.###",

        "text": "Nebraska and Maine split their electoral vote. Is it a better system than winner-take-all?\nThe split system might be motivating Maine\u2019s Republican voters, too.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m a Republican in the Second Congressional District, maybe I\u2019m not super motivated to go out and vote for president,\u201d Brewer said. \u201cBut since it\u2019s a split vote arrangement, then my vote can still matter.\u201d\n\n\n\nSplit vs. winner-take-all\n\nSome argue the split system has created more representative elections in Nebraska and Maine.\n\nYet Barry Burden, who heads up the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said that might not prove true if the system were expanded to other states.\n\n\u201cSplitting votes has its upsides in Nebraska and Maine,\u201d Burden said. \u201cBut if it were done nationwide, I would not say it\u2019s fairer and it might even have some more perverse consequences than the current system.\u201d\n\nBurden suspects a national split-vote system would intensify gerrymandering. He also points out that a candidate could still win congressional districts while losing the popular vote. Like in 2012, when Mitt Romney actually beat Obama in a majority of districts.\n\n\u201cIf that race had been based on congressional districts in all the states, Obama would have lost, even though he won the popular vote and the electoral college vote,\u201d Burden said. \u201cSo districts can create some weird distortions.\u201d\n\nJonathan Rodden, a political science professor at Stanford University, said it would also turn battleground states into battleground cities, likely contributing to partisanship and further dividing urban and rural residents.\n\n\u201cWe think it's bad to have an election that's only determined by Michigan and Pennsylvania \u2013 we would then have an election that was determined by, like, a couple of carefully selected districts within those states,\u201d Rodden said.\n\n\n\n\u2018Sour grapes\u2019\n\nBills have been introduced in Wisconsin, Michigan and New Hampshire to go to a split electoral system, but they\u2019ve stalled in legislatures.\n\n\u201cThose bills are often coming from people in the losing party who are unhappy that the state has given all of its electoral votes to the winner, even if it\u2019s a narrow margin,\u201d Burden said. \u201cSo it might be a little bit of sour grapes.\u201d\n\nEven when a state has the system, it\u2019s not clear it\u2019s here to stay. In Nebraska, Republican lawmakers in the officially nonpartisan legislature have tried over and over to get rid of the split vote and return to a winner-take-all approach.\n\nIn 2016, the state legislature was on a final reading of a bill that would restore a winner-take-all system \u2013 a typically perfunctory step on the way to law \u2013 when then-state Sen. Ernie Chambers filibustered the bill. The bill ultimately fell short on votes and Nebraska kept the split approach.\n\nTo Nebraska Secretary of State Bob Evnen, splitting the vote incentivizes gerrymandering and undermines the statewide vote in Nebraska. He points out that Trump beat Biden by more than 182,000 votes in Nebraska\u2019s popular election but still lost an electoral vote.\n\n\u201cYou have this situation where someone who won in a landslide in the state didn\u2019t get all the electoral votes,\u201d Evnen said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily reflective of the interests of the entire state.\u201d\n\nWhile others debate changes to the electoral college and ponder if the model in Maine and Nebraska provides a good option, Evnen has no doubt.\n\n\u201cOne thing's for sure: the way we're doing it now would not be a good policy for the country to adopt,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we're just hampering ourselves by doing it differently than 48 other states.\u201d\n\nAt the moment, though, any efforts to change the state\u2019s electoral system have been stuck in a legislative committee since March 2023.\n\nNebraska\u2019s split vote will likely be in play for the 2024 presidential election \u2014 a possibility Precious McKesson is excited for.\n\n\u201cYou know, we've only used it twice,\u201d the executive director of the Nebraska Democratic Party said. \u201cOur goal is to use it that third time.\u201d\n\nThis story was produced in partnership with Harvest Public Media, a collaboration of public media newsrooms in the Midwest.

        "text": "With one candidate left, Alaska Democrats\u2019 plan is to set presidential preference by voice vote \u2022 Alaska Beacon\nWith President Joe Biden the only candidate left seeking the Democratic nomination in Alaska, the state party plan is to hold a voice vote in caucuses to decide on the party nomination rather than have party members cast electronic ballots in a primary. Party leadership said it would confirm the plan with the national party.\n\nMinnesota Rep. Dean Phillips, Biden\u2019s last remaining rival for the nomination, suspended his campaign on Wednesday after receiving low vote counts in every primary held so far, including his home state.\n\nUnder a revised plan submitted to the National Democratic Party in late February, party members will begin the process of selecting delegates on April 13. If there were multiple active candidates who qualified for the ballot, then party members would vote by electronic ballots in a party-run primary.\n\nBut in the case of only one active candidate, the party plan is to have party members in each Alaska House district hold a voice vote on April 13 in caucuses.\n\nParty Executive Director Lindsay Kavanaugh said that most districts have the capacity for people to call into a party meeting to vote remotely.\n\n\u201cAll Alaska Democrats are invited to participate,\u201d Kavanaugh said of the vote.\n\nWhile the proportion of the delegates who each candidate would receive will be determined on April 13, the actual delegates will be picked at a state party convention on May 18 in Juneau, according to party rules.\n\nThose delegates will attend the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August.\n\nWhile Democrats in some states have been voting for the option of having delegates who are not committed to voting for Biden, the party in Alaska does not have an option to vote \u201cuncommitted\u201d under party rules.\n\nPhillips would have needed 15% of the vote to receive any Alaska delegates under party rules. In the 18 nominating contests held so far, he only cleared that bar in New Hampshire, the only state where Biden\u2019s name did not appear on the ballot.\n\nSome national news sites incorrectly list April 6 as the date of the Alaska party primary. That date was listed in an older version of the state party delegate selection plan. The April 13 date was picked by the party and included in the current plan.",

        "text": "Millions of Americans overseas can vote \u2014 but few do. Here's how to vote as an American living abroad.\nMillions of Americans headed to the polls on Super Tuesday 2024, but there were around 2.8 million Americans living overseas who were also eligible to vote in U.S. elections, according to government data. Historically, only a tiny percentage of these eligible expatriates actually cast ballots.\n\nAccording to the Federal Voting Assistance Program, which helps U.S. expats vote, only 3.4% of eligible Americans overseas voted in the 2022 midterm elections. Americans living in the U.S. were over 18 times more likely to vote than those living abroad.\n\nWho are U.S. overseas voters?\n\nThe FVAP says Americans living abroad are difficult to study, but foreign and domestic data can be compiled to make some estimates about who they are.\n\nThe population of overseas U.S. nationals has increased 42% since 2010, and now totals around 5.7 million.\n\nFor the 2.8 million who are eligible voters, the right to vote is protected by the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act of 1986, which requires that states allow military service members, their eligible family, and other overseas Americans to vote absentee in federal elections.\n\nThe majority of Americans abroad are in Canada and the United Kingdom. Most have moved for spouses, jobs, or extended family.\n\nMany Americans overseas are in the military or are members of a military family. There are about 1.4 million active duty U.S. service members stationed overseas, and about three-quarters of them are eligible to vote.\n\nFor overseas eligible voters who did not cast ballots in 2022, the vast majority said it was because they could not complete the voting process, not because they weren't interested in voting.\n\nHow to vote as an American overseas\n\nFirst, a prospective overseas voter needs to establish their voting residence. This is necessary for the voting office to determine which elections a person is eligible for and to send an appropriate ballot. A person's voting residence will be the last address at which they lived in the U.S. before they moved abroad.\n\nThere are different ways to vote from abroad offered by each state, but the FVAP says one way that is standard across the entire U.S. is to submit the Federal Post Card Application.\n\nAccording to the program, for the presidential election in November, it's best to send in the FCPA by August 1. If you use the FCPA, you are guaranteed to be sent your ballot at least 45 days before an election.\n\nIt is a good idea for Americans abroad to send in a new FCPA every January or if they have a change of address.\n\nHow do the main political parties reach overseas voters?\n\nOn Super Tuesday, the U.K. chapter of Democrats Abroad ran several get-out-the-vote events across the country as part of their official primary process for the presidential nomination. The organization is treated by the Democratic National Committee as an official wing of the party, with its own delegate selection and primary process for presidential elections.\n\nWhile the primary process should prove a formality for the group's nomination of President Biden this year, the chair of the Democrats Abroad U.K., Kristin Wolfe, says there is a larger prize at stake in registering Americans abroad to vote.\n\n\"We know that in 2020, the overseas votes delivered the election win for President Biden in Georgia and in Arizona, and without that, the election would not have potentially gone the way it did. So we were the margin of victory,\" Wolfe told CBS News at the group's voting center in London on Super Tuesday.\n\nAbby Taubin of \"Vote From Abroad,\" wearing a U.S. flag face mask, campaigning to sign up U.S. citizens to vote in the upcoming American presidential election, on Sept. 23, 2020 in London, England. LEON NEAL / Getty Images\n\nWolfe said that part of the messaging strategy of the Democrats Abroad is to educate voters outside the U.S. on how to cast their ballots in the hope that those votes are counted when it matters in November.\n\n\"We're interested in it because every vote matters. And particularly in this election, democracy is on the line,\" Wolfe said.\n\nWhile the Democratic National Committee has implemented a coordinated effort to register voters abroad, the Republican National Committee has no such organized group in place.\n\n\"It's on our list of things to do and we've talked about it with the [Republican] leadership,\" Greg Swenson, chair of the U.K. chapter of Republicans Overseas, told CBS News on Super Tuesday.\n\nRepublicans Overseas is a political action committee that describes itself as a grassroots-led organization seeking \"to direct the policy concerns of overseas Americans back to political leaders and Presidential candidates.\"\n\nThe organization has conducted volunteer-led efforts to get out the vote and has worked with the U.S. Embassy in London to assist voters in the U.K., but Swenson says it lacks the financial support for a more disciplined recruitment drive.\n\nWhile he's lobbied the RNC to do more to raise voter participation among Americans abroad, Swenson told CBS News that one stumbling block to his efforts is that the national Republican Party may see devoting resources to the cause as more trouble than it's worth.\n\n\"The overseas voters typically vote at, like, single digits in terms of participation,\" he said, adding that it would be a significant hurdle for the GOP to get the types of numbers from voters abroad needed to swing a crucial swing state in November.\n\n\"There might not be the critical mass to move an election, even if you take a super close state like Wisconsin,\" he said. \"The chances of having 40,000 [expat] voters from one state in a particular country \u2026 it's a real stretch.\"\n\nStill, Swenson thinks the GOP is missing an opportunity with one crucial constituency: military families abroad.\n\n\"It's the first thing I talk about when I talk to the RNC,\" he told CBS News. \"The military bases are heavily biased towards Republicans, and that's a great source.\"",

Vermont voters chose electors to represent them in the Electoral College via a popular vote. The state of Vermont has 3 electoral votes in the Electoral College, following reapportionment due to the 2020 United States census in which the state neither gained nor lost a seat.[1]\n\nVermont was won by the Democratic candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris, by a landslide margin of 31.21%. As a sparsely populated rural state in northern New England, Vermont was historically a moderate/liberal \"Yankee Republican\" stronghold, having backed the GOP in all but one presidential election between the party's formation and George H.W. Bush's narrow victory in 1988, excluding Lyndon B. Johnson's 1964 landslide. However, an influx of more liberal voters has turned Vermont into a Democratic stronghold at the presidential level since the early 1990s, as the state has been won by the Democratic candidate in every presidential race starting in 1992, all of these victories being by double digits apart from Al Gore's 9.93% win in 2000.\n\nIn 2020, Vermont was Joe Biden's strongest state in the nation, with a margin of 35.4%.[2] While Harris's 31.21% margin slightly decreased from Biden's, and Trump managed to narrowly flip Orleans County, Vermont was once again the most Democratic state, only the second occasion in the state's history it was the strongest for the Democrats, and the first time since 1956 in which it was the strongest state for either party in back to back elections.[3]\n\nPrimary elections [ edit ]\n\nRepublican primary [ edit ]\n\nThe Vermont Republican primary was held on Super Tuesday, March 5, 2024.

Through the development and delivery of a campaign to improve community cohesion in their local area, students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds will be in with a chance to win an all-expenses paid trip the USA.\n\nOver the course of three months, student teams will be supported by industry experts to develop their teamwork, influencing and communication skills to produce a grassroots campaign that improves awareness and understanding of different cultures or tackles a social justice issue important and local to them.\n\nShortlisted teams will be invited to submit and present their campaign results to a professional panel at a Finalists Forum day in London in June. The panel will judge the campaigns based on creativity, their communications approach, reach and impact.\n\nFour winning teams (20 students) will be offered an 8-day, all-expenses paid trip to Washington DC to take part in a Campaign College alongside the final days of the US Presidential Election. Students will stay on university campuses, visit the capital environs, network with a range of experts and prominent speakers in US politics, hit the campaign trail in election hotspots around Virginia and Pennsylvania, and learn new skills to use in campaigning and their future careers back home.\n\nJenni Anderson, Chief Executive at The Talent Foundry said:\n\n\u201c2024 is democracy\u2019s biggest year, with more than 80 countries holding national elections. For students considering a career in politics, law or public service, this programme is a chance to test their campaigning skills and get feedback and advice from those who live and breathe the most famous campaign trail in the world.\n\n\u201cThis is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to experience the final days of an election where the world is watching. The skills, networks and connections the students will make while campaigning locally will be put into practice on a global stage. We wish them the best of luck in delivering their social justice projects to make a difference in their local communities.\u201d\n\nInspire US alumni said:\n\n\u201cInspire US has a place for everyone. It\u2019s a safe place to find yourself and your values. It makes you challenge your thoughts and ideas through healthy debate. I feel confident about approaching challenges with an open mind and enthusiasm.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis trip has honestly transformed me as a person. Instead of saying no to new things I\u2019ve learnt to say yes and to be more confident in my skills and abilities. This trip has taught me a lot more about politics, campaigning and life skills - how to cook, network, live with new people and to be independent.\u201d\n\nTeachers wishing to register students to participate in the programme should visit The Talent Foundry website.\n\nThe Talent Foundry Campaign College will take place in Washington DC from 30 October - 6 November 2024.\n\nThis programme will be the fourth overseas Inspire US programme offered by The Talent Foundry to schools in underserved communities. Students travelled to the USA for the 2012 and 2016 elections and 2018 midterm elections. This programme is being funded by Denford Associates and The Talent Foundry donors and supporters.\n\nThis programme is available to students in Year 12 going into Year 13 in September 2024, or S5 - S6 in Scotland. One member of teaching or support staff from each winning team or school will accompany their students to the Finalist Forum in London and to the USA.\n\nAbout The Talent Foundry\n\nFounded in 2009, The Talent Foundry is an education charity with a social mobility mission. Your background, your hometown, your skills, and your network all factor in your chances of a successful future.

        "text": "Millions of Americans overseas can vote \u2014 but few do. Here's how to vote as an American living abroad.\nMillions of Americans headed to the polls on Super Tuesday 2024, but there were around 2.8 million Americans living overseas who were also eligible to vote in U.S. elections, according to government data. Historically, only a tiny percentage of these eligible expatriates actually cast ballots.\n\nAccording to the Federal Voting Assistance Program, which helps U.S. expats vote, only 3.4% of eligible Americans overseas voted in the 2022 midterm elections. Americans living in the U.S. were over 18 times more likely to vote than those living abroad.\n\nWho are U.S. overseas voters?\n\nThe FVAP says Americans living abroad are difficult to study, but foreign and domestic data can be compiled to make some estimates about who they are.\n\nThe population of overseas U.S. nationals has increased 42% since 2010, and now totals around 5.7 million.\n\nFor the 2.8 million who are eligible voters, the right to vote is protected by the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act of 1986, which requires that states allow military service members, their eligible family, and other overseas Americans to vote absentee in federal elections.\n\nThe majority of Americans abroad are in Canada and the United Kingdom. Most have moved for spouses, jobs, or extended family.\n\nMany Americans overseas are in the military or are members of a military family. There are about 1.4 million active duty U.S. service members stationed overseas, and about three-quarters of them are eligible to vote.\n\nFor overseas eligible voters who did not cast ballots in 2022, the vast majority said it was because they could not complete the voting process, not because they weren't interested in voting.\n\nHow to vote as an American overseas\n\nFirst, a prospective overseas voter needs to establish their voting residence. This is necessary for the voting office to determine which elections a person is eligible for and to send an appropriate ballot. A person's voting residence will be the last address at which they lived in the U.S. before they moved abroad.\n\nThere are different ways to vote from abroad offered by each state, but the FVAP says one way that is standard across the entire U.S. is to submit the Federal Post Card Application.\n\nAccording to the program, for the presidential election in November, it's best to send in the FCPA by August 1. If you use the FCPA, you are guaranteed to be sent your ballot at least 45 days before an election.\n\nIt is a good idea for Americans abroad to send in a new FCPA every January or if they have a change of address.\n\nHow do the main political parties reach overseas voters?\n\nOn Super Tuesday, the U.K. chapter of Democrats Abroad ran several get-out-the-vote events across the country as part of their official primary process for the presidential nomination. The organization is treated by the Democratic National Committee as an official wing of the party, with its own delegate selection and primary process for presidential elections.\n\nWhile the primary process should prove a formality for the group's nomination of President Biden this year, the chair of the Democrats Abroad U.K., Kristin Wolfe, says there is a larger prize at stake in registering Americans abroad to vote.\n\n\"We know that in 2020, the overseas votes delivered the election win for President Biden in Georgia and in Arizona, and without that, the election would not have potentially gone the way it did. So we were the margin of victory,\" Wolfe told CBS News at the group's voting center in London on Super Tuesday.\n\nAbby Taubin of \"Vote From Abroad,\" wearing a U.S. flag face mask, campaigning to sign up U.S. citizens to vote in the upcoming American presidential election, on Sept. 23, 2020 in London, England. LEON NEAL / Getty Images\n\nWolfe said that part of the messaging strategy of the Democrats Abroad is to educate voters outside the U.S. on how to cast their ballots in the hope that those votes are counted when it matters in November.\n\n\"We're interested in it because every vote matters. And particularly in this election, democracy is on the line,\" Wolfe said.\n\nWhile the Democratic National Committee has implemented a coordinated effort to register voters abroad, the Republican National Committee has no such organized group in place.\n\n\"It's on our list of things to do and we've talked about it with the [Republican] leadership,\" Greg Swenson, chair of the U.K. chapter of Republicans Overseas, told CBS News on Super Tuesday.\n\nRepublicans Overseas is a political action committee that describes itself as a grassroots-led organization seeking \"to direct the policy concerns of overseas Americans back to political leaders and Presidential candidates.\"\n\nThe organization has conducted volunteer-led efforts to get out the vote and has worked with the U.S. Embassy in London to assist voters in the U.K., but Swenson says it lacks the financial support for a more disciplined recruitment drive.\n\nWhile he's lobbied the RNC to do more to raise voter participation among Americans abroad, Swenson told CBS News that one stumbling block to his efforts is that the national Republican Party may see devoting resources to the cause as more trouble than it's worth.\n\n\"The overseas voters typically vote at, like, single digits in terms of participation,\" he said, adding that it would be a significant hurdle for the GOP to get the types of numbers from voters abroad needed to swing a crucial swing state in November.\n\n\"There might not be the critical mass to move an election, even if you take a super close state like Wisconsin,\" he said. \"The chances of having 40,000 [expat] voters from one state in a particular country \u2026 it's a real stretch.\"\n\nStill, Swenson thinks the GOP is missing an opportunity with one crucial constituency: military families abroad.\n\n\"It's the first thing I talk about when I talk to the RNC,\" he told CBS News. \"The military bases are heavily biased towards Republicans, and that's a great source.\"",

        "text": "Did State of the Union change how voters see Biden?\nDid State of the Union change how voters see Biden?\n\nBBC\n\nPresident Joe Biden gave a vigorous State of the Union address on Thursday, working to counter a narrative haunting his re-election bid - that he's too old for the job.\n\nUS political pundits and analysts called his roughly 60-minute speech \"fiery\" and \"forceful\".\n\nMr Biden, 81, is the oldest president to hold office, and opinion polls often show his age is on the minds of American voters.\n\nWe asked members of our US voter panel, many of who had supported Biden but expressed concerns about his age, if his speech had affected how they see him.\n\nAylon Gipson\n\nAylon Gipson, Alabama, Democrat\n\nA 21-year-old economics student at Morehouse College, an historically black university, Aylon voted for the first time in the last election.\n\nI have concerns about his age. He's about the age of my grandmother, and I know how my grandmother is.\n\nBut I think we saw a fiery speech from him yesterday, and it made me more confident. He showed us that he can still be quick on his feet. He delivered some blows back to Republican hecklers that were excellent.\n\nI'll definitely be voting for Joe Biden, even though he has issues and problems with age.\n\nBiden followed through on delivering a black woman to the Supreme Court. He has fought against losing protections with the overturning of Roe v Wade. He's done his best to cancel student loan debt.\n\nDarlene Buhler\n\nDarlene Buhler, South Dakota, Republican\n\nDarlene, 65, voted for Donald Trump in 2020 and hasn't been persuaded to vote differently this time around.\n\n\"Fiery\" is a polite word to say that he was rambling. He just seemed to be mad, and he came off as a grumpy old man.\n\nTo me, the expectations and the bar were set too low. It was like, \"let's just hope he gets through this and not stumble off the stage\". He was more coherent than I've heard him in the past.\n\nAnd so the question is, do I think he can handle four more years? I don't think so. It's a shame that we don't have an age limit.\n\nIf I have to choose between him and Donald Trump, I'll choose Trump, the lesser of two evils. I don't feel like President Biden or the Democratic party have done enough for black people. They expect to automatically receive our vote. They have to earn it.\n\nAmy Kalokerinos\n\nAmy Kalokerinos, New York, Independent\n\nAmy, 42, has voted both Democrat and Republican in her lifetime.\n\nI think it's the best speech President Biden has ever given in his entire career. Before yesterday, I did have doubts. But I do not question his aptitude after last night's speech.\n\nHim pounding on the podium, him speaking more sternly and yelling - that's all the stuff that Trump does that the American population responds to. He's presenting differently, and I think it's resonating.\n\nI am an ageist, right or wrong. And I do think both candidates are too old.\n\nI voted for Biden in 2020 and will vote for anyone but Trump in November. Overturning Roe v Wade was it for me.\n\nMichelle Dunkley\n\nMichelle Dunkley, New Jersey, Democrat\n\nThe State of the Union address felt like more of a campaign speech, designed to promote his mental acuity.\n\nHe diplomatically chided his predecessor for his language and actions that have deepened the political divisions in this country.\n\nAs much as I like Biden, I believe he is too old to continue to lead the country. But if Trump wins he will be as old during his term.\n\nThis country needs younger people to lead.\n\nKaren Kemp\n\nKaren Kemp, Connecticut, Democrat\n\nKaren, 48, voted for Joe Biden in 2020. She was worried about how he would perform at the podium.\n\nI had concerns that Joe Biden would not be able to combat the pervasive perceptions that too often follow the elderly, things like they serve no use to society.\n\nI thought he might stutter and lose his train of thought. But he showed energy and experience.\n\nHis State of the Union speech boiled down the choice Americans will face in November and drew clear distinctions between a party and man who wants good things for this country and a former president who holds a starkly different, largely unfavourable view.",

        "text": "State of the Union: What the world made of Biden's big speech\nState of the Union: What the world made of Biden's big speech\n\nWatch: Jokes and jabs at his rival - how Biden went on the attack\n\nForeign policy figured highly in Joe Biden's annual address to Congress, which highlighted US involvement in conflicts around the world. So how was his speech received in those places?\n\nIt was notable that the president chose to begin his State of the Union by discussing Ukraine. He later went on to spend a few minutes on the Israel-Hamas war and finished by talking about \"standing up\" to China.\n\nWe asked three BBC correspondents to analyse his comments in each area.\n\nNazi comparison will annoy Putin\n\nBy Sarah Rainsford, Eastern Europe correspondent\n\nA year before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, President Biden agreed with an interviewer that Vladimir Putin was a \"killer\", enraging the Kremlin. Three years later, Mr Biden has now compared him to Adolf Hitler.\n\nIn his State of the Union address, he referred to Hitler being \"on the march\" in 1941 in Europe and then said that the Russian leader was \"on the march\" himself, warning that Russian aggression would not stop at Ukraine.\n\nHis message to President Putin, he said in his speech, was simple. \"We will not bow down.\"\n\nThe Russian leader has claimed, falsely, that his invasion of Ukraine is aimed at \"de-Nazifying\" Russia's neighbour and he has elevated the Soviet Union's defeat of Hitler in World War II to near-cult status. So Moscow won't like this comparison at all.\n\nGetty Images\n\nBut Mr Biden wasn't addressing Russia alone. He stressed the urgent need for the US to continue supporting Ukraine as it battles to defend itself and he called on Congress to unblock the bill that would release the funding Kyiv needs.\n\nI've heard politicians and analysts in Ukraine describe losing US financial backing as \"catastrophic\". The delay is already damaging, forcing soldiers to ration ammunition on the frontlines.\n\nAs Moscow smarts at the comparison with Nazi Germany, Ukraine will welcome a State of the Union speech that opened with a rallying cry for democracy and support for Kyiv. President Biden said the US wouldn't \"walk away\".\n\nSuch words are important and appreciated. But similar calls have been uttered before and all the time Ukraine is losing more territory and more soldiers.\n\nUnease in China as Biden talks tough\n\nBy Laura Bicker, China correspondent\n\nIt's hard to know which candidate China would prefer as it watches the discord on display in Washington during the State of the Union.\n\nThe contrast with its own rubber-stamp parliament, the National People's Congress, is stark. Nearly 3,000 delegates are meeting in Beijing this week in the Great Hall of the People where speeches are watched with quiet nods, a reverent hush and unwavering approval from the Communist Party elite.\n\nThere will be a level of unease from China's business sector that President Biden sees the need to show how tough he will be on Beijing. He said he wanted \"competition - not conflict\" with China, but business leaders may ask what form that competition will take.\n\nWatch: Who does China\u2019s Communist Party want - Trump or Biden?\n\nHe has already expanded sanctions against China on a range of issues, from human rights abuses to its relations with Russia. Relations are also strained over China's behaviour in disputed areas of the South China Sea, its military intimidation of Taiwan and growing technological competition.\n\nBeijing will not see Mr Biden's competitor as a more promising prospect. While president, Donald Trump started a trade war with China and recently threatened to impose a 60% tariff on Chinese goods if he wins in November.\n\nBut Beijing might like the idea of another Trump presidency. The Biden administration has built an alliance to counter the might of China and he has been clear that the US would defend Taiwan if China tried to take the self-governing island by force.\n\nIn contrast, Mr Trump has refused to say he would help Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its own territory.\n\nChina can exploit these differences in Washington and use them to appear as a safer, long-term diplomatic bet for countries around the world as the two compete for global influence.\n\nBiden's rebuke picked up in Israeli media\n\nBy Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent\n\nPresident Biden called events of the past five months \"gut-wrenching\" in his address.\n\nWhile he blamed Hamas for starting the Gaza war, he stressed the high civilian death toll among Palestinians and had a sharp message for Israel about the need to allow basic supplies to reach the besieged territory, amid UN warnings of mass starvation.\n\nAid, he said, \"cannot be a secondary consideration or a bargaining chip. Protecting and saving innocent lives has to be a priority.\" This rebuke featured prominently in the Israeli media on Friday morning.\n\nDriven by domestic politics in an election year - the need to show stronger American action - as well as deep humanitarian need, Mr Biden announced a plan for a new floating pier off Gaza to bring in food and basic supplies on ships via Cyprus.\n\nIn many ways, this ambitious idea - which the president was careful to say would not involve US military boots on the ground - is a measure of frustration with a key ally.",

Through the development and delivery of a campaign to improve community cohesion in their local area, students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds will be in with a chance to win an all-expenses paid trip the USA.\n\nOver the course of three months, student teams will be supported by industry experts to develop their teamwork, influencing and communication skills to produce a grassroots campaign that improves awareness and understanding of different cultures or tackles a social justice issue important and local to them.\n\nShortlisted teams will be invited to submit and present their campaign results to a professional panel at a Finalists Forum day in London in June. The panel will judge the campaigns based on creativity, their communications approach, reach and impact.\n\nFour winning teams (20 students) will be offered an 8-day, all-expenses paid trip to Washington DC to take part in a Campaign College alongside the final days of the US Presidential Election. Students will stay on university campuses, visit the capital environs, network with a range of experts and prominent speakers in US politics, hit the campaign trail in election hotspots around Virginia and Pennsylvania, and learn new skills to use in campaigning and their future careers back home.\n\nJenni Anderson, Chief Executive at The Talent Foundry said:\n\n\u201c2024 is democracy\u2019s biggest year, with more than 80 countries holding national elections. For students considering a career in politics, law or public service, this programme is a chance to test their campaigning skills and get feedback and advice from those who live and breathe the most famous campaign trail in the world.\n\n\u201cThis is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to experience the final days of an election where the world is watching. The skills, networks and connections the students will make while campaigning locally will be put into practice on a global stage.

It\u2019s a safe place to find yourself and your values. It makes you challenge your thoughts and ideas through healthy debate. I feel confident about approaching challenges with an open mind and enthusiasm.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis trip has honestly transformed me as a person. Instead of saying no to new things I\u2019ve learnt to say yes and to be more confident in my skills and abilities. This trip has taught me a lot more about politics, campaigning and life skills - how to cook, network, live with new people and to be independent.\u201d\n\nTeachers wishing to register students to participate in the programme should visit The Talent Foundry website.\n\nThe Talent Foundry Campaign College will take place in Washington DC from 30 October - 6 November 2024.\n\nThis programme will be the fourth overseas Inspire US programme offered by The Talent Foundry to schools in underserved communities.

        "text": "Rising Populism & Geopolitical Instability in 2024\nWith national elections lined up in over 70 countries this year, half the world's population will be going to the polls. 2024 will be a pivotal year for global trade and (geo)political stability, with Coface's social and political risk index warning of a high-risk, shaky environment worldwide. Below we analyse the risks we\u2019ll be tracking most closely this year. Find out more about the 3 risks to watch out for this year.\n\n2024: election fever, rising populism and geopolitical instability\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that 2024 is going to be a tumultuous year for elections, with the first voters gone to the polls in Taiwan in January, and the last in the US in November. This historic wave will involver more than 70 countries (including seven of the world\u2019s most populous), half of the global population and some 55% of global GDP!\n\nFrom India to Mexico, via Austria, Tunisia, Indonesia and El Salvador, the elections will provide an opportunity for populist winds to sweep across all five continents. This will give extra momentum to a trend that has taken root over the last ten years and more: the rise of social unrest and (geo)political instability.\n\nIn a world that is reshaping the global geopolitical order -inherited from the end of the Second World War!- some of the elections will prove to be decisive. The US elections will be a pivotal moment for the world landscape, and will certainly be the target of attempts to destabilise it.\n\nThe same applies to Taiwan, where the victory of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) means that the tensions with China will continue to focus on the status of the island. Likewise, the result of the vote in the US will be critical for future relations between the West and mainland China. The elections will be especially important since they will take place in a stormy international climate characterised by fierce Sino-American competition, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the war between Israel and Hamas.\n\n\" With this super-charged electoral calendar on the horizon, our latest social and political risk index highlights that social and political vulnerability is accelerating around the world, creating uncertainty and instability for our environment in equal measure. The global average score has risen to 38.6%, not far from the 2021 peak (39.4%) following the Covid-19 crisis, and up on pre-Covid levels (2016-2020 average: 36.9%). Our indicators have been announcing that we\u2019re entering a new phase for these risks since the start of the decade.\"\n\nexplains Ruben NIZARD, Economist North America and Head of Political Risk at Coface.\n\nThe 3 risks to watch out for in 2024\n\nThe risks associated with these elections vary in their nature and degree. In some of the countries, even though elections will actually take place, voters will be given only a limited choice. At the same time, the build-up of elections gives us the opportunity to monitor three risk trends.\n\n1. Political shifts and uncertainty\n\nThe current socio-economic environment should contribute to a feeling of hostility towards the government in place, bringing uncertainties and volatility for businesses during the election periods. This political uncertainty will be all the more acute in that the rise in populism is sounding a powerful warning. This trend, which has been constant since at least as far back as 2010, was highlighted once more by the electoral success of Geert Wilders and Javier Milei in the Netherlands and Argentina towards the end of last year. As a result, it is even harder to predict what direction government policy will take.\n\nSocial and political vulnerability in Europe is growing fast, and the upcoming elections \u2013 especially for the European Parliament \u2013 will serve as fertile ground for anti-European extremist movements. In addition, some members of the EU will hold national elections: Austria, Croatia, Finland, Lithuania, Portugal, Romania, Belgium and Slovakia.\n\n2. Social unrest\n\nA second risk is the potential escalation in social unrest fuelled by rising prices, the erosion of trust in politicians and the widespread dissatisfaction of voters. Rising inflation and the slowdown in economic growth have intensified grievances \u2013 especially distrust of institutions \u2013 that had been bubbling under the surface since well before the Covid health crisis. It is highly possible that the upcoming elections will create an environment for mass demonstrations in several parts of the world.\n\nSeventeen countries in Africa, for example, might organise elections in 2024, on a continent with the highest average social and political vulnerability score and the biggest increase in one year. This dynamic is in keeping with the political instability experienced by numerous African countries over recent years, which has included coups and long-drawn-out conflicts. The recent postponement of the presidential elections in Senegal is a perfect illustration of this. It will also be important to keep a close eye on the electoral process in certain Asian countries, including Sri Lanka, as with recent events in Pakistan.\n\n3. Geopolitical risks\n\nWith the stalemate in the war between Russia and Ukraine, heightened tensions in the Middle East, and the expansion of BRICS* to include five new members**, it is clear that the sea change is gaining pace, driven on by deep-seated challenges to Western models and the world order. Against this turbulent geopolitical backdrop, the final round of some of these elections will take on particular importance.\n\nThe DPP's recent triumph in Taiwan doesn\u2019t just have an impact on the 24 million people living on the island and relations between the two sides of the Formosa Strait: it also impacts the global geopolitical dynamic in its entirety. Elsewhere, one of the key issues in the elections in Mexico and India \u2013 two of the planet\u2019s most populous countries \u2013 will be what position they take up on the world stage.\n\nIn addition, as the fighting continues in Europe, Ukraine and Russia are scheduled to go to the polls, although the elections in the former appear to be in jeopardy. While there is no question that Putin will be re-elected in Russia, voter turnout could give us an indication of popular support for the war. In a nutshell, the packed 2024 election timetable will undoubtedly shape the world order for the years ahead.\n\nKey points for 2024\n\nThe combination of all these factors will help trigger an increase in Coface\u2019s social and political risk indicator. We really do need to take these warning signs seriously: the elections in 2024 will be held in a context of heightened geopolitical tension between the different blocs, with the non-aligned countries taking up position on a case-by-case basis. These complex dynamics won\u2019t just fuel populist tendencies and geopolitical instability; they\u2019ll also contribute to a global climate of uncertainty or widespread anxiety and dissatisfaction. This decade, it seems, is ushering in a new phase of social and political risk, and it\u2019s already looking worrying for the future, warns Ruben NIZARD.\n\n*BRICS: Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.\n\n**Saudi Arabia, Egypt, United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia and Iran.",

        "text": "Did State of the Union change how voters see Biden?\nDid State of the Union change how voters see Biden?\n\nBBC\n\nPresident Joe Biden gave a vigorous State of the Union address on Thursday, working to counter a narrative haunting his re-election bid - that he's too old for the job.\n\nUS political pundits and analysts called his roughly 60-minute speech \"fiery\" and \"forceful\".\n\nMr Biden, 81, is the oldest president to hold office, and opinion polls often show his age is on the minds of American voters.\n\nWe asked members of our US voter panel, many of who had supported Biden but expressed concerns about his age, if his speech had affected how they see him.\n\nAylon Gipson\n\nAylon Gipson, Alabama, Democrat\n\nA 21-year-old economics student at Morehouse College, an historically black university, Aylon voted for the first time in the last election.\n\nI have concerns about his age. He's about the age of my grandmother, and I know how my grandmother is.\n\nBut I think we saw a fiery speech from him yesterday, and it made me more confident. He showed us that he can still be quick on his feet. He delivered some blows back to Republican hecklers that were excellent.\n\nI'll definitely be voting for Joe Biden, even though he has issues and problems with age.\n\nBiden followed through on delivering a black woman to the Supreme Court. He has fought against losing protections with the overturning of Roe v Wade. He's done his best to cancel student loan debt.\n\nDarlene Buhler\n\nDarlene Buhler, South Dakota, Republican\n\nDarlene, 65, voted for Donald Trump in 2020 and hasn't been persuaded to vote differently this time around.\n\n\"Fiery\" is a polite word to say that he was rambling. He just seemed to be mad, and he came off as a grumpy old man.\n\nTo me, the expectations and the bar were set too low. It was like, \"let's just hope he gets through this and not stumble off the stage\". He was more coherent than I've heard him in the past.\n\nAnd so the question is, do I think he can handle four more years? I don't think so. It's a shame that we don't have an age limit.\n\nIf I have to choose between him and Donald Trump, I'll choose Trump, the lesser of two evils. I don't feel like President Biden or the Democratic party have done enough for black people. They expect to automatically receive our vote. They have to earn it.\n\nAmy Kalokerinos\n\nAmy Kalokerinos, New York, Independent\n\nAmy, 42, has voted both Democrat and Republican in her lifetime.\n\nI think it's the best speech President Biden has ever given in his entire career. Before yesterday, I did have doubts. But I do not question his aptitude after last night's speech.\n\nHim pounding on the podium, him speaking more sternly and yelling - that's all the stuff that Trump does that the American population responds to. He's presenting differently, and I think it's resonating.\n\nI am an ageist, right or wrong. And I do think both candidates are too old.\n\nI voted for Biden in 2020 and will vote for anyone but Trump in November. Overturning Roe v Wade was it for me.\n\nMichelle Dunkley\n\nMichelle Dunkley, New Jersey, Democrat\n\nThe State of the Union address felt like more of a campaign speech, designed to promote his mental acuity.\n\nHe diplomatically chided his predecessor for his language and actions that have deepened the political divisions in this country.\n\nAs much as I like Biden, I believe he is too old to continue to lead the country. But if Trump wins he will be as old during his term.\n\nThis country needs younger people to lead.\n\nKaren Kemp\n\nKaren Kemp, Connecticut, Democrat\n\nKaren, 48, voted for Joe Biden in 2020. She was worried about how he would perform at the podium.\n\nI had concerns that Joe Biden would not be able to combat the pervasive perceptions that too often follow the elderly, things like they serve no use to society.\n\nI thought he might stutter and lose his train of thought. But he showed energy and experience.\n\nHis State of the Union speech boiled down the choice Americans will face in November and drew clear distinctions between a party and man who wants good things for this country and a former president who holds a starkly different, largely unfavourable view.",

Three years later, Mr Biden has now compared him to Adolf Hitler.\n\nIn his State of the Union address, he referred to Hitler being \"on the march\" in 1941 in Europe and then said that the Russian leader was \"on the march\" himself, warning that Russian aggression would not stop at Ukraine.\n\nHis message to President Putin, he said in his speech, was simple. \"We will not bow down.\"\n\nThe Russian leader has claimed, falsely, that his invasion of Ukraine is aimed at \"de-Nazifying\" Russia's neighbour and he has elevated the Soviet Union's defeat of Hitler in World War II to near-cult status. So Moscow won't like this comparison at all.\n\nGetty Images\n\nBut Mr Biden wasn't addressing Russia alone. He stressed the urgent need for the US to continue supporting Ukraine as it battles to defend itself and he called on Congress to unblock the bill that would release the funding Kyiv needs.\n\nI've heard politicians and analysts in Ukraine describe losing US financial backing as \"catastrophic\". The delay is already damaging, forcing soldiers to ration ammunition on the frontlines.\n\nAs Moscow smarts at the comparison with Nazi Germany, Ukraine will welcome a State of the Union speech that opened with a rallying cry for democracy and support for Kyiv. President Biden said the US wouldn't \"walk away\".\n\nSuch words are important and appreciated. But similar calls have been uttered before and all the time Ukraine is losing more territory and more soldiers.\n\nUnease in China as Biden talks tough\n\nBy Laura Bicker, China correspondent\n\nIt's hard to know which candidate China would prefer as it watches the discord on display in Washington during the State of the Union.\n\nThe contrast with its own rubber-stamp parliament, the National People's Congress, is stark. Nearly 3,000 delegates are meeting in Beijing this week in the Great Hall of the People where speeches are watched with quiet nods, a reverent hush and unwavering approval from the Communist Party elite.\n\nThere will be a level of unease from China's business sector that President Biden sees the need to show how tough he will be on Beijing. He said he wanted \"competition - not conflict\" with China, but business leaders may ask what form that competition will take.\n\nWatch: Who does China\u2019s Communist Party want - Trump or Biden?\n\nHe has already expanded sanctions against China on a range of issues, from human rights abuses to its relations with Russia. Relations are also strained over China's behaviour in disputed areas of the South China Sea, its military intimidation of Taiwan and growing technological competition.\n\nBeijing will not see Mr Biden's competitor as a more promising prospect. While president, Donald Trump started a trade war with China and recently threatened to impose a 60% tariff on Chinese goods if he wins in November.\n\nBut Beijing might like the idea of another Trump presidency. The Biden administration has built an alliance to counter the might of China and he has been clear that the US would defend Taiwan if China tried to take the self-governing island by force.\n\nIn contrast, Mr Trump has refused to say he would help Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its own territory.\n\nChina can exploit these differences in Washington and use them to appear as a safer, long-term diplomatic bet for countries around the world as the two compete for global influence.\n\nBiden's rebuke picked up in Israeli media\n\nBy Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent\n\nPresident Biden called events of the past five months \"gut-wrenching\" in his address.\n\nWhile he blamed Hamas for starting the Gaza war, he stressed the high civilian death toll among Palestinians and had a sharp message for Israel about the need to allow basic supplies to reach the besieged territory, amid UN warnings of mass starvation.\n\nAid, he said, \"cannot be a secondary consideration or a bargaining chip. Protecting and saving innocent lives has to be a priority.\" This rebuke featured prominently in the Israeli media on Friday morning.\n\nDriven by domestic politics in an election year - the need to show stronger American action - as well as deep humanitarian need, Mr Biden announced a plan for a new floating pier off Gaza to bring in food and basic supplies on ships via Cyprus.\n\nIn many ways, this ambitious idea - which the president was careful to say would not involve US military boots on the ground - is a measure of frustration with a key ally.",

        "text": "America worries about health costs \u2014 and voters want to hear from Biden and Republicans\nPresident Joe Biden is counting on outrage over abortion restrictions to help drive turnout for his reelection. Former President Donald Trump is promising to take another swing at repealing Obamacare.\n\nBut around America's kitchen tables, those are hardly the only health topics voters want to hear about in the 2024 campaigns. A new KFF tracking poll shows that health care tops the list of basic expenses Americans worry about \u2014 more than gas, food, and rent. Nearly 3 in 4 adults \u2014 and majorities of both parties \u2014 say they're concerned about paying for unexpected medical bills and other health costs.\n\n\"Absolutely health care is something on my mind,\" Rob Werner, 64, of Concord, New Hampshire, said in an interview at a local coffee shop in January. He's a Biden supporter and said he wants to make sure the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, is retained and that there's more of an effort to control health care costs.\n\nThe presidential election is likely to turn on the simple question of whether Americans want Trump back in the White House. (Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor and U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, remained in the race for the Republican nomination ahead of Super Tuesday, though she had lost the first four primary contests.) And neither major party is basing their campaigns on health care promises.\n\nBut in the KFF poll, 80% of adults said they think it's \"very important\" to hear presidential candidates talk about what they'd do to address health care costs \u2014 a subject congressional and state-level candidates can also expect to address.\n\n\"People are most concerned about out-of-pocket expenses for health care, and rightly so,\" said Andrea Ducas, vice president of health policy at the Center for American Progress, a Washington, D.C.-based progressive think tank.\n\nHere's a look at the major health care issues that could help determine who wins in November.\n\nAbortion\n\nLess than two years after the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion, reproductive health care is shaping up to be the biggest health issue in this election.\n\nThat was also the case in the 2022 midterm elections, when many voters rallied behind candidates who supported abortion rights and bolstered Democrats to an unexpectedly strong showing. Since the Supreme Court's decision, voters in six states \u2014 including Kansas, Kentucky, and Ohio, where Republicans control the legislatures \u2014 have voted on state constitutional amendments regarding abortion access, and the side favoring abortion rights won in each case.\n\nPolls show that abortion is a key issue to some voters, said Robert Blendon, a public opinion researcher and professor emeritus at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. He said up to 30% across the board see it as a \"personal\" issue, rather than policy \u2014 and most of those support abortion rights.\n\n\"That's a lot of voters, if they show up and vote,\" Blendon said.\n\nProposals to further protect \u2014 or restrict \u2014 abortion access could drive voter turnout. Advocates are working to put abortion-related measures on the ballot in such states as Arizona, Florida, Missouri, and South Dakota this November. A push in Washington toward a nationwide abortion policy could also draw more voters to the polls, Blendon said.\n\nA surprise ruling by the Alabama Supreme Court in February that frozen embryos are children could also shake up the election. It's an issue that even divides the anti-abortion community, with some who believe that a fertilized egg is a unique new person deserving of full legal rights and protections, and others believing that discarding unused embryos as part of the in vitro fertilization process is a morally acceptable way for couples to have children.\n\nPricey prescriptions\n\nDrug costs regularly rank high among voters' concerns.\n\nIn the latest tracking poll, more than half \u2014 55% \u2014 said they were very worried about being able to afford prescription drugs.\n\nBiden has tried to address the price of drugs, though his efforts haven't registered with many voters. While its name doesn't suggest landmark health policy, the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, which the president signed in August 2022, included a provision allowing Medicare to negotiate prices for some of the most expensive drugs. It also capped total out-of-pocket spending for prescription drugs for all Medicare patients, while capping the price of insulin for those with diabetes at $35 a month \u2014 a limit some drugmakers have extended to patients with other kinds of insurance.\n\nDrugmakers are fighting the Medicare price negotiation provision in court. Republicans have promised to repeal the IRA, arguing that forcing drugmakers to negotiate lower prices on drugs for Medicare beneficiaries would amount to price controls and stifle innovation. The party has offered no specific alternative, with the GOP-led House focused primarily on targeting pharmacy benefit managers, the arbitrators who control most Americans' insurance coverage for medicines.\n\nCosts of coverage\n\nHealth care costs continue to rise for many Americans. The cost of employer-sponsored health plans have hit new highs in the past few months, raising costs for employers and workers alike. Experts have attributed the increase to high demand and expensive prices for certain drugs and treatments, notably weight loss drugs, as well as to medical inflation.\n\nMeanwhile, the ACA is popular. The KFF poll found that more adults want to see the program expanded than scaled back. And a record 21.3 million people signed up for coverage in 2024, about 5 million of them new customers.\n\nEnrollment in Republican-dominated states has grown fastest, with year-over-year increases of 80% in West Virginia, nearly 76% in Louisiana, and 62% in Ohio, according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.\n\nPublic support for Obamacare and record enrollment in its coverage have made it politically perilous for Republicans to pursue the law's repeal, especially without a robust alternative. That hasn't stopped Trump from raising that prospect on the campaign trail, though it's hard to find any other Republican candidate willing to step out on the same limb.\n\n\"The more he talks about it, the more other candidates have to start answering for it,\" said Jarrett Lewis, a partner at Public Opinion Strategies, a GOP polling firm.\n\n\"Will a conversation about repeal-and-replace resonate with suburban women in Maricopa County?\" he said, referring to the populous county in Arizona known for being a political bellwether. \"I would steer clear of that if I was a candidate.\"\n\nBiden and his campaign have pounced on Trump's talk of repeal. The president has said he wants to make permanent the enhanced premium subsidies he signed into law during the pandemic that are credited with helping to increase enrollment.\n\nRepublican advisers generally recommend that their candidates promote \"a market-based system that has the consumer much more engaged,\" said Lewis, citing short-term insurance plans as an example. \"In the minds of Republicans, there is a pool of people that this would benefit. It may not be beneficial for everyone, but attractive to some.\"\n\nBiden and his allies have criticized short-term insurance plans \u2014 which Trump made more widely available \u2014 as \"junk insurance\" that doesn't cover care for serious conditions or illnesses.\n\nEntitlements are off-limits\n\n\n\nBoth Medicaid and Medicare, the government health insurance programs that cover tens of millions of low-income, disabled, and older people, remain broadly popular with voters, said the Democratic pollster Celinda Lake. That makes it unlikely either party would pursue a platform that includes outright cuts to entitlements. But accusing an opponent of wanting to slash Medicare is a common, and often effective, campaign move.\n\nAlthough Trump has said he wouldn't cut Medicare spending, Democrats will likely seek to associate him with other Republicans who support constraining the program's costs. Polls show that most voters oppose reducing any Medicare benefits, including by raising Medicare's eligibility age from 65. However, raising taxes on people making more than $400,000 a year to shore up Medicare's finances is one idea that won strong backing in a recent poll by The Associated Press and NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\n\nBrian Blase, a former Trump health adviser and the president of Paragon Health Institute, said Republicans, if they win more control of the federal government, should seek to lower spending on Medicare Advantage \u2014 through which commercial insurers provide benefits \u2014 to build on the program's efficiencies and ensure it costs taxpayers less than the traditional program.\n\nSo far, though, Republicans, including Trump, have expressed little interest in such a plan. Some of them are clear-eyed about the perils of running on changing Medicare, which cost $829 billion in 2021 and is projected to consume nearly 18% of the federal budget by 2032.\n\n\"It's difficult to have a frank conversation with voters about the future of the Medicare program,\" said Lewis, the GOP pollster. \"More often than not, it backfires. That conversation will have to happen right after a major election.\"\n\nAddiction crisis\n\nMany Americans have been touched by the growing opioid epidemic, which killed more than 112,000 people in the United States in 2023 \u2014 more than gun deaths and road fatalities combined. Rural residents and white adults are among the hardest hit.\n\nFederal health officials have cited drug overdose deaths as a primary cause of the recent drop in U.S. life expectancy.\n\nRepublicans cast addiction as largely a criminal matter, associating it closely with the migration crisis at the U.S. southern border that they blame on Biden. Democrats have sought more funding for treatment and prevention of substance use disorders.\n\n\"This affects the family, the neighborhood,\" said Blendon, the public opinion researcher.\n\nBillions of dollars have begun to flow to states and local governments from legal settlements with opioid manufacturers and retailers, raising questions about how to best spend that money. But it isn't clear that the crisis, outside the context of immigration, will emerge as a campaign issue.\n\nThis article was updated on March 8, 2024, to clarify that voters in Kansas and Kentucky rejected constitutional amendments that would have denied protections for abortion.\n\nKFF Health News Chief Washington Correspondent Julie Rovner contributed to this report.\n\nKFF Health News, formerly known as Kaiser Health News (KHN), is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF \u2014 the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.",

        "text": "US Presidential Election 2024: Trump, Biden trade salvos in Georgia face-off\nA defiant and bitter Donald Trump returned on Saturday to the state where he faces criminal charges for undermining the 2020 U.S. presidential election, looking to win the battleground of Georgia as a stepping-stone to taking back the presidency.\n\nTrump was stumping in Georgia on the same day as President Joe Biden, who campaigned in nearby Atlanta, signifying the critical role the state will play in November\u2019s general election.\n\nIn his remarks, Trump repeatedly insisted falsely he was the victim of widespread election fraud and he blasted the Georgia district attorney, Fani Willis, who is prosecuting him for interfering with the 2020 election, accusing her of working with the Biden administration to target him.\n\nAlso Read Trump rally loses some steam, US markets end lower, Asia muted \u2013 Global market action at this hour Trump\u2019s Presidency: What it means for the US stock market? Open to lift tariffs if local industry not hurt: Finance Minister Trump 2.0: US President-elect picks Mike Waltz, Marco Rubion- A look at new administration\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to take us out, and it\u2019s not going to work,\u201d Trump told the crowd at an arena in Rome, Georgia.\n\nBiden, meanwhile, took aim at Trump for entertaining Hungary\u2019s right-wing nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban at his Florida club in recent days, accusing him of \u201csucking up to dictators and authoritarian thugs all around the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen he says he wants to be a dictator, I believe him,\u201d Biden said.\n\nThere may not be a more hotly contested state than Georgia in the Nov. 5 general election, which swung to Biden in the 2020 election and was central to Trump\u2019s fraud claims.\n\nTrump is expected to clinch his party\u2019s nomination on Tuesday when Georgia, along with Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington state hold nominating contests.\n\nOn Thursday, Biden delivered a State of the Union speech laden with criticisms of Trump, accusing him of threatening democracy, kowtowing to Russia and sinking bipartisan immigration reform.\n\nThe president, however, continues to grapple with a backlash among Democrats for his staunch support of Israel in its war against Hamas in Gaza, discontent that could manifest itself in the vote in Georgia on Tuesday.\n\nAt his campaign event on Saturday, a heckler was escorted out after calling the president \u201cGenocide Joe.\u201d\n\nA coalition of multifaith and multiracial groups in Georgia have launched a campaign urging voters to leave their ballots blank instead of voting for Biden on Tuesday in the hope of sending a message to the White House to reconsider its support of Israel.\n\nA KEY STATE\n\nTrump\u2019s event was held within the congressional district of right-wing firebrand Marjorie Taylor Greene, who raised eyebrows when she attended Thursday\u2019s State of the Union address clad in Trump attire was given a hero\u2019s welcome by Saturday\u2019s rowdy crowd.\n\n\u201cGeorgia is a key state, it\u2019s a key state in this election,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to work as hard as possible to deliver it for Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nAs he has done in recent speeches, Trump devoted much of his remarks to the situation at the southern U.S. border. He blamed Biden for the death of Laken Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student who was killed last month in Athens, Georgia.\n\nA Venezuelan man who authorities say entered the U.S. illegally has been charged in her death. Members of Riley\u2019s family attended Trump\u2019s rally and some in the crowd held aloft her picture.\n\nBiden mentioned Riley\u2019s murder during his State of the Union remarks. He apologized on Saturday for referring to the suspect as an \u201cillegal.\u201d\n\nChris LaCivita, Trump\u2019s co-campaign manager, said Trump would continue to focus on immigration and the economy in the weeks ahead.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very confident about where we are today, where we\u2019re going to be in November.\u201d LaCivita said. \u201cBecause the issues right now aren\u2019t changing.\u201d\n\nNO FRAUD\n\nBiden edged out Trump in Georgia by just 0.23% in 2020. Georgia Governor Brian Kemp and the state\u2019s top election official, Brad Raffensperger, were adamant that no widespread fraud occurred and that the vote count was legitimate despite Trump\u2019s insistence otherwise.\n\nProsecutors in Georgia allege Trump and his allies engaged in a conspiracy by making false statements about the election and developing a plan to disrupt and delay the congressional certification of the electoral votes. Trump denies the charges.\n\nTrump and his co-defendants are attempting to disqualify Willis from the case, alleging she was involved in an \u201cimproper relationship\u201d with a special prosecutor she named to the case and that she financially benefited from the relationship. Willis has denied the allegations.\n\nLast month, a Fulton County judge heard arguments on Trump\u2019s request and is expected to issue a ruling within days.\n\n\u201cThis whole witchhunt should be put out of its misery and dismissed immediately,\u201d Trump said.\n\nProsecutors have pushed for starting the Trump trial in Georgia as early as August when Trump would be in the heat of the campaign. But it remains unclear whether it will go forward before the election.",

        "text": "Political Violence in Mexico's 2024 Elections: Past and Future\nREAD THE FULL ARTICLE HERE\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nAs Mexico approaches its largest and most significant elections in its recent history, it also faces a concerning and often overlooked phenomenon that could influence the outcome of elections: political violence. This complex problem impacts the very foundations of Mexican democracy.\n\nFrom 2018 to March 2024, 1709 attacks, murders, assassinations, attacks, and threats have been registered in Mexico against people working in politics or government or against government or party facilities.\n\nPolitical violence goes well beyond criminal organizations and cartel dynamics; it results from high levels of impunity, rearrangements between criminal groups, and a lack of the rule of law and protection for politicians and political candidates. With the small willingness of the federal government to handle the issue and a fragile National Electoral Institute (INE) and Electoral Tribunal of the Federal Judiciary (TEPJF), a careful assessment of how to address the problem is necessary.\n\nWith experts arguing that the 2024 elections will be the most violent Mexico has ever seen, more attention needs to be given to this topic. Too much is at stake in Mexico, including Mexican lives. Normalizing political violence is in no one's interest. Politicians, government officials, law enforcement, civil society, and the international community must pay attention.\n\nAccording to data from the Institute for Economics & Peace (IEP), Mexico is one of the most dangerous places in the world to be a local politician. Of the reported incidents in 2022, 62% were intentional attacks against government officials, with some ending in death by way of shootings or beatings. The rest of the attacks were categorized as non-direct, which included riots and internet attacks. This level of violence places Mexico above the global average of intentional attacks against government officials.\n\nPolitical violence includes violence with a political purpose or motivation that creates conflict over political competition and government legitimacy by removing or cowing political dissent. Governments and political parties use it to remain in power or harm their adversaries, and criminal groups use it to intimidate their opponents or garner support for their allied politicians. The logic and nature of political violence depend on the perpetrator and its objectives.\n\nKilling a political candidate or an elected or acting public official is just the tip of the iceberg. Political violence, which stretches beyond electoral cycles, is composed of a wide range of acts, including kidnappings, attacks, and injuries with firearms, personal and family member assaults, intimidation, threats, interception of private communications, and cyberbullying, among others.",

That is why the war will end,\" the conservative premier said after meeting Mr Trump in Florida.\n\nThe former US president has pledged to end the war \"within 24 hours\" if elected - but provided no details.\n\nMr Orban is openly backing his long-term ally in the 2024 White House race.\n\n\"It is obvious that Ukraine cannot stand on its own feet,\" Mr Orban told Hungary's M1 TV channel late on Sunday.\n\n\"If the Americans don't give money and weapons, along with the Europeans, then the war is over. And if the Americans don't give money, the Europeans alone are unable to finance this war. And then the war is over.\"\n\nHe added that Mr Trump had \"pretty detailed plans\" on how to end the Russia-Ukraine war - but did not elaborate. The BBC has asked the Trump campaign for comment.\n\nAs president Mr Trump would have to sign off spending bills that come from Congress. He has in the past expressed scepticism that the US should go on funding Ukraine's defence.\n\nAt their Friday meeting in Mr Trump's Mar-a-Lago mansion, the former US president praised his guest. \"There's nobody that's better, smarter, or a better leader than Viktor Orban. He's fantastic,\" he said.\n\nDuring his US visit, Mr Orban did not meet current US President Joe Biden, who is expected to be Mr Trump's main rival in the presidential elections in November.\n\nIt is highly unusual for a visiting foreign leader to schedule talks with former counterparts without calling on the current leadership.\n\nReuters Ukrainian forces are experiencing big ammunition shortages, as US military aid is stalled\n\nThe Hungarian prime minister has repeatedly drawn strong criticism from fellow EU leaders for maintaining close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, ever since he launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022.\n\nUnlike many other Western nations, Mr Orban refuses to send weapons to its neighbour Ukraine, stating repeatedly that Kyiv is unable to win against a nuclear-armed Russia.\n\nEU leaders are increasingly concerned that a second Trump presidency would see a significant reduction in US military and financial aid to Ukraine and also the Nato military alliance.\n\nA $95bn (\u00a375bn) foreign aid bill - including $60bn in military assistance to Ukraine - has been stalled in US Congress because of Republican opposition.\n\nThe Republicans - openly encouraged by Mr Trump - say they will not allow the bill to clear the final hurdle in the House of Representatives without first agreeing additional funding for US border security.\n\nAt a rally last month he told supporters the cash should be loaned rather than given without strings.\n\n\"They want to give them $60 billion more. Do it this way. Loan them the money. If they can make it, they pay us back.\"\n\nRussian forces have recently made gains in eastern Ukraine, as Kyiv experiences acute shortages in ammunition.",

        "text": "The George Washington Presidential Library Launches New Podcast, \"Inventing the Presidency.\" First Episode Explores Foundations of the American Presidency and First Election\nThe George Washington Presidential Library at Mount Vernon has launched a new podcast that will bring to life how George Washington shaped the U.S. presidency and how the world\u2019s first presidency was often on the brink of falling apart. Inventing the Presidency was released on March 4 for Mount Vernon members and today to the public.\n\n\u201cThe creation of the American presidency stands as one of the most innovative and successful experiments in modern world history,\u201d said Patrick Spero, Executive Director of the George Washington Presidential Library. \u201cThere was no institution similar to the presidency, and it fell upon George Washington to figure out how the presidency would operate in the newly created United States. Our new podcast takes listeners on a behind-the-scenes journey to understand how George Washington established the office and examine how his decisions continue to shape America even today.\u201d\n\nEpisode 1 explores the foundations of the American presidency and the first presidential election, and it includes renowned historians, scholars, and authors, including:\n\nRick Atkinson, Multiple Pulitzer Prize winner and 2020 George Washington Prize winner of The British Are Coming.\n\nLindsay Chervinsky, Presidential Historian and author of the award-winning book, The Cabinet: George Washington and the Creation of an American Institution\n\nPeter Kastor, Professor of History and American Culture Studies at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\nBruce Ragsdale, renowned historian and winner of the 2022 George Washington Prize for his book, Washington at the Plow: The Founding Farmer and the Question of Slavery.\n\nPatrick Spero, Executive Director of the George Washington Presidential Library.\n\nFuture episodes will include Dr. Colin Calloway, Dartmouth Professor of History, Ramin Ganeshram, Executive Director of the Westport Museum, and others.\n\nEpisodes will be released biweekly and are available on Spotify, Apple, YouTube, and other podcast apps.

Open to lift tariffs if local industry not hurt: Finance Minister Trump 2.0: US President-elect picks Mike Waltz, Marco Rubion- A look at new administration\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to take us out, and it\u2019s not going to work,\u201d Trump told the crowd at an arena in Rome, Georgia.\n\nBiden, meanwhile, took aim at Trump for entertaining Hungary\u2019s right-wing nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban at his Florida club in recent days, accusing him of \u201csucking up to dictators and authoritarian thugs all around the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen he says he wants to be a dictator, I believe him,\u201d Biden said.\n\nThere may not be a more hotly contested state than Georgia in the Nov. 5 general election, which swung to Biden in the 2020 election and was central to Trump\u2019s fraud claims.\n\nTrump is expected to clinch his party\u2019s nomination on Tuesday when Georgia, along with Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington state hold nominating contests.\n\nOn Thursday, Biden delivered a State of the Union speech laden with criticisms of Trump, accusing him of threatening democracy, kowtowing to Russia and sinking bipartisan immigration reform.\n\nThe president, however, continues to grapple with a backlash among Democrats for his staunch support of Israel in its war against Hamas in Gaza, discontent that could manifest itself in the vote in Georgia on Tuesday.\n\nAt his campaign event on Saturday, a heckler was escorted out after calling the president \u201cGenocide Joe.\u201d\n\nA coalition of multifaith and multiracial groups in Georgia have launched a campaign urging voters to leave their ballots blank instead of voting for Biden on Tuesday in the hope of sending a message to the White House to reconsider its support of Israel.\n\nA KEY STATE\n\nTrump\u2019s event was held within the congressional district of right-wing firebrand Marjorie Taylor Greene, who raised eyebrows when she attended Thursday\u2019s State of the Union address clad in Trump attire was given a hero\u2019s welcome by Saturday\u2019s rowdy crowd.\n\n\u201cGeorgia is a key state, it\u2019s a key state in this election,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to work as hard as possible to deliver it for Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nAs he has done in recent speeches, Trump devoted much of his remarks to the situation at the southern U.S. border. He blamed Biden for the death of Laken Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student who was killed last month in Athens, Georgia.\n\nA Venezuelan man who authorities say entered the U.S. illegally has been charged in her death. Members of Riley\u2019s family attended Trump\u2019s rally and some in the crowd held aloft her picture.\n\nBiden mentioned Riley\u2019s murder during his State of the Union remarks. He apologized on Saturday for referring to the suspect as an \u201cillegal.\u201d\n\nChris LaCivita, Trump\u2019s co-campaign manager, said Trump would continue to focus on immigration and the economy in the weeks ahead.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very confident about where we are today, where we\u2019re going to be in November.\u201d LaCivita said. \u201cBecause the issues right now aren\u2019t changing.\u201d\n\nNO FRAUD\n\nBiden edged out Trump in Georgia by just 0.23% in 2020. Georgia Governor Brian Kemp and the state\u2019s top election official, Brad Raffensperger, were adamant that no widespread fraud occurred and that the vote count was legitimate despite Trump\u2019s insistence otherwise.\n\nProsecutors in Georgia allege Trump and his allies engaged in a conspiracy by making false statements about the election and developing a plan to disrupt and delay the congressional certification of the electoral votes. Trump denies the charges.\n\nTrump and his co-defendants are attempting to disqualify Willis from the case, alleging she was involved in an \u201cimproper relationship\u201d with a special prosecutor she named to the case and that she financially benefited from the relationship. Willis has denied the allegations.\n\nLast month, a Fulton County judge heard arguments on Trump\u2019s request and is expected to issue a ruling within days.\n\n\u201cThis whole witchhunt should be put out of its misery and dismissed immediately,\u201d Trump said.\n\nProsecutors have pushed for starting the Trump trial in Georgia as early as August when Trump would be in the heat of the campaign. But it remains unclear whether it will go forward before the election.",

        "text": "Social Media Politics\nSocial media and social networking services are integrated into the American political process and have profoundly influenced political communication and participation. Social media platforms have transformed the political landscape by revolutionizing information dissemination, citizen engagement, and public opinion formation and change. Politicians use social media to communicate directly with voters in an unmediated and unfiltered manner. Comparatively, voters use social media to follow the latest messaging from politicians accompanied by demonstrating their support for particular politicians.\n\nThis book is a comprehensive examination of the role of digital and social media in the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Political discourse during the 2020 election revealed political disharmony and a deep political division among vast swaths of Americans that was powered, in part, by social media. This book reveals how digital and social media have reshaped power dynamics by altering the relationships among citizens, politicians, and traditional media outlets, the emergence of new influencers, and the impact of online activism on policy agendas.\n\nThis book, Social Media Politics, includes scholars with varied backgrounds and experience, using both quantitative and qualitative methodologies, from leading research institutions around the nation. Students, scholars, and practitioners will gain new knowledge to more clearly understand the role social media played in the 2020 presidential campaign.",

Yellen.\u00a0\u201cThe investments in the President\u2019s budget are fully paid for, and the budget would reduce deficits by approximately $3 trillion through a combination of smart savings and tax proposals that ensure wealthy individuals and large corporations pay their fair share.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Under President Biden, the United States has experienced historic economic progress. Thanks to President Biden\u2019s policies, the U.S. saw the fastest, most equitable economic recovery in its history. The President\u2019s long-term strategies have since sustained an unemployment rate below 4% for more than two years, the longest stretch in more than 50 years, increased real wages for Americans to above pre-pandemic levels, reduced inflation by more than 2/3 from its peak, and led to robust GDP growth which has blown past expectations.\u00a0The President\u2019s FY25 budget will build on this momentum by continuing to lower costs for working families, investing in America and the American people, protecting and strengthening Social Security and Medicare, and further reducing the deficit by cracking down on tax evasion by the wealthy, cutting wasteful spending, and making the wealthy and corporations pay their fair share.\u00a0The Administration\u2019s revenue proposals would ensure that the wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share and, in doing so, fully pay for the investments proposed in the President\u2019s Budget while generating roughly $3 trillion in additional deficit reduction over the next decade. The proposals would also lower costs by expanding key tax credits for workers and families.Key revenue proposals in the Greenbook would:Ensure the wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share, by:Implementing a global minimum tax that will strengthen the taxation of corporations\u2019 foreign income by ensuring that all multinationals pay at least a 21% minimum rate on their earnings in each jurisdiction, thereby stopping the race to the bottom on corporate tax rates and leveling the playing field for U.S. businesses.Increasing the corporate minimum tax rate to 21% to align with the global minimum tax rate.Implementing a Billionaire Minimum Tax of 25% on the wealthiest taxpayers to ensure the top 0.01 percent pay taxes on their income as they go, just like everyone who earns a paycheck.Raising the tax rate on corporate stock buybacks from 1% to 4% to reduce the differential tax treatment between buybacks and dividends and encourage businesses to reinvest profits in their workers and in the company\u2019s growth.Denying corporate tax deductions for employee compensation in excess of $1 million paid to any employee by both publicly and privately owned C corporations.\u00a0Closing Medicare tax loopholes and extending solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund indefinitely by expanding the Net Investment Income Tax on income over $400,000 to cover all pass-through business income not otherwise covered by the Net Investment Income Tax or self-employment taxes, and by increasing the additional Medicare tax rate and the Net Investment Income Tax rate by 1.2 percentage points above $400,000 for a total Medicare tax rate of 5% on high-income taxpayers.Lower costs for workers and families, by:Making permanent expanded tax credits for health insurance\u00a0that were first enacted in the American Rescue Plan and extended in the Inflation Reduction Act.Expanding the Child Tax Credit and making it fully refundable and available in advance monthly, a more practical solution to ensure that families can receive relief when they need it most instead of in one lump sum at the end of the year. In 2021, the expanded CTC cut child poverty nearly in half and helped bring child poverty to a historic low.\u00a0Expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit to cover more workers without children.Expanding and enhancing the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit,\u00a0the largest federal incentive for affordable housing construction and rehabilitation, to boost the supply of housing that is affordable for low-income renters.Make additional smart, common-sense reforms to the tax code.Close the carried interest loophole that allows investment fund managers to reduce the taxes they owe on their earnings by characterizing them as investment gains rather than wages.\u00a0Close estate and gift tax loopholes\u00a0that allow the wealthy to reduce their tax by using complicated trust arrangements to transfer their assets to their heirs.Close life insurance loopholes that allow the wealthy to avoid tax on what are effectively customized investment products.\u00a0\u00a0###",

        "text": "President Biden wants to give homebuyers a $10,000 tax credit. Here's who would qualify.\nBuying a home has become increasingly out of reach for Americans, who are grappling with a double whammy of high interest rates and surging home values. In his State of the Union address on Thursday, President Joe Biden proposed a new tax credit that would provide $10,000 to first-time home buyers.\n\nBiden is also proposing a separate $10,000 tax credit for current homeowners who sell their \"starter home\" in order to jump into a bigger house. That could help melt a real estate market in which homeowners who locked in low mortgage rates during the pandemic and are hesitant to move because they now face significantly higher mortgage rates.\n\nBiden's proposals \u2014 which must be enacted by Congress \u2014 were cheered by advocates of affordable housing, with National Housing Council CEO David M. Dworkin calling it \"the most consequential State of the Union address on housing in more than 50 years.\" On a practical level, the tax credits would lower the cost of purchasing a home, an issue that affects Americans of all ages and stripes.\n\n\"Housing affordability has become a key issue for Americans spanning all demographics and political divides, and housing policy has mostly remained steady in recent congressional budgets,\" noted Moody's associate economist Nick Luettke in a report touching on Biden's efforts.\n\nHere's what to know about the proposals.\n\nWhat are Biden's homebuying tax credits?\n\nBiden is proposing two tax credits aimed at helping Americans buy homes at a time when housing affordability is near an all-time low.\n\nCurrently, Americans must earn a six-figure salary to comfortably buy a typical home, compared with $59,000 just four years ago. Home prices have surged about 27% since the start of the pandemic, while mortgage rates have spiked, making it costlier to purchase.\n\nTo help offset the cost of buying a home, Biden is proposing the following tax credits:\n\nA first-time homebuyer tax credit of $10,000\n\nA one-year tax credit of up to $10,000 to current homeowners who sell their starter homes\n\n\n\nThe tax credits are viewed as a bridge to help people afford a home while mortgage rates are high. As a result, they wouldn't be permanent, but instead would be offered for homebuyers who purchase properties in 2024 or 2025, a senior Biden administration official told CBS MoneyWatch.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is expected to cut its key interest rate later this year, which would ease the cost of borrowing for all types of loans, from mortgages to credit cards.\n\nWho would qualify for the tax credits?\n\nFirst-time homebuyers would qualify for an annual tax credit of $5,000 per year for two years, for a total of $10,000.\n\nThe one-year tax credit for current homeowners would be available to people who own starter homes, defined as homes below the median home price in their county. The owners would have to sell to another owner-occupant, rather than an investor, according to the White House.\n\nBoth tax credits are geared toward \"middle-class families,\" with the Biden administration official telling CBS MoneyWatch that the credits would be limited to households earning less than $200,000.\n\nHow would the tax credits impact the housing market?\n\nThe Biden administration said the tax credits would help unfreeze the real estate market and make homebuying more affordable for millions.\n\nThe first-time buyer tax credit could help 3.5 million middle-class families buy their first home, with the tax credit providing an equivalent reduction of about 1.5 percentage point for two years on the median-priced home, the White House said in a statement. The homeowner tax credit would help about 3 million families buy a bigger home, it added.\n\n\"Many homeowners have lower rates on their mortgages than current rates,\" the White House said. \"This 'lock-in' effect makes homeowners more reluctant to sell and give up that low rate, even in circumstances where their current homes no longer fit their household needs.\"\n\nWhen would these tax credits go into effect?\n\nThat's unclear, because Congress would need to pass legislation to change the tax code \u2014 an uphill climb as Democrats and Republicans spar ahead of the November election.\n\nPassing tax credits could be \"a particularly arduous task in an election year \u2013 though their inclusion in the address underscores the salience of the skyrocketing cost of housing for Americans nationwide,\" noted Luettke of Moody's.\n\nThe White House wants to see Congress pass legislation to enact the tax credits this year, which would allow homebuyers and homeowners to receive the tax credits starting in the 2024 tax year. Homebuyers would receive the credit for a two-year period that they could claim on their tax returns starting with either the 2024 or 2025 tax year, the Biden official said.\n\nAre there tax credits for building new homes?\n\nYes, Biden also proposed several new efforts to fund the construction of affordable homes and rental units. That includes a new Neighborhood Homes Tax Credit, which would provide an incentive to build or renovate so-called \"starter homes,\" or properties geared for first-time homebuyers.\n\nThe White House said the plan would lead to the construction of 2 million new units.\n\nSuch proposals to build new homes and rental units may be more effective in dealing with the housing crisis than tax credits for homebuyers, some experts said. Because of underbuilding during the past decade, there is a severe undersupply of housing across the U.S.\n\n\"Ultimately, the president's most substantial comments made about housing were those related to new construction,\" said LendingTree chief economist Jacob Channel in an email. \"High home prices in the United States are largely a function of the fact that we simply do not have enough housing supply to meet demand and bring prices down.\"",

        "text": "Cornell expert says Trump\u2019s frequent phonemic paraphasia \u2018are signs of early dementia\u2019\n\u201cIn the 2024 election, both party candidates have been accused by the other of having psychological deficits. This weaponizing of clinical concepts is no doubt confusing to voters and journalists. A careful consideration of these claims can demystify their use as \u2018opposition research.\u2019\n\n\u201cObjectively, Donald Trump has a documented history of lying that is so marked as to be considered 'pathological.' Politicians often say untrue things, but the frequency of Trump\u2019s lying is so extreme as to meet criteria for sociopathic behavior, since he tells falsehoods across all life domains, from his personal relationships to business dealings and finally to politics. Recently, several clinicians have noted the ways he has begun to mistake words, lose his train of thought, confuse Biden with Obama, particularly during long rallies held in the evening. There are examples of phonemic paraphasia \u2013 swapping parts of words for others that sound similar; these are signs of early dementia, even though they are intermittent.\n\n\u201cThe complaints about Joe Biden have been more vague \u2013 citing his advanced age, physical fragility and occasional mixing up of names. But there is no evidence of dementia onset, no \u2018sun-downing,\u2019 no reports from staff or cabinet members that he is failing to stay on top of legislative or international issues. This in contrast to Trump whose cabinet at the end of his term considered invoking the 25th amendment.\n\n\u201cThis is not a partisan take. If the figures here were reversed, I would make the same judgment.\u201d",

        "text": "US manufacturing outlook: Better times are coming\nTrump initiated tariffs on steel and aluminum imports in 2018 under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. This law allowed the president to raise tariffs on imports that pose a threat to national security without having to win the approval of Congress. As the likely Republican Party candidate, Donald Trump has proposed a 10% tariff on all US imports, with 60% tariffs on Chinese imports, as part of his election campaign. However, he may need Congressional approval this time around for such broad-based implementation of tariffs. There is likely to be opposition from both sides within Congress, with the strong prospect of retaliatory tariffs from trade partners. Consequently, there is a chance the proposals are watered down.\n\nWhile blocking Chinese competition may help the US auto sector, 10% tariffs would significantly inflate costs in most industries and could end up hurting US exporters if we see tit-for-tat reprisals from trade partners. In 2023, the US exported around $1.8tr of manufactured goods, the largest categories being automotive and parts ($180bn), civilian aircraft, parts and engines ($130bn), pharmaceuticals ($100bn) with chemicals and technology-related products also making significant contributions. The US imported around $2.8tr of manufactured items, including $440bn of automotive vehicles, parts and engines, $90bn of computers, $100bn of civilian aircraft, parts and engines, $120bn of cell phones and $200bn of pharmaceuticals.\n\nThe aim would be to boost US manufacturing competitiveness and this could marginally incentivise re-shoring, but any shift in the production base is going to be costly in the near-term and could lead to rising inflation over and above that implied by tariffs alone. This will have knock on effects more broadly for the US economy. Depending on the scale of retaliation, it could also be economically damaging, particularly for major exporters such as aerospace and food producers \u2013 a sector China specifically targeted in 2018-2020 in response to US tariffs on steel and aluminum.\n\nA 10% tariff on $3tr of imports implies a tax hike equivalent to $300bn for the manufacturing sector to bear. Consumers will end up paying the bulk, but it will be painful for many manufacturing with some squeeze on profit margins likely amongst both producers and retailers. Looking more broadly, the US economy is $28tr in size and tariff costs to the tune of around 1% of GDP will be a headwind. How much of a headwind depends on what the government chooses to do with those revenues. Will it be used to purely shrink the deficit or will we see taxes cut elsewhere?",

        "text": "Political Violence in Mexico's 2024 Elections: Past and Future\nREAD THE FULL ARTICLE HERE\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nAs Mexico approaches its largest and most significant elections in its recent history, it also faces a concerning and often overlooked phenomenon that could influence the outcome of elections: political violence. This complex problem impacts the very foundations of Mexican democracy.\n\nFrom 2018 to March 2024, 1709 attacks, murders, assassinations, attacks, and threats have been registered in Mexico against people working in politics or government or against government or party facilities.\n\nPolitical violence goes well beyond criminal organizations and cartel dynamics; it results from high levels of impunity, rearrangements between criminal groups, and a lack of the rule of law and protection for politicians and political candidates. With the small willingness of the federal government to handle the issue and a fragile National Electoral Institute (INE) and Electoral Tribunal of the Federal Judiciary (TEPJF), a careful assessment of how to address the problem is necessary.\n\nWith experts arguing that the 2024 elections will be the most violent Mexico has ever seen, more attention needs to be given to this topic. Too much is at stake in Mexico, including Mexican lives. Normalizing political violence is in no one's interest. Politicians, government officials, law enforcement, civil society, and the international community must pay attention.\n\nAccording to data from the Institute for Economics & Peace (IEP), Mexico is one of the most dangerous places in the world to be a local politician. Of the reported incidents in 2022, 62% were intentional attacks against government officials, with some ending in death by way of shootings or beatings. The rest of the attacks were categorized as non-direct, which included riots and internet attacks. This level of violence places Mexico above the global average of intentional attacks against government officials.\n\nPolitical violence includes violence with a political purpose or motivation that creates conflict over political competition and government legitimacy by removing or cowing political dissent. Governments and political parties use it to remain in power or harm their adversaries, and criminal groups use it to intimidate their opponents or garner support for their allied politicians. The logic and nature of political violence depend on the perpetrator and its objectives.\n\nKilling a political candidate or an elected or acting public official is just the tip of the iceberg. Political violence, which stretches beyond electoral cycles, is composed of a wide range of acts, including kidnappings, attacks, and injuries with firearms, personal and family member assaults, intimidation, threats, interception of private communications, and cyberbullying, among others.",

        "text": "Explaining the Trump immunity case at the Supreme Court\nOn April 25, 2024, Supreme Court will consider former President Donald Trump\u2019s claims of immunity from conspiracy and obstruction charges related to the 2020 presidential election. Here is a breakdown of the second high-profile case involving Trump at the Court this year.\n\nEarlier this month, the Supreme Court decided in Trump v. Anderson that Colorado could not block the former president from appearing on its primary ballot.\n\nThe immunity case in Donald J. Trump v. United States will center on one simple sentence: \u201cwhether and if so to what extent does a former President enjoy presidential immunity from criminal prosecution for conduct alleged to involve official acts during his tenure in office.\u201d\n\nAfter an appeals court decision gave Special Counsel Jack L. Smith the green light to initiate a conspiracy and obstruction trial against Trump, his attorneys sought a stay of that decision. (On Nov. 18, 2022, Attorney General Merrick B. Garland appointed Smith to serve as the Special Counsel in the case.)\n\nNCC Podcast: Is President Trump Immune From Prosecution?\n\nHere are the arguments made by both sides in presenting their cases to the justices. To be sure, a torrent of other briefs will arrive at the Court in the next month or so; briefs will be accepted at the Court until April 15, 2024. But both teams need to parse from that one sentence the key facts the justices will consider during arguments.\n\nThe case from Trump\u2019s team\n\nIn August 2023, a grand jury indicted Trump on four charges related to his actions after the 2020 presidential election. On Feb. 6, 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled that Smith could move forward with a trial.\n\n\u201cFor the purpose of this criminal case, former President Trump has become citizen Trump, with all of the defenses of any other criminal defendant. But any executive immunity that may have protected him while he served as President no longer protects him against this prosecution,\u201d concluded a unanimous three-judge District of Columbia Circuit appeals court panel.\n\nOn Feb. 12, the former president\u2019s attorneys sought a stay of the decision form the U.S. Supreme Court. Trump\u2019s stay petition asked the Court to consider if Trump had undertaken official acts \u201cperformed within the \u2018outer perimeter\u2019 of his official responsibility.\u201d The petition also argued that Trump already had been tried for the alleged Jan. 6 acts during his Senate impeachment proceedings, and he could not be tried a second time.\n\nOn Feb. 28, the Supreme Court granted a stay and limited the arguments in the case to the single issue of presidential immunity.\n\nTrump\u2019s team has asked the Supreme Court to look closely at the immunity question. \u201cThe panel opinion \u2026 like the district court, concludes that Presidential immunity from prosecution for official acts does not exist at all. This is a stunning breach of precedent and historical norms. In 234 years of American history, no President was ever prosecuted for his official acts. Nor should they be,\u201d they argued. Trump\u2019s attorneys also claim that grand jury indictment against Trump was based on \u201cfive types of conduct, all constituting official acts of the President.\u201d\n\nIn the stay petition, former President Trump pointed to Fitzgerald v. Nixon, a Supreme Court decision from 1982, as establishing presidential immunity precedents. Fitzgerald had been fired from a government position after testifying to Congress about Air Force cost overruns, and Fitzgerald later filed a civil lawsuit against former President Richard Nixon.\n\nIn his 5-4 majority opinion, Justice Lewis Powell said that Nixon, as \u201ca former President of the United States, is entitled to absolute immunity from damages liability predicated on his official acts.\u201d Powell also pointed to two cases, Barr v. Matteo (1959) and Stump v. Sparkman (1978) to determine that \u201cthe President\u2019s absolute immunity extends to all acts within the \u2018outer perimeter\u2019 of his duties of office.\u201d\n\nIn a reply brief, Trump\u2019s team also claimed that under Marbury v. Madison, all courts created under Article III of the Constitution lacked the power to consider a president\u2019s official discretionary acts.\n\nThe arguments from Special Counsel Smith\n\nThe United States and Special Counsel Smith rejected Trump\u2019s main arguments in its brief prior to the Court\u2019s stay decision.\n\nOn the issue of immunity based on the \u201couter perimeter\u201d of official presidential duties, Smith was blunt: \u201cThat position finds no support in constitutional text, separation-of-powers principles, history, or logic. And if that radical claim were accepted, it would upend understandings about Presidential accountability that have prevailed throughout history while undermining democracy and the rule of law.\u201d\n\nSmith stated the Fitzgerald precedent was narrow and applied to civil cases only. \u201cFitzgerald\u2019s concern that potential exposure to private civil damages actions would chill a President\u2019s decision-making, to the detriment of the vigorous exercise of executive authority, does not apply to the context of federal criminal prosecution.\u201d\n\nHe also quoted in part a dissent from Justice Clarence Thomas in Trump v. Vance (2020), a case where Trump objected to a subpoena for his financial records from the district attorney for the County of New York. \u201cThis Court has recognized absolute immunity for the President from \u2018damages liability predicated on his official acts,\u2019\u201d Thomas wrote. \u201cBut we have rejected absolute immunity from damages actions for a President\u2019s nonofficial conduct, Clinton v. Jones (1997).\u201d\n\nSmith also wrote that while \u201ccourts cannot enter an injunction against a sitting President directing his performance of official acts,\u201d such protection \u201cdoes not suggest that courts are disabled from holding a former President accountable when his actions violate federal criminal law.\u201d\n\nHe also disputed the Trump team\u2019s interpretation of Marbury v. Madison, pointing to \u201cthe long record of this Court\u2019s review of the lawfulness of Presidential acts,\u201d such as the Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer decision in 1952.\n\nSmith concluded that \u201cPresidents, like other citizens, must comply with federal criminal law. Nothing in the respect appropriately shown to a sitting President\u2019s discretionary official acts implies that a former President has immunity from all personal accountability for crimes committed through the exercise of official power.\u201d\n\nCourt briefs filed over the next month will focus on the questions of what constitutes an official act of a president; which acts are within the outer perimeter of a president\u2019s duties; and the liability of former presidents to criminal prosecution for conduct while in office.\n\nTrump v. United States will be heard on the last day of scheduled arguments this term, and the Court is expected to issue its final decisions for the current term in late June.\n\nScott Bomboy is the editor in chief of the National Constitution Center.",

        "text": "Occupied Ukraine encouraged to vote in Russian election by armed men\nOccupied Ukraine encouraged to vote in Russian election by armed men\n\nRussian-controlled Donetsk election commission People in occupied Ukraine are being strongly encouraged to vote in Russia's upcoming presidential elections - which Putin is expected to win\n\nMoscow has launched a wide-ranging campaign telling residents of occupied parts of Ukraine to vote in Russia's presidential election.\n\nFor the first time, the national vote is taking place over three days (15-17 March), but additional early voting has already begun in the occupied parts of four Ukrainian regions: Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, Donetsk and Luhansk.\n\nOne resident complained of pro-Russian collaborators with ballot boxes going from house to house looking for voters accompanied by armed soldiers.\n\nVladimir Putin will certainly win another term of office, but a high turnout would help the Kremlin's efforts to legitimise his continued rule.\n\nIt would also be used to justify Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nVladimir Putin is one of four candidates on the ballot, but none of the others poses a realistic challenge.\n\nAll of his most outspoken critics have either been forced into exile, jailed, or have died.\n\nCoerced into voting\n\nVoting normally starts early in remote parts of Russia, but the procedure has been extended to the four partially occupied regions of Ukraine \"for security reasons\".\n\nThere are a variety of ways in which Ukrainians under occupation are being coerced into voting.\n\nTavria TV Authorities are setting up free concerts and food to entice voters to polling stations, a tactic used in the Soviet era\n\nEven though occupation authorities have set up polling stations, voters are not required to visit them as those same authorities have dispatched people with ballot boxes to their homes.\n\n\"Dear voters, we worry about your safety! You do not have to go anywhere to vote - we will come to your home with ballots and boxes!\" the Russia-installed electoral commission in the Zaporizhzhia region said on social media.\n\nUkrainians under occupation are also put under pressure through a pro-vote campaign called InformUIK, ostensibly designed to inform them about the procedure of voting, as well as all the candidates.\n\nIt seeks to visit all remaining residents of Russian-occupied regions at home - and its representatives are often accompanied by armed men.\n\nThey collect personal data to compile lists of voters, and sometimes film local residents during such visits. Russia's electoral chief in the partly occupied Zaporizhzhia region acknowledged that locals were worried about the filming.\n\nUkrainians have already come under considerable pressure to take Russian passports, but Ukrainian passports are being accepted as proof of ID to make voting even easier.\n\nRussian-controlled Kherson election commission In occupied Ukraine, people don't have to go to vote - the ballot boxes find them\n\nResidents have been sent text messages informing them of the dates of the vote and tried-and-tested Soviet methods are also being deployed to attract them to polling stations, such as free concerts and food.\n\n'It is abnormal when citizens collaborate'\n\nUkraine has dismissed the vote as an illegitimate sham, and those involved in organising it have been targeted by attacks.\n\nThe day early voting started in occupied parts of the Kherson region, on 27 February, there were two explosions in Nova Kakhovka: one targeting the offices of the Kremlin's United Russia party, and the other near a polling station.\n\nThen last week Ukraine's Main Intelligence Directorate said a local woman helping the Russian administration hold the election had been \"liquidated\" in a car bombing on 6 March in the occupied town of Berdyansk in the Zaporizhzhia region.\n\nAsked about who carried out the attack, the Ukrainian governor of the Zaporizhzhia region, Ivan Fedorov, told the BBC: \"Somebody did it. Somebody who showed great resistance. Some heroes who do it on temporarily occupied territories.\n\n\"Our resistance shows that it is abnormal when our citizens collaborate with Russians. Somebody did not understand. That's why this somebody got killed.\"\n\nUkrainian intelligence Ukrainian military intelligence announced last week that a woman who had helped with the voting had been \"liquidated\" in a car bombing\n\nWhen asked to clarify if people behind the attack were linked to the Ukrainian state, Mr Fedorov added: \"Yes, of course. There is great co-operation between our resistance inside the temporarily occupied territories and our secret services.\"\n\nWhile Russia-installed officials and media in occupied parts of Ukraine are busy promoting the vote, they do not focus too much on drumming up support for any particular candidate - and they don't need to.\n\nVladimir Putin is the mastermind of these regions' annexation by Russia, and nationally the vote is being presented as an endorsement.\n\nThe official symbol of the 2024 presidential election is the V-sign associated with his \"special military operation\" in Ukraine. The official slogan adopted by Russia's Central Electoral Commission is \"Strong together - vote for Russia!\"\n\nBoth the V symbol and the slogan appear in posters dotted around occupied parts of Ukraine, including at polling stations.\n\nKremlin media have already trumpeted early voting in Ukraine as a resounding success.\n\n'This isn't democracy, it's a comedy show'\n\n\"It was a real holiday! With music, balloons and Russian flags!\" the Komsomolskaya Pravda tabloid said of the early voting campaign in the Kherson region, which concluded on 3 March. \"Tens of thousands of people!\"\n\nKremlin propaganda is using the election to paint a picture of unanimous support for Russia's invasion and annexation of Ukraine.\n\nBut these carefully choreographed images come at the expense of thousands of critics silenced, deported, jailed or killed. Many have left - especially young people - unwilling or unable to live under Russian occupation because of their views.\n\nRussian-controlled Kherson election commission The V symbol is everywhere in occupied Ukraine for this election - including polling stations and election leaflets\n\nUkraine's Zaporizhzhia governor, Ivan Fedorov, says local residents of his partly occupied region are being intimidated into voting: \"They go to every flat and every house and ask - would you like to vote?\n\n\"Our citizens are very afraid. Of course if Russians with soldiers come to their flat and ask if they'd like to vote for Putin, everyone will say: OK, yes. Because everyone wants to save their life. But it does not mean that our citizens want to support Putin.\"\n\nOne resident of the Kherson region - the south-eastern part which is occupied by Russian forces - described to the BBC how voting was organised in his village.\n\nWe are unable to disclose his name or location due to security concerns.\n\n\"Pro-Russian locals visit households with ballot boxes, accompanied by armed military men. If they knock and no one opens, they move on to the next house. They don't break into houses, but they do visit,\" the local resident said.",

        "text": "Trump leads Biden narrowly in Georgia as general election comes into focus \u2014 CBS News Battleground poll\nWith President Biden and Donald Trump on the verge of clinching the presidential nomination, their rematch in Georgia in the general election looks like another close race. Trump is just ahead of Mr. Biden in likely voters' current preferences, with a three-point lead that is within the margin of error. This edge is driven by a small group of Mr. Biden's 2020 voters switching to Trump, boosted by favorable views of how Trump's policies would affect Georgians' pocketbooks.\n\nThe president's message in his State of the Union address that democracy is under threat at home may resonate with Democrats, but voters in Georgia are likelier to say it's Trump than Mr. Biden who would strengthen U.S. democracy. In fact, Mr. Biden's numbers on this issue are net negative, with a third of his own voters saying his second-term policies wouldn't make a difference.\n\nTrump's numbers on democracy are driven by his own voters, many of whom still believe there was widespread voter fraud in Georgia in 2020. Another reason Trump's backers might give him the edge on democracy is the widespread feeling among them that the charges and indictments against him are politically motivated.\n\nDemocrats are also trying to raise the salience of abortion access after the Dobbs decision, keeping it on voters' radars. A majority of Georgia voters would prefer abortions in the state to be mostly, if not entirely, legal, but they are by no means all voting Democratic. About three in 10 of them currently prefer Trump to Mr. Biden, but this is another group to watch as the campaign unfolds.\n\nAt the same time, most say that Mr. Biden is not focused enough on inflation and the U.S.-Mexico border, and these views are correlated with voting intentions. Biden 2020 voters who don't think he's paying enough attention to these issues are more likely to be backing Trump today than those who say Mr. Biden's focus is about right.\n\nPersuasion and turnout\n\nIn 2020, Georgia went blue for the first time in decades, albeit very narrowly, with Mr. Biden beating Trump by under 12,000 votes \u2014 about a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThere is a turnout gap emerging early on, setting up a campaign not just of persuasion, but also motivation: Republicans and Trump 2020 voters are likelier than Democrats and Biden 2020 voters to say they will \"definitely\" vote.\n\nAnd Republicans are currently thinking about the race more than Democrats.\n\nMost voters here already report thinking about the presidential race \"a lot\" \u2014 perhaps partly due to the primaries occurring now. And while the vast majority of voters are planning to turn out this fall. This six-point turnout gap results in a likely 2024 electorate with a slightly higher share of Trump '20 voters.\n\nOn top of that, more Biden '20 voters than Trump '20 voters are now thinking of voting for the other party. To be clear, these voters constitute small but highly consequential slivers of the electorate. And Trump's current lead is more attributable to persuasion than differential turnout.\n\nTrump indictments\n\nThe lion's share of Trump's backers would still consider him fit for the presidency if he were eventually found guilty of trying to overturn the 2020 election. (This is also the case among Trump's primary voters in recent GOP nominating contests.) About one in five of his supporters in Georgia say they wouldn't consider him fit if he were found guilty by a court.\n\nCould a conviction, if it happened, change any minds? The evidence is mixed. Trump voters who say they wouldn't consider him fit don't have positive evaluations for Mr. Biden, and they also express concerns about Mr. Biden's mental and physical fitness. This group may be asked to pick between two men they consider unfit for the job, albeit for different reasons.\n\nOverall, voters across the state are more mixed on the Trump charges. There is slightly more concern that the charges are politically motivated than concern that he actually tried to overturn the election. But most say they wouldn't consider him fit to be president if he were found guilty.\n\nWho is switching?\n\nOne of the more noticeable shifts comes from the diverse suburbs around Atlanta. Voters in this competitive part of the state were critical to Mr. Biden's success four years ago, but they now lean Trump's way.\n\nMore generally, Trump's support has improved a bit among voters of color. While the gains are modest and Mr. Biden still has a big lead among them, every potential blue-to-red switch matters in a close race.\n\nMost Black voters feel Trump is trying to earn Black support. Black voters make up nearly a third of Georgia's electorate, and 17% of them today are picking Trump over Mr. Biden \u2014 that's a modest improvement from Trump's 2020 showing in the state. Mr. Biden's path to victory in the state relies on maintaining dominant margins among this key group. This is a key group to watch, because it would be much harder for the president to replicate his 2020 performance if more of them switch their support, or if a substantial segment of Black voters aren't motivated to turn out this year.\n\nAside from voters of color, voters under 50 and men who voted for Mr. Biden four years ago are the likelier groups to be considering switching to Trump. Switching to Trump is also more prevalent among self-described moderates and independents, as well as voters who say Mr. Biden winning wouldn't make a difference to the strength of U.S. democracy.\n\nOur data also shows some of the challenges ahead for the Biden campaign: mobilize more voters in these key segments of their 2020 coalition to turn out and back the president again, or at least, cast a vote against Trump. These challenges become more difficult if swing voters are more focused on inflation and pocketbook issues than on larger themes of democracy and rights.\n\nUnlike national economic sentiment, views of Georgia's economy are net positive among voters in the state. And Gov. Brian Kemp enjoys very positive evaluations from voters, with about two thirds approving of the job he is doing. That includes roughly half of Democratic voters.\n\nThis CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a statewide representative sample of 1,133 registered voters in Georgia interviewed between March 4-11, 2024. The sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, education and geographic region, based on U.S. Census data and voter files, as well as to past vote. The margin of error is \u00b13.9 points.\n\nToplines",

Our new podcast takes listeners on a behind-the-scenes journey to understand how George Washington established the office and examine how his decisions continue to shape America even today.\u201d\n\nEpisode 1 explores the foundations of the American presidency and the first presidential election, and it includes renowned historians, scholars, and authors, including:\n\nRick Atkinson, Multiple Pulitzer Prize winner and 2020 George Washington Prize winner of The British Are Coming.\n\nLindsay Chervinsky, Presidential Historian and author of the award-winning book, The Cabinet: George Washington and the Creation of an American Institution\n\nPeter Kastor, Professor of History and American Culture Studies at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\nBruce Ragsdale, renowned historian and winner of the 2022 George Washington Prize for his book, Washington at the Plow: The Founding Farmer and the Question of Slavery.\n\nPatrick Spero, Executive Director of the George Washington Presidential Library.\n\nFuture episodes will include Dr. Colin Calloway, Dartmouth Professor of History, Ramin Ganeshram, Executive Director of the Westport Museum, and others.\n\nEpisodes will be released biweekly and are available on Spotify, Apple, YouTube, and other podcast apps.

Social media platforms have transformed the political landscape by revolutionizing information dissemination, citizen engagement, and public opinion formation and change. Politicians use social media to communicate directly with voters in an unmediated and unfiltered manner. Comparatively, voters use social media to follow the latest messaging from politicians accompanied by demonstrating their support for particular politicians.\n\nThis book is a comprehensive examination of the role of digital and social media in the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Political discourse during the 2020 election revealed political disharmony and a deep political division among vast swaths of Americans that was powered, in part, by social media. This book reveals how digital and social media have reshaped power dynamics by altering the relationships among citizens, politicians, and traditional media outlets, the emergence of new influencers, and the impact of online activism on policy agendas.\n\nThis book, Social Media Politics, includes scholars with varied backgrounds and experience, using both quantitative and qualitative methodologies, from leading research institutions around the nation. Students, scholars, and practitioners will gain new knowledge to more clearly understand the role social media played in the 2020 presidential campaign.",

        "text": "Northwestern Mutual - Planning & Progress Study 2024\nFinancial States of America Americans have a rosier view of the direction of the U.S. economy, and yet, their feelings of financial insecurity have hit a record high. Just over half (54%) of U.S. adults expect the United States will enter a recession this year. While still a majority, it\u2019s a substantial drop from the two-thirds (67%) who predicted a recession last year. These more positive economic expectations are consistent across generations, with double-digit increases in optimism among Gen Z, Millennials, Gen X and Boomers+ alike. Expectations that the economy will enter into a recession this year Gen Z Millennials Gen X Boomers+ 2024 62% 59% 53% 48% 2023 74% 72% 70% 60% Difference 12% 13% 17% 12% At the same time, Americans\u2019 feelings of personal financial insecurity are on the rise. One-third (33%) of adults say they do not feel financially secure. This represents a jump from 27% who said the same last year and is the highest level of insecurity recorded in the study\u2019s history. The Northwestern Mutual Planning & Progress Study started in 2009, and began measuring financial security using its current methodology in 2012. Inflation is the clear driver underpinning that insecurity. Despite dropping substantially from its peak in 2022, inflation rates continue to weigh heavy on Americans\u2019 minds. More than half (54%) of U.S. adults expect inflation to increase this year, and only 9% say their household income is outpacing it. By far, inflation is considered the greatest obstacle to financial security, coming in well ahead of factors such as lack of savings and debt. Expectations for inflation in 2024 U.S. Adults Household income vs. inflation U.S. Adults Greatest obstacles to financial security U.S. Adults Increase 54% Growing slower 52% Inflation 51% Decrease 18% On pace 30% The economy 43% Stay the same 28% Growing faster 9% Lack of savings 31% Not sure 9% Personal debt 27% Healthcare costs 22% Government Dysfunction and the Presidential Election are Among People\u2019s Top Concerns for 2024 Beyond inflation, Americans are particularly worried about the impact that decisions \u2013 or indecision \u2013 by government officials could have on their financial well-being this year. When asked to rank the concerns that could impact their finances the most in 2024, \u201cinflation\u201d (57%) topped the list but \u201cgovernment dysfunction\u201d (34%) and \u201cthe U.S. Presidential Election\u201d (33%) ranked second and third, coming in ahead of longer-term worries such as \u201ca potential recession\u201d (24%), \u201cinterest rates\u201d (24%), \u201cmarket volatility\u201d (15%) and \u201cgeopolitical conflicts\u201d (14%). Playing Defense Given current market and economic conditions, 42% of U.S. adults feel 2024 is a year to prioritize \u201cplaying defense\u201d with their savings and investments (managing risk to protect their assets) vs. 29% who feel it\u2019s a year to be \u201cplaying offense\u201d (capitalizing on opportunities to grow their assets); and 29% are unsure. The gameplan for those who favor playing defense is mostly focused on cutting costs (56%) and building savings (51%). Younger generations score higher on adding a side hustle (46% for Gen Z and 43% for Millennials). About one in six Millennials (16%) said that they would get a financial advisor, while 15% said they would buy life insurance or increase life insurance coverage. Among high-net-worth individuals \u2013 people with more than $1 million in investable assets \u2013 higher numbers reported moving into safe, high-yielding instruments like money market funds (40%). The gameplan for those who favor playing offense is mostly focused on investing more in the stock market (42%), particularly for Gen Z (52%) and the high-net worth (50%). About half as many Americans indicated interest in investing more in real estate (21%), high-yield bonds (21%), alternative assets like hedge funds and private equity (19%), and speculative investments like cryptocurrencies (17%). Just 9% expect to invest more in gold or silver. Discipline in Decline Intentions don\u2019t always translate to action when it comes to financial planning. In fact, the research shows a continued decline among Americans who consider themselves \u201cdisciplined\u201d financial planners \u2013 from 65% in the post-Covid 2020 study to 45% in 2024. U.S Adults who consider themselves \u201cdisciplined\u201d financial planners 2020 65% 2021 60% 2022 59% 2023 50% 2024 45% People are Still Spending Despite high levels of financial insecurity, many Americans don\u2019t expect to largely pull back their spending on discretionary things like restaurants, vacations and entertainment in 2024. The research finds 59% of U.S. adults say they\u2019ll either spend the same or more on these purchases year-over-year, while just under four in 10 (37%) say they\u2019ll spend less. Among generations, Gen Z is the most likely to say they\u2019ll increase non-essential spending and Gen X is the most likely to say they\u2019ll be tightening their belts.

U.S. adults believe they will need $1.46 million to retire comfortably, a 15% increase over the $1.27 million reported last year, far outpacing today\u2019s inflation rate which currently hovers between 2% and 3%.

High-net-worth individuals \u2013 people with more than $1 million in investable assets \u2013 say they\u2019ll need nearly $4 million. 2024 All Gen Z Millennials Gen X Boomers+ HNW ($1M+) Amount expected to need to retire comfortably $1.46M $1.63M $1.65M $1.56M $990K $3.93M Meanwhile, the average amount that U.S. adults have saved for retirement dropped modestly from $89,300 in 2023 to $88,400 today, but is more than $10,000 off its five-year peak of $98,800 in 2021. 2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 Amount saved for retirement currently $88,400 $89,300 $86,900 $98,800 $87,500 Gap between retirement goal and current savings $1.37M $1.18M $1.16M $951K $864K Across all segments, there are large gaps between what people think they\u2019ll need to retire and what they\u2019ve saved to date. All Gen Z Millennials Gen X Boomers+ HNW ($1M+) Amount saved for retirement currently $88,400 $22,800 $62,600 $108,600 $120,300 $172,100 Gap between retirement goal and current savings $1.37M $1.61M $1.59M $1.45M $870K $3.76M Gen Z: Starting sooner with the aim of ending earlier The average age that Americans say they started saving for retirement is 31. But for Gen Z, it\u2019s 22 \u2013 nearly a decade earlier. It\u2019s also a full 15 years before Boomers+ who say they started when they were 37. Millennials and Gen X\u2019ers began saving for retirement at ages 27 and 31, respectively. The hope among Gen Z is that by starting to save sooner, they\u2019ll be able to retire earlier. They expect to retire at the age of 60, a dozen years before Boomers+ who say they\u2019ll work until they\u2019re 72. Millennials and Gen X\u2019ers expect to work until 64 and 67, respectively. The average age most people expect to work to is 65. The research discovered that three in 10 Millennials and Gen Z Americans believe it\u2019s likely or highly likely that they will live to age 100. The sentiment among these younger generations is stronger than older generations. Among Gen X and Boomers+, just 22% and 21% respectively agreed that they believed they would live to 100. The \u2018Silver Tsunami\u2019 is here In 2024, more than four million Americans will turn 65. That\u2019s an average of 11,000 Americans per day, and it will continue through 2027. It\u2019s the largest surge of Americans hitting the traditional retirement age in history. The 2024 Planning & Progress Study found that among generations closest to retirement, just half of Boomers+ (49%) and Gen X (48%) believe they will be financially prepared when the time comes. On average, Gen X believes there is a 42% chance they could outlive their savings, while Boomers+ put the probability at 37%. Across both generations, more than a third (37% and 38%, respectively) have not taken any steps to address the possibility of outliving their savings. When digging into some of the most pressing challenges associated with retirement planning, the research shows that Boomers+ and Gen X don\u2019t have markedly strong confidence in their preparedness. Boomers+ Gen X I know how much money I will need to retire comfortably 49% 40% I have a plan to address healthcare costs in retirement 56% 44% I have planned for the possibility that I could outlive my savings 37% 35% I have a plan to address long-term care needs in retirement 41% 34% I have planned for the potential that Social Security may or may not be in place when I qualify for it 39% 42% I will have enough to leave behind an inheritance or gift to loved ones and/or charitable causes I care about 50% 36% I have a good understanding of how taxes could impact my retirement and have factored that into my financial plans 58% 46% I have a good understanding of how potential drops in the stock market could impact my retirement and have factored that into my financial plans 58% 51% Taxes are an afterthought Only three in 10 (30%) Americans have a plan to minimize the taxes they pay on their retirement savings. Among them, the top 10 strategies employed include: Making withdrawals strategically from traditional and Roth accounts to remain in a lower tax bracket (32%) Using a mix of traditional and Roth retirement accounts (30%) Making strategic charitable donations (24%) Using a Health Savings Account (HSA) or other tax-advantaged healthcare account (23%) Using products like permanent life insurance or annuities for the tax benefits (22%) Making Roth conversions prior to taking RMDs or Social Security (19%) Using qualified charitable distributions from an IRA (17%) Making contributions to other tax-advantaged accounts like a 529 (14%) Using the basis paid into the cash value of permanent life insurance to remain in a lower tax bracket (13%) Taking advantage of a Qualified Longevity Annuity Contract (QLAC) to set aside funds for later in retirement (13%) In forthcoming data sets, the 2024 Planning & Progress Study will explore wide-ranging issues facing Americans spanning savings and debt, retirement income, emerging technology, professional help and more.

While about one in three (36%) say they will pay for the full cost, two in three (64%) expect their child to pay something. These are among the latest findings from Northwestern Mutual\u2019s 2024 Planning & Progress Study. About a third of parents saving for their kids\u2019 educational expenses (37%) anticipate that child\u2019s contribution to be between 1-25%. Meanwhile, a fifth (22%) anticipate it to be between 25-50%. Parents saving for college for their children say they expect their kids to contribute the following: Nothing (parents will have full responsibility) 36% Up to a quarter 37% Between a quarter and half 22% More than half 5% According to the Northwestern Mutual research, two in ten adults in America (led by 40% of Gen Z) are saving for college, either for themselves or a family member. On average, they expect the total cost of college to be $77,300 and aim to pay it off by the age of 45. Each American\u2019s actual college expenses may vary significantly, based on the type of school, the level of the institution, and the student\u2019s living arrangements. Among those who are saving for college for either themselves or an immediate family member, 23% are still paying off their own student debt. Americans\u2019 debt levels are growing. In 2024, Americans\u2019 personal debt, exclusive of mortgages, ticked up slightly between 2023 and 2024. The study revealed that two-thirds (66%) of Americans currently hold at least some personal debt, and the average amount people owe is $22,713. Americans' Personal Debt, Exclusive of Mortgages 2024 $22,713 2023 $21,800 2022 $22,354 2021 $23,325 2020 $26,621 2019 $29,803 The primary source of debt is credit cards, which account for more than double the #2 source (car loans) and more than triple the #3 source (education). What is Your Main Source of Debt? Please Select One. All Gen Z Millennials Gen X Boomers+ Credit card bills 28% 21% 30% 30% 29% Car loan 13% 10% 13% 15% 13% Personal education loans 8% 17% 11% 6% 2% Medical debt 7% 8% 9% 9% 5% Educational expenses for children/family 5% 7% 6% 5% 2% Caring for loved ones 3% 6% 4% 2% 1% I have no debt 34% 31% 25% 31% 46% Gen X and Millennials carry the most total personal debt. In both age groups, more than four in ten \u2013 42% of Gen X\u2019ers and 43% of Millennials \u2013 say their personal debt is at or near its highest level ever. All Gen Z Millennials Gen X Boomers+ Average debt, exclusive of mortgages $22,713 $16,478 $24,833 $28,670 $18,272 Meanwhile, only six in ten Millennials (59%) and Gen X\u2019ers (57%) say that they have a specific plan in place to pay down their debts. For people who carry personal debt, an average of 29% of their monthly income goes toward paying it off. That\u2019s a sizable chunk off the bottom line and may explain why people are increasingly prioritizing paying down debt before building savings. Lenders generally prefer that a person\u2019s debt-to-income ratio (DTI) is below 43 percent \u2013 although some want it to be no higher than 31 percent. The urgency to pay down debt is growing. But action to get it under control is lacking. The Northwestern Mutual study found that 64% of adults say they prioritize paying down debt versus 36% who put saving first. That continues a two-year trend which has seen a growing urgency to focus on debt first. At the same time, the number of people who report having specific plans to pay off their debt has dropped over the same period, from 64% in 2022 to 59% today. Which Do You Prioritize? 2022 2023 2024 Saving Money 43% 39% 36% Paying Down Debt 57% 61% 64% Do You Have a Specific Plan In Place to Pay Off Debt? 2022 2023 2024 Yes 64% 61% 59% No 36% 39% 41% Interestingly, the study found that saving is more of a priority for younger adults whereas paying down debt becomes more of a priority as people age. Which Do You Prioritize More? All Gen Z Millennials Gen X Boomers+ Saving money 36% 48% 42% 35% 25% Paying down debt 64% 52% 58% 65% 75% The survey also showed that striking a balance between spending and saving is getting murkier for many Americans. The number of U.S. adults who lack clarity on how much they can afford to spend now vs. how much to save for later has risen from a quarter (26%) in 2021 to a third (34%) today \u2013 reiterating the importance of a comprehensive financial plan. Do You Have Clarity on Exactly How Much You Can Afford to Spend Now Vs. How Much You Should Be Saving for Later? 2021 2022 2023 2024 Yes 74% 71% 70% 66% No 26% 29% 30% 34% Emergency funds can provide a safety net \u2013 for some. Six in ten (60%) Americans say they have an emergency fund \u2013 cash or other liquid assets independent of money earmarked for specific goals such as retirement funds in a 401k or IRA. That means four in ten Americans (40%) do not have any emergency savings. Among those who do have emergency funds, the average amount they have saved is $25,500. Only half (53%) say their savings would be enough to cover more than six months of expenses. In forthcoming data sets, the 2024 Planning & Progress Study will explore wide-ranging issues facing Americans spanning retirement income, emerging technology, professional help, generational planning and more.

More than half of Gen Z\u2019ers (57%) and Millennials (55%) say they are excited about the impact AI and generative AI (GenAI) tools could have on their financial lives. Meanwhile, older Americans are more skeptical \u2013 only 38% of Gen X\u2019ers and 23% of Boomers+ say they are excited. These are the latest findings from Northwestern Mutual\u2019s 2024 Planning & Progress Study and the first-ever research findings on AI in the study\u2019s history. According to the survey results, 63% of Gen Z and 57% of Millennials say AI will \u201cimprove the customer experience in the financial sector, including with financial planning.\u201d Conversely, less than half of Gen X (44%) and Boomers+ (32%) share this sentiment. AI will improve the customer experience in the financial services sector, including with financial planning. All Gen Z Millennials Gen X Boomers+ Yes 47% 63% 57% 44% 32% No 53% 37% 43% 56% 68% I\u2019m excited about the potential of AI/GenAI in the financial services industry. All Gen Z Millennials Gen X Boomers+ Yes 41% 57% 55% 38% 23% No 59% 43% 45% 62% 77% When asked to identify the potential benefit of AI Americans\u2019 are most excited about when it comes to managing their money, \u201cadvanced data analysis\u201d emerged as the top choice. Faster response times, increased efficiencies, improved customer service and greater opportunities for customization rounded out the remainder of the top five benefits. \u201cYounger generations are more willing to accept having their financial services partners leverage GenAI to manage their money,\u201d said Christian Mitchell, executive vice president and chief customer officer at Northwestern Mutual. \u201cHowever, even older generations say they are comfortable with their financial advisor leveraging the technology to ask even better questions and help them build wealth and financial security. The majority believe AI and GenAI can be a fantastic addition for a trusted advisor, helping financial professionals deliver even better results and experiences for their clients. The bottom line is this: artificial intelligence can help organizations find human capacity, not replace it.\u201d The future is human + digital In a pure side-by-side comparison, the research shows that people trust humans (54%) far more than AI alone (15%) across most core elements of financial planning, from creating a retirement plan to asking a financial question to managing budgets. Who do you trust more in the following scenarios? Not sure Both the same Artificial Intelligence (AI) more Humans more Creating a retirement plan 10% 19% 12% 59% Asking a financial question 8% 20% 13% 59% Developing a tailored, robust financial plan 11% 18% 15% 56% Creating a savings plan 9% 21% 14% 55% Making asset allocation decisions, building and managing investment portfolios 13% 20% 14% 53% Recommending financial products 11% 21% 15% 53% Providing financial savings tips 10% 23% 15% 52% Making updates to your personal customer information 10% 21% 16% 52% Managing a budget and keeping me on track 10% 23% 18% 49% AVERAGE: 10% 21% 15% 54% At the same time, the survey shows that people are largely comfortable with financial advisors and providers using AI tools for common tasks like fraud detection, answering service calls and joining meetings, and capturing notes, to more sophisticated tasks like predicting financial trends and modeling financial planning scenarios. What is your comfort level with financial advisors using AI to\u2026 Very uncomfortable Somewhat uncomfortable Somewhat comfortable Very comfortable Total Comfortable Detect fraud 15% 16% 38% 31% 69% Analyze data to predict future trends that could inform decision-making 16% 20% 41% 23% 64% Model and illustrate multiple financial scenarios to better visualize possible outcomes 16% 20% 43% 21% 64% Analyze data related to your financial habits, preferences, decisions and behaviors to identify areas for adjustments / improvements 17% 22% 41% 21% 62% Provide real-time financial guidance 18% 25% 39% 18% 57% Join meetings with you and be responsible for capturing information and prompting next steps 20% 28% 37% 16% 53% What is your comfort level with financial service firms using AI to\u2026 Very uncomfortable Somewhat uncomfortable Somewhat comfortable Very comfortable Total Comfortable Answer a straightforward financial question 18% 20% 39% 22% 61% Make updates to your basic customer data 19% 23% 37% 21% 58% Answer service calls and respond to your questions 21% 26% 36% 18% 54% Make updates to your existing financial plan 22% 28% 34% 17% 51% \u201cIt\u2019s still very early in terms of how far the technology will go, but AI tools are going to allow for the mass automation of tasks, significantly reducing manual work and deeply improving efficiencies across not just financial services, but most industries,\u201d said Mitchell. \u201cBy alleviating the most tedious and administrative aspects of our work, it will free up precious time to focus on building human connections and deliverables that provide the greatest value. So, it is people who sit at the heart of this digital transformation. The expertise and personalization that financial advisors provide can\u2019t be replicated or replaced by AI, but it can be enhanced. That\u2019s why we believe the future is human + digital.\u201d People aren\u2019t ready to replace humans with AI yet\u2026 but signs of cautious trust are there. The study also explored people\u2019s comfort level with AI in a few areas outside of financial planning. While very few are ready to replace humans with AI right away, trust levels in the emerging technology were higher than one might expect. For example, 40% of Americans are either somewhat or very trusting of AI taking over for human umpires and referees in professional sports; 35% say the same about AI taking over for nurses when collecting information such as medical histories and current symptoms during doctor\u2019s visits; a third (33%) say the same about AI taking over from artists to produce movies, books, music and paintings; and nearly a third (32%) say the same about AI taking over for educators to teach core curriculum classes.

Read the news release Read the 2024 Planning & Progress Study \u2013 Artificial Intelligence (AI) & Money\n\nValue of an Advisor Americans who work with a financial advisor expect to retire two years earlier and feel significantly more confident about their financial preparedness for the future. The impact of financial advice from an expert advisor is evident even among wealthy Americans \u2013 and it\u2019s especially apparent among Black and African Americans. Americans with an advisor expect to retire at age 64, two years sooner than Americans who don\u2019t work with an advisor (66). They also have saved twice as much money for retirement than those who do not have an advisor: $132,000 vs. just $62,000. Beyond the balance sheet, Americans with a financial advisor also feel more certain about their ability to reach their financial goals, and more bullish \u2013 believing that they reach their goals faster. Three in four Americans with an advisor (75%) believe that they will be financially prepared to retire, compared to just 45% without an advisor who feel the same. Nearly two in three Americans with an advisor (62%) say they know how much they need to save in order to retire comfortably, while about one in three without an advisor (34%) agree. Moreover, Americans with an advisor predict that they will pay off their student loan debt three years sooner: at age 43 instead of age 46. The emotional lift that expert advice can create is also visible among Americans\u2019 financial planning attitudes and beliefs. Behaviors and beliefs among all Americans With an advisor Without an advisor Have a long-term plan that factors for up-and-down economic cycles over time 79% 38% Have an emergency fund 84% 48% Feel financially secure 64% 29% Have good clarity on how much they can afford now vs. save for later 79% 60% Have taken a step to address possibility of outliving life savings 83% 53% Have a specific plan to pay off debt 79% 49% Have inflation factored into financial plan 69% 48% Have plan to address health care costs in retirement 69% 38% Will have enough to leave behind an inheritance or charitable gift 64% 33% American millionaires with an advisor feel more financially secure Among Americans with at least $1 million in investable assets, there\u2019s a big difference in behaviors and beliefs between people with an advisor and others who haven\u2019t sought out expert advice. These high-net-worth Americans with an advisor expect to retire a year sooner (61 vs. 62), and are more likely to believe they will be financially prepared for retirement than millionaires who lack an advisor (92% vs. 77%, a 15 percentage point difference). The study also found several other notable differences: Behaviors and beliefs among American millionaires With an advisor Without an advisor I have a will 81% 50% I have a specific plan in place to pay off debt, exclusive of mortgages 89% 67% I have a long-term financial plan that factors for up and down economic cycles 89% 75% Average age to seek financial advice is age 38, but for Millennials, it\u2019s 29 Among people who have a financial advisor, the average age this relationship began is 38. Interestingly, younger generations are engaging experts for financial advice earlier and earlier. The average Millennial with an advisor says they sought formal financial guidance at age 29 \u2013 nine years sooner than Gen X (age 38) \u2013 and a full 20 years before Boomers+ (age 49). Interestingly, 29 is also the average age when Americans get married, while the median age when a mother has her first child is age 30. Advisors are Americans\u2019 most trusted source for financial advice Once again, people across the U.S. say they trust financial advisors more than any other source for financial advice. More than twice as many Americans chose financial advisors (33%) over family members (16%), who ranked second. Interestingly, financial advisors were selected eight times more than online financial influencers and social media sites like Reddit and TikTok (4%). Gen Z was the only generation to perceive family members as the most trusted source of financial advice, followed closely by financial advisors. All Gen Z Millennials Gen X Boomers+ Financial advisor 33% 27% 28% 34% 39% Family member 16% 29% 17% 14% 9% Spouse/partner 12% 9% 16% 12% 10% Business news 5% 5% 5% 6% 6% Friend 4% 5% 6% 3% 3% Online financial influencers and social media sites (e.g., Reddit, TikTok) 4% 6% 6% 3% 0% Trade associations (e.g. AARP) 2% 2% 3% 2% 1% Local news 2% 2% 2% 2% 1% I have not received financial advice from anyone 22% 14% 17% 23% 29% Nearly three in ten are seeking an advisor now Northwestern Mutual\u2019s study found that seven in 10 Americans believe their financial planning needs improvement \u2013 and many are taking action. Nearly three in ten Americans (29%) who did not have an advisor before say they plan to start working with one \u2013 or have just recently started working with one. Black individuals with an advisor see significant gains in financial and emotional outcomes While the research shows financial advice can be impactful for all Americans, among Black and African American individuals, the influence is even more pronounced. Northwestern Mutual\u2019s study found that Black individuals with an advisor expect to retire three years sooner (age 61 vs. 64). They also have almost three times more in retirement savings on average than Black consumers who do not have a financial advisor ($71,000 vs. $26,000). They also expect to pay off their college debt five years earlier (by age 41 vs. 46). The study also found several other notable differences: Behaviors and beliefs among Black / African Americans With an advisor Without an advisor Have a long-term plan that factors for up-and-down economic cycles over time 72% 33% Have an emergency fund 76% 36% Feel financially secure 65% 26% Have good clarity on how much they can afford now vs. save for later 83% 58% Think they will be financially prepared for retirement 82% 50% Have taken a step to address possibility of outliving life savings 86% 53% Have a specific plan to pay off debt 77% 46% Have inflation factored into financial plan 73% 46% Have plan to address health care costs in retirement 72% 42% Will have enough to leave behind an inheritance or charitable gift 75% 39% All investments carry some level of risk, including loss of principal invested. No investment strategy can assure a profit and does not protect against loss in declining markets.

Just 26% of Americans expect to leave behind an inheritance. Do you expect to leave an inheritance (or give a gift / donation to a charitable organization?

One-third (32%) of Millennials expect to receive an inheritance (not counting the 3% who say they already have). But only 22% each of Gen X and Boomers+ say they plan to leave a financial gift behind. For Gen Z, the gap is even wider \u2013 nearly four in ten (38%) expect to receive an inheritance (not counting the 6% who say they already have). But only 22% of Gen X and 28% of Millennials say they plan to leave a financial gift behind. Based on plans alone, the generation that may see a larger wealth inheritance is Generation Alpha, given that more than a third (36%) of Gen Z say they plan to leave a financial gift behind. Do you expect to receive money / assets as part of an inheritance(s)? All Gen Z Millennials Gen X Boomers+ Yes 25% 38% 32% 28% 11% I already have and don\u2019t expect any more 10% 6% 3% 8% 22% No 53% 38% 49% 54% 62% Not sure 12% 18% 17% 10% 5% Among those expecting to receive an inheritance, half (50%) consider it \u201chighly critical\u201d or \u201ccritical\u201d to their long-term financial security.

Rather than feeling rich, American millionaires \u2013 those with at least $1 million in investable assets \u2013 are far more likely to exhibit feelings of financial clarity and preparedness than the general population. HNW Individuals ($1M+ in Investable Assets) General Public I have good clarity on exactly how much I can spend now vs save for later 87% 66% I know how much money I will need to retire comfortably 77% 44% I expect to be financially prepared for retirement when it comes 87% 54% I have a long-term financial plan that factors for up and down economic cycles over time 84% 52% I consider myself a disciplined financial planner 78% 45% In addition, millionaires are much more likely to work with a financial advisor (69%), more than double the amount of the general population (33%).

Moreover, 78% of millionaires describe themselves as \u201cdisciplined financial planners,\u201d while just 45% of the general population agrees. American millionaires are also more focused on creating inter-generational wealth than the general population, according to the research. HNW Individuals ($1M+ in Investable Assets) General Public I have a will 71% 38% I have taken steps to address the possibility of outliving my savings 84% 62% I have had a conversation with family about my inheritance plans 67% 55% Wealthy Americans trust financial advisors most, by far American millionaires put a high level of trust in financial advisors, far more than any other source.

Accordingly, six in ten (61%) millionaires say they have a plan to reduce the taxes they will owe on their retirement savings.

Meanwhile, the average retirement savings goal among Boomer+ women is seven-figures smaller: $902,000. But arguably, the largest generational difference between women is one rooted in attitudes and beliefs: six in 10 (60%) Gen Z women think they will be financially prepared to retire when the time comes, while just 40% of Gen X women agree. In a specific dollar amount, how much do you think you will need to save in order to retire comfortably? Women (average) Gen Z Women Millennial Women Gen X Women Boomers+ Women $1.5 million $1.2 million $1.5 million $2.1 million $902K Gen X women report being furthest away from their retirement goals, having $95,000 on average saved for retirement. Women (Average) Gen Z Women Millennial Women Gen X Women Boomers+ Women Amount saved for retirement currently $80K $16K $60K $95K $101K Gap between retirement goal and current savings $1.4M $1.2M $1.4M $2.0M $801K Perhaps unsurprisingly, many Gen X women described themselves as financially insecure, with 42% saying they do not feel secure. Moreover, 10% of Gen X women say they are currently unemployed and unable to work due to an injury or an illness. Retirement uncertainty and insecurity Only one-third (36%) of women indicate they know how much money they will need to retire comfortably. And nearly one quarter (24%) say they have less than 1x their current annual income saved for retirement. Total Men Total Women Gen Z Women Millennial Women Gen X Women Boomer+ Women I know how much money I will need to retire comfortably. 52% 36% 29% 34% 35% 42% I have a plan to address healthcare costs in retirement. 55% 42% 37% 41% 36% 50% I will have enough to leave behind an inheritance or gift to loved ones and/or charitable causes I care about. 49% 38% 41% 35% 34% 43% I have a plan to address long-term care needs in retirement. 45% 35% 34% 37% 30% 36% I have planned for the possibility that I could outlive my savings. 48% 31% 33% 35% 26% 30% Generation Zeal steps forward with confidence Generation Z women say they aim to retire nine years sooner than Boomer+ women (by age 62 vs. 71). They also expect to pay off their college loans a full decade earlier than their Millennial counterparts (by age 33 vs. 43). These feelings of confidence also extend to their retirement planning: six in 10 (60%) Gen Z women think they will be financially prepared to retire when the time comes, while just 40% of Gen X women agree. Younger women are also more likely than women in other generations to report that their household income is growing faster than or keeping pace with inflation. Is your household income growing faster, slower or is it on pace with inflation? Women (Average) Gen Z Women Millennial Women Gen X Women Boomers+ Women Faster or on pace 36% 40% 39% 33% 33% Slower 54% 42% 51% 58% 58% Not sure 11% 18% 10% 9% 9% They\u2019re also some of the most confident consumers: 57% of Gen Z women say they will spend more or the same in 2024 while just 37% expect to spend less. Advice for the ages The study finds that younger women are more inclined than older women to put their trust in family members and spouses when it comes to getting financial advice. Among older adult women, their most trusted source of financial advice is definitively with advisors. That said, one quarter (26%) of women have not received advice from anyone, and for Boomer+ women the number is even higher \u2013 32%.

        "text": "Biden and Trump clinch 2024 presidential nominations, teeing up general election rematch\nPresident Biden and former President Donald Trump are barreling toward a November election rematch after their primary wins Tuesday night.\n\nCBS News estimates that Trump will be the presumptive 2024 Republican nominee after his win in Washington, amassing the 1,125 delegates needed to clinch the GOP nomination. He also won the day's Georgia and Mississippi primaries, CBS News projected.\n\nIn a video posted to social media by the Trump campaign, Trump called it a \"great day of victory,\" but said \"we're not going to take time to celebrate. We'll celebrate in eight months when the election is over.\"\n\nMr. Biden clinched the Democratic Party's nomination earlier Tuesday. He picked up wins in Washington, Georgia and Mississippi, CBS News projected.\n\nWith these wins, and the nominations settled, this will now be one of the longest general election campaigns in modern history. There are 238 days until Nov. 5, the day of the presidential election.\n\n\"Four years ago, I ran for president because I believed we were in a battle for the soul of this nation,\" Mr. Biden said in a statement released by his campaign Tuesday night. \"Because of the American people, we won that battle, and now I am honored that the broad coalition of voters representing the rich diversity of the Democratic Party across the country have put their faith in me once again to lead our party \u2014 and our country \u2014 in a moment when the threat Trump poses is greater than ever.\"\n\nTrump's path to the nomination\n\n\n\nIt's been an unconventional path to the nomination for Trump, who is the first former president in history to be indicted on criminal charges.\n\nTrump held a commanding lead in the polls over every primary challenger since launching his reelection campaign in November 2022. And those polls weren't even close: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis managed to come within a 15-point difference of Trump in a Fox News poll released in February 2023, long before DeSantis actually jumped into the race.\n\nThen Trump was indicted in four separate criminal proceedings \u2014 facing a total of 91 felony charges. With each indictment, Trump saw a boost in his primary poll numbers and was able to raise millions off of perceived efforts to unfairly target the former president.\n\nWith a larger war chest of cash and assertive lead in the polls, Trump was emboldened to ignore his primary rivals, declaring the primary over before it effectively started. He refused to participate in any of the debates sanctioned by the Republican National Committee or to sign a pledge to support the party's eventual nominee.\n\nTrump also rarely appeared on the campaign trail. The former president campaigned in Iowa only 26 times this cycle, compared to Gov. DeSantis who visited all 99 counties in the Hawkeye State.\n\nUltimately, Trump won the Iowa caucus by the largest margin of any Republican ever, crushing his rivals by winning 51% of Iowa caucus-goers.\n\nThe former president steamrolled through the early nominating contests, winning all but two of the primaries in his path. Former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, the last Republican to square off against Trump before dropping out the day after Super Tuesday, only won two GOP primaries, in Vermont and Washington, D.C.\n\nNow, Trump officially turns his focus to Mr. Biden, who defeated Trump in 2020 by flipping key battleground states Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Georgia and Arizona.\n\nPolling currently shows Trump leading Mr. Biden in a head-to-head matchup. A CBS News poll released earlier in March shows Trump with his largest lead yet, besting Mr. Biden 52% to 48% among likely voters.\n\nBiden's reelection campaign is underway\n\nClinching the Democratic nomination was more of a formality for Mr. Biden.\n\nThe incumbent president faced two longshot challengers in Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesota and author Marianne Williamson, but has overwhelmingly won every Democratic primary and caucus thus far (except for in American Samoa, where he split delegates with venture capitalist Jason Palmer, although Palmer won more of the 91 votes cast).\n\nA movement to vote \"uncommitted\" on some state ballots to protest Mr. Biden's response to the Israel-Hamas war has been the second top vote-getter in some states (Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, Hawaii), though with a wide gap between the president and this option.\n\nMr. Biden's path to 1,968 delegates also began with an adjusted calendar he pushed for in 2022 \u2013 with South Carolina taking the first slot followed by Nevada and Michigan.\n\nWith its \"first in the nation\" law, New Hampshire was technically the first state to hold a Democratic nominating contest. While the president's name was not on the ballot and no delegates were awarded, due to the state breaking the DNC's new rules, Mr. Biden won anyway with a write-in vote.\n\nFollowing his State of the Union address last Thursday, the president and his campaign have shifted into full general election mode.\n\nHe has ramped up his battleground state travel, with trips to Pennsylvania, Georgia, Wisconsin and Michigan slated so far this month. Vice President Kamala Harris was in Arizona and Nevada over the weekend.\n\nThe campaign announced a $30 million ad buy over the next six weeks, with the first ad looking to tackle concerns about the president's age, 81. The campaign has a goal of opening 100 new offices across the battleground states and adding 350 new staffers this month.\n\nUnderscoring the campaign's pivot to the general election mode is a severe cash advantage for Mr. Biden, with over $130 million cash on hand according to campaign finance records in combination with the DNC, nearly doubling Mr. Trump's war chest.\n\nBut the incumbent president is still stuck in a tight battle with his 2020 opponent according to national and battleground state polling \u2014 in part due to waning enthusiasm from his winning Democratic coalition in 2020.\n\nMr. Biden has already started putting his contrasts with Trump front and center in his campaign. He referred frequently to \"my predecessor\" in his State of the Union address and has continued his criticism of Trump on the campaign trail.\n\n\"Donald Trump has a different constituency. Here's the guy who's kicking off his general election campaign in the road up with Marjorie Taylor Greene. It can tell you a lot about a person who he keeps company with,\" Mr. Biden said during a campaign event in Atlanta on Saturday.",

        "text": "Political Violence in Mexico's 2024 Elections: Organized Crime Involvement\nDOWNLOAD THE ARTICLE HERE\n\nWhen it comes to an understanding of political violence in Mexico, there is a risk of solely equating it with criminal groups' activities or exclusively attributing it to such groups. However, the political violence phenomenon in Mexico is complex and diverse, with a particular nexus to locally based illicit economies, for which an all-containing approach is insufficient.\n\nAbout half of the political violence that occurred in Mexico during the 2018 elections was directly attributed to organized crime. During such time, political figures were killed at a rate of one per week.\n\nThese numbers support the growing concern about criminal groups' involvement in Mexican politics. Criminal groups have used political violence in several ways: directly manipulating and influencing elections, protecting incumbent candidates with whom they have struck an agreement, killing candidates who are perceived as a threat to their interests, intimidating poll workers, and attacking and stealing voting booths, among others.\n\nThe decrease in the profitability of trafficking heroin and cannabis, the legalization of marijuana in many US states, and increased fentanyl usage have forced cartels to recalibrate strategies and markets. Nowadays, criminal groups have partially shifted towards locally based illicit economies, such as oil theft, extortion, kidnapping, and other illegal activities that require control of local territories. All these variables come into play when understanding that criminalized electoral politics is a predominantly local phenomenon in Mexico.\n\nPolitical violence by criminal groups in Mexico is motivated by multiple factors, including economic interests, political objectives, and vendettas. Criminal organizations often avoid open confrontation when attacking politicians or political candidates, opting for other less visible techniques to minimize the impacts on police and law enforcement agencies, such as corruption.\n\nInstalling or co-opting candidates at the municipal level has afforded criminal groups direct influence over the actions of local and state police. Access to intelligence on pending arrests or other operations has also proven beneficial for criminal organizations. Political influence has allowed criminal groups to employ local security forces as appendages of their organizations to detain or kill targets and to protect the transportation of illicit goods. Moreover, criminal organizations have tapped into state finances by coopting government employees.\n\nCriminal groups demand that \u201cinvestments\u201d in electoral campaigns bestow advantages over competitors or, more clearly, demarcate lines of territorial control. Problems arise when their demands are unmet. There are \u201cparadise municipalities,\u201d which are pacts that work with almost no violence and resistance from the government. However, they are scarce. In some cases, state governors and local politicians prefer to \u201cdouble-sell the plaza\u201d to several competing criminal groups, perpetuating highly volatile state-criminal arrangements. It is widely known that many politicians' promises are never kept, which, in turn, sparks new waves of violence. In this scenario, criminal groups have turned to direct attacks on politicians, candidates, and police officers. Demonstrations such as burning vehicles and blocking roads or public messages and videos have been employed to inflict reputational damage by attracting harmful press coverage.\n\nTherefore, it is understood that access to the Mexican state is crucial for criminal groups\u2019 survival and expansion. It is generally accepted that only illegal groups with state protection grow. The need for such protection translates into criminal groups threatening competitors\u2019 allies and sabotaging possible arrangements with politicians. There is a particular inclination to do so around elections when new pacts are brokered. In this regard, cartels are forced to change the electoral balance to capture state agents and gain an advantage to control territories and markets.\n\nMexican politicians or political candidates are identified as rivals when they don't cooperate with organized criminal groups, which then are targeted by way of threats or, in extreme cases, murder. Murders have a particular effect since they send a potent message to political opponents and civil society. There have even been cases of local politicians being killed even hours or days after taking office. Another way, generally unidentified, of pressuring \u201cuncooperative\u201d politicians is through violence to instill fear among voters and in turn, affect voter turnout.\n\nAn additional concern is the rapidly increasing involvement of criminal groups in election finances through illicit campaign funding. In Mexico, campaign budgets come along with statutory caps, with an average amount from public and private sources of 333,921 pesos (about 16,650 USD) for municipalities in the 2021 election. Not surprisingly, local candidates view the budget amounts as insufficient, and accepting illegal funding sources from criminal groups hasn\u00b4t been uncommon; some campaigns have spent as much as 20 million pesos (500,000 USD).\n\nOn the other side, criminal organizations strike local authorities to obtain access to public funds, which they later use to strengthen their territorial presence. This phenomenon, known as the \u201crent capture strategy,\u201d only functions when the number of resources they can extract exceeds the costs of corrupting public authorities.\n\nWhen criminal organizations manage to capture local elections effectively, they reap multiple benefits, such as accessibility for transporting illegal drugs, fewer obstacles to money laundering, intelligence gathering, protection from the local police, non-interference in their activities, and even support from the police to combat rival groups. Electoral cycles stimulate violence because it is easier to capture candidates seeking power than sitting politicians who tend to have more extensive state protection.\n\nMexican cartels see local electoral cycles as an opportunity to attack vulnerable candidates to build subnational criminal governance control, later granting them decision-making influence. As elections threaten the relationships established with politicians and a change in the political status quo, criminal groups continually seek to protect existing political relationships and form new ones.\n\nElectoral local dynamics and the consequent risk for criminal groups\u00b4 intervention are not homogenous throughout Mexico\u00b4s 32 states. Integralia\u2019s risk assessment divides the risk of organized crime intervention in the 2024 local elections into six risk categories: Very High, High, Medium, Low, and Very Low. The states with the highest risk of intervention have i) accumulation of illicit markets, ii) criminal groups in armed conflict, iii) weak rule of law, iv) municipal elections, and v) municipalities considered important to criminal groups.\n\nImage Credit Integralia Consultores\n\nRegarding the influence of organized crime at the national level, while experts identify the Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generaci\u00f3n (CJNG) and the Sinaloa Cartel as the main actors with a presence in multiple states, crime dynamics vary by region.\n\nCriminal groups' involvement in politics risks further aggravating the dissimilarities and volatility of dangerous states, creating contrasting realities for Mexicans who are experiencing high levels of crime and violence and, in some cases, polarizing displacements due to criminal groups.\n\nThe influence of organized crime in Mexican politics poses an imminent and severe threat to the nation's democratic integrity and stability. The convergence of criminal groups with political structures jeopardizes the fundamental principles of governance, fostering an environment where criminal interests supersede the welfare of citizens. The intertwining of criminal groups and politics compromises the rule of law and undermines the credibility of democratic institutions. This perilous alliance amplifies corruption, perpetuates violence, and erodes public trust, hindering the country's potential for sustainable development.\n\nThe dangerous nexus between organized crime and politics demands decisive and vigilant counteraction to safeguard the citizens\u00b4 well-being, the democratic fabric of Mexico, and the already declining interest in defending such a system",

Here is a breakdown of the second high-profile case involving Trump at the Court this year.\n\nEarlier this month, the Supreme Court decided in Trump v. Anderson that Colorado could not block the former president from appearing on its primary ballot.\n\nThe immunity case in Donald J. Trump v. United States will center on one simple sentence: \u201cwhether and if so to what extent does a former President enjoy presidential immunity from criminal prosecution for conduct alleged to involve official acts during his tenure in office.\u201d\n\nAfter an appeals court decision gave Special Counsel Jack L. Smith the green light to initiate a conspiracy and obstruction trial against Trump, his attorneys sought a stay of that decision. (On Nov. 18, 2022, Attorney General Merrick B. Garland appointed Smith to serve as the Special Counsel in the case.)\n\nNCC Podcast: Is President Trump Immune From Prosecution?\n\nHere are the arguments made by both sides in presenting their cases to the justices. To be sure, a torrent of other briefs will arrive at the Court in the next month or so; briefs will be accepted at the Court until April 15, 2024. But both teams need to parse from that one sentence the key facts the justices will consider during arguments.\n\nThe case from Trump\u2019s team\n\nIn August 2023, a grand jury indicted Trump on four charges related to his actions after the 2020 presidential election. On Feb. 6, 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled that Smith could move forward with a trial.\n\n\u201cFor the purpose of this criminal case, former President Trump has become citizen Trump, with all of the defenses of any other criminal defendant. But any executive immunity that may have protected him while he served as President no longer protects him against this prosecution,\u201d concluded a unanimous three-judge District of Columbia Circuit appeals court panel.\n\nOn Feb. 12, the former president\u2019s attorneys sought a stay of the decision form the U.S. Supreme Court. Trump\u2019s stay petition asked the Court to consider if Trump had undertaken official acts \u201cperformed within the \u2018outer perimeter\u2019 of his official responsibility.\u201d The petition also argued that Trump already had been tried for the alleged Jan. 6 acts during his Senate impeachment proceedings, and he could not be tried a second time.\n\nOn Feb. 28, the Supreme Court granted a stay and limited the arguments in the case to the single issue of presidential immunity.\n\nTrump\u2019s team has asked the Supreme Court to look closely at the immunity question. \u201cThe panel opinion \u2026 like the district court, concludes that Presidential immunity from prosecution for official acts does not exist at all. This is a stunning breach of precedent and historical norms. In 234 years of American history, no President was ever prosecuted for his official acts. Nor should they be,\u201d they argued. Trump\u2019s attorneys also claim that grand jury indictment against Trump was based on \u201cfive types of conduct, all constituting official acts of the President.\u201d\n\nIn the stay petition, former President Trump pointed to Fitzgerald v. Nixon, a Supreme Court decision from 1982, as establishing presidential immunity precedents. Fitzgerald had been fired from a government position after testifying to Congress about Air Force cost overruns, and Fitzgerald later filed a civil lawsuit against former President Richard Nixon.\n\nIn his 5-4 majority opinion, Justice Lewis Powell said that Nixon, as \u201ca former President of the United States, is entitled to absolute immunity from damages liability predicated on his official acts.\u201d Powell also pointed to two cases, Barr v. Matteo (1959) and Stump v. Sparkman (1978) to determine that \u201cthe President\u2019s absolute immunity extends to all acts within the \u2018outer perimeter\u2019 of his duties of office.\u201d\n\nIn a reply brief, Trump\u2019s team also claimed that under Marbury v. Madison, all courts created under Article III of the Constitution lacked the power to consider a president\u2019s official discretionary acts.\n\nThe arguments from Special Counsel Smith\n\nThe United States and Special Counsel Smith rejected Trump\u2019s main arguments in its brief prior to the Court\u2019s stay decision.\n\nOn the issue of immunity based on the \u201couter perimeter\u201d of official presidential duties, Smith was blunt: \u201cThat position finds no support in constitutional text, separation-of-powers principles, history, or logic. And if that radical claim were accepted, it would upend understandings about Presidential accountability that have prevailed throughout history while undermining democracy and the rule of law.\u201d\n\nSmith stated the Fitzgerald precedent was narrow and applied to civil cases only. \u201cFitzgerald\u2019s concern that potential exposure to private civil damages actions would chill a President\u2019s decision-making, to the detriment of the vigorous exercise of executive authority, does not apply to the context of federal criminal prosecution.\u201d\n\nHe also quoted in part a dissent from Justice Clarence Thomas in Trump v. Vance (2020), a case where Trump objected to a subpoena for his financial records from the district attorney for the County of New York. \u201cThis Court has recognized absolute immunity for the President from \u2018damages liability predicated on his official acts,\u2019\u201d Thomas wrote. \u201cBut we have rejected absolute immunity from damages actions for a President\u2019s nonofficial conduct, Clinton v. Jones (1997).\u201d\n\nSmith also wrote that while \u201ccourts cannot enter an injunction against a sitting President directing his performance of official acts,\u201d such protection \u201cdoes not suggest that courts are disabled from holding a former President accountable when his actions violate federal criminal law.\u201d\n\nHe also disputed the Trump team\u2019s interpretation of Marbury v. Madison, pointing to \u201cthe long record of this Court\u2019s review of the lawfulness of Presidential acts,\u201d such as the Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer decision in 1952.\n\nSmith concluded that \u201cPresidents, like other citizens, must comply with federal criminal law. Nothing in the respect appropriately shown to a sitting President\u2019s discretionary official acts implies that a former President has immunity from all personal accountability for crimes committed through the exercise of official power.\u201d\n\nCourt briefs filed over the next month will focus on the questions of what constitutes an official act of a president; which acts are within the outer perimeter of a president\u2019s duties; and the liability of former presidents to criminal prosecution for conduct while in office.\n\nTrump v. United States will be heard on the last day of scheduled arguments this term, and the Court is expected to issue its final decisions for the current term in late June.\n\nScott Bomboy is the editor in chief of the National Constitution Center.",

        "text": "Russia claims US and 'Western countries' are trying to hack its presidential election\nAs Russia prepares for its presidential election this week, its systems are reportedly being targeted by \u201cmassive\u201d cyberattacks, according to local authorities.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin is running against three \u201cofficially permitted\u201d opponents in the election scheduled to take place from March 15 to 17. It will be Russia's first-ever three-day-long presidential election and the first instance when residents from certain regions, including Moscow, can cast their votes online.\n\nLast week, a Russian state official from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that hackers from \u201cWestern countries\u201d are plotting and already orchestrating cyberattacks on Russian election infrastructure.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good that our electoral system turned out to be resistant to external cyber influence, but this is also an indicator of how great the pressure of enemies is on the Russian state,\u201d said the ministry\u2019s ambassador-at-large Gennady Askaldovich.\n\nThe head of the Russian election commission, Ella Pamfilova, also stated last week that Russian \"enemies\" are attempting to meddle in the presidential elections in the country \"to such an extent as never before.\"\n\n\u201cThe Russian electoral system today is experiencing unprecedented attempts at interference; the hacker attacks are ongoing; the purpose of all this is to disrupt the presidential election,\u201d she added.\n\nPamfilova said that due to cyberattacks on the election commission\u2019s services and websites, electronic voting is allowed only in those regions where \"its security is guaranteed.\u201d\n\nNeither Askaldovich nor Pamfilova provided any evidence for alleged election-related cyberattacks. The Kremlin, which conducted an extensive interference operation targeting the 2016 U.S. presidential election, has a history of making baseless accusations to satisfy its own political goals.\n\nThe Russian National Computer Incident Coordination Center (CERT) has also issued a warning to online voters about the escalating cyber threats, including those that could originate from Ukraine and its allied countries. According to the CERT statement, cybercriminals will try to discredit the election, stir up social tension, spread fake news and infect online voters with malware.\n\nThe agency has advised its users to be cautious of phishing websites posing as electronic voting services. They also warned against emails and messages containing malicious links, disguised as official correspondence from Russian state agencies.\n\nThis week, Russia's foreign intelligence service specifically accused the U.S. of attempting to interfere in Russia's election and launching a cyberattack on its online voting system. The White House denied this statement.\n\n\u201cThese allegations are categorically false and nothing more than propaganda,\" a White House National Security Council spokesperson told Reuters. \"The U.S. has not and will not meddle in Russia\u2019s election. It is Russia that has a long history of targeting U.S. and other democratic elections.\u201d\n\nLast week, the Kremlin said that Russia will not meddle in the upcoming U.S. presidential election in November, and dismissed the findings that Moscow was behind the campaigns to interfere in both the 2016 and 2020 U.S. presidential elections.\n\nSo far, there have been no public cases of Russian state websites going down, and none of the prominent Ukrainian hacktivist groups have claimed responsibility for such attacks.\n\nOn Monday, the Russian independent media organization Meduza said that it has been targeted by an \u201cunprecedented\u201d cyber campaign ahead of the upcoming presidential election.\n\nLocal independent media are also warning of possible internet or social media outages during the election period. This is a common practice in authoritarian countries and was recently used during Pakistan\u2019s elections.\n\nThe reports of internet outages in Russia have become more frequent recently, with some appearing to be politically motivated.\n\nThe Kremlin is also trying to prevent its opponents from speaking up against Putin. For example, Russia banned the publication of polls, forecasts, and studies related to the presidential elections.\n\nSupporters of the killed opposition leader Alexey Navalny also reported receiving fake messages, stating that the protests they are planning to organize on election day have been postponed.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be fooled by fakes! They are trying to deceive you! Come to the polling stations on March 17 at 12:00 local time and vote against Putin,\u201d Navalny\u2019s team said.",

But this year a group of analysts surveyed by CFR have sounded the biggest alarm about something bubbling up at home - political violence around this year\u2019s presidential election. They have also flagged the prospects of a surge in migration at the southwest U.S. border as a leading concern. And while both are scenarios playing out, rather unusually, on U.S. soil, they have consequences for the rest of the world.\n\nTo help sort through these and other worries, we turn to Paul Stares. Paul is a CFR senior fellow and director of the Center for Preventive Action, which runs a yearly survey of global threats and priorities.\n\nI\u2019m Gabrielle Sierra and this is Why It Matters. Today, what to worry about in 2024.\n\nGabrielle SIERRA: So Paul, this isn\u2019t the first time that we\u2019ve had you on Why It Matters, you joined us last year to go over the top threats for 2023. But new year, new threats, so let\u2019s kick it off. What are the top concerns for 2024?\n\nPaul B. STARES: So In terms of the top priorities this year or risks, the first is the likelihood of growing political polarization in the United States, which leads to potential acts of domestic terrorism, political violence, particularly around the upcoming presidential election. The second concern was an expansion or escalation of the ongoing conflict in Gaza between Israel and Hamas. And the third ranked concern this year is the surge in immigration toward the southwest border of the United States. And some are already moving in the direction of what people were concerned or anticipated at the end of 2023.\n\nThese top priorities are all high impact, high probability contingencies - and having three of them on the report in one year is unprecedented. So let's go through them one at a time, beginning with domestic terrorism and political violence here in the United States.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/lfP_5L8epow?si=o1NE2ArcHY-bwVC-&t=37\n\nVICE News: Stop protecting tyrants\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0\n\nMSNBC: We turn now to the 2024 presidential race\n\nhttps://youtu.be/CrazBhHlFyM?si=NhoXSz7DZ58flIKH&t=244\n\nPBS NewsHour: You mention the issue of political violence, the language is careless.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/EN1TxijCEX0?si=2aVMt9Nug6-nc3pV&t=80\n\nTODAY: If you don\u2019t fight like hell, you\u2019re not going to have a country anymore.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/KCbTgDC14uY?si=8w-QjKu6GXcD1bGl&t=60\n\nThe Independent: I\u2019m telling you, if Pence caved, we\u2019re going to drag [expletive] through the streets. [expletive] politicians are going to get dragged through the streets.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/dIKg_rDBSYk?si=GI02MhtTmmV5yKwA\n\nTimes Radio: You know the risk of something much much worse than January the 6 I think is quite high.\n\nSIERRA: Yikes.\n\nSTARES: Yikes, indeed. So this is the first year that we have included a domestic conflict related contingency. Prior years we've only ever included foreign threats or overseas or foreign-sourced concerns. But when we did the solicitation of what to include, it was the overwhelming top concern in this year's preventive priorities survey.\n\nSIERRA: I mean it must have been really top of mind if domestic issues rarely make the list.\n\nSTARES: I think just the level of polarization over the last four or five years has definitely increased in the United States. Obviously January 6th is in people's minds, the storming of the Capitol in 2020. And a lot of people worry about how this growing polarization could really lead to acts of political violence. And here I'm talking about potential assassination of candidates, possible terrorist acts at the conventions, disruption of the voting procedures, possibly again a sort of January 6th-like disruption of the counting and then the actual outcome being properly accredited at the end of this whole process. So this could go on throughout essentially 2024, well into 2025.\n\nSIERRA: So what can we do about it?\n\nSTARES: We could try to reduce the risk of candidates, if not deliberately then inadvertently, inciting their supporters to engage in violence. We can take extra security precautions around known events, the primaries obviously, and beef up the security for the candidates, beef up the security around events like the conventions, polling stations and so on.\n\nSIERRA: We see how big of a deal this is for us, but a domestic issue is at home, so why should anyone outside of the U.S. even care about this?\n\nSTARES: I think it's worth taking a time out just to think about what are the foreign policy implications of growing political violence or polarization in the U.S.? And I think you can imagine there are several concerns in the minds of foreign policy experts. Obviously they're concerned about the threat to life and liberty at home, but I think they're probably also worried that foreign actors, foreign adversaries could try to foment more divisions, more divisiveness within the U.S. and through disinformation, social media, fake news, they could sort of whip up even further unrest and potential violence in the U.S. I think another concern is that if this were to happen, the U.S. could be just distracted by this. And other actors might take advantage who see the U.S. just got their hands full at home, and so they do things abroad again against U.S. interests. Another probable concern is for many years, the U.S. has been a big promoter of democracy and human rights around the world. We've advocated for peaceful elections and the orderly transfer of power, and it's going to be damn hard for the U.S. to advocate for all those things if we essentially can't keep the peace at home. And so as I've argued in many respects, conflict prevention is now going to have to begin at home if we want to try to be effective abroad.\n\nSIERRA: Yeah. Like how can we set an example, how could we tell people how to run their country -\n\nSTARES: Precisely. We've been doing this for years. We've encouraged international organizations to develop handbooks to manage elections, and when we can't sort of do it in a peaceful, orderly process, it really undercuts the credibility of the message, frankly.\n\nSidenote, if you are interested in diving further into how we got into this phase in the first place, there is a great book out by two of my CFR colleagues, Jacob Ware and Bruce Hoffman. It\u2019s called God, Guns, and Sedition: Far Right Terrorism in America. Yes the title promises a lot and the book delivers. You should check it out.\n\nSIERRA: I get that this is very very scary and it\u2019s something we need to prevent, but I do still wonder how foreign policy experts compared something like this to the great power threats on the list?\n\nSTARES: It's really hard. Obviously, I don't think one can compare acts of terrorism at home, certainly if it's relatively low level or random, and it's contained afterwards with the possibility of escalation between the U.S. and China over Taiwan, which could conceivably lead to major power conflict and even the use of nuclear weapons. They're two quite different possibilities. But for the U.S. to be distracted at this time for there to be major sort of violent divisions within the U.S., this could kind of resonate in extremely unwelcome ways around the world. So I don't want to underestimate or underrate the risk that comes from domestic terrorism and political violence in the U.S. because it really is a serious threat.\n\nAnd so foreign policy experts think one of the biggest threats in the year ahead is actually at home.\n\nLet\u2019s move on to the next of the top three threats, the escalation of war in the Middle East.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fg_pPmNrVYU\n\nPBS NewsHour: The U.S. priority since the October 7 Hamas terrorist attack has been preventing violence from expanding across the region.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0\n\nCNN: New strikes on Iranian backed militants far from Israel's borders, stoking fears that the United States is on the brink of a wider war in the Middle East.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cXvgmzc88s\n\nWGN News: President Biden is vowing to respond after an Iranian-backed drone strike.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/_cXvgmzc88s?si=RdqZUThkH5t5UyLr&t=29\n\nWGN News: Three American troops killed and at least thirty-four more injured today.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/i9mWAshwvSE?si=Us8r-qDh8EZhkB67&t=155\n\nTODAY: Today in this region, U.S. allies from Bahrain to Egypt are warning of further instability while condemning what they're calling a terrorist attack.\n\nSIERRA: Can you explain a bit more about this idea of wider regional conflict?\n\nSTARES: Yeah, so when the survey was sent out back in November, the war between Israel and Hamas was pretty much contained to Gaza. And since late November of 2023, we've seen there's definitely been an escalation, most notably by the Houthis in Yemen attacking ships in international waters, the U.S. countering that with multiple rounds of strikes against the Houthis. The Houthis have long-range missiles that cannot only attack shipping but could even potentially reach Israel, I believe. And I think there was a case early in the conflict in which one such missile was intercepted by Israel. So there's that dimension. There is the possibility of Hezbollah, which is an Islamist militant group backed by Iran, conducting attacks across the border from Lebanon into Israel and Israel striking back. And we've seen since November, that has started to occur and there's been an uptick in violence there. We've also seen Israeli forces attacking targets in Syria, which are believed to be against Iran-backed militant groups there. There's been no direct attack on Iran so much, but we've seen Iran striking what they think are Israeli targets in northern Iraq. We've seen an uptick in Iranian-backed militants attacking U.S. forces in Syria and Iraq and the U.S. retaliating. And perhaps most surprising of all, we saw Iran striking targets in Pakistan and Pakistan striking back against targets in Iran. And so any one of these four or five, if you will, vectors or trajectories of potential escalation could definitely get worse in the coming months. And it's not hard to see how what was previously a relatively contained conflict becomes a much wider regional conflagration.\n\nSIERRA: The PPS report lists threats in relation to the United States. The Middle East is about 7,000 miles away, right. But sometimes what happens there hits close to home. In January, an Iran-backed group killed three Americans at a military base in Jordan. So, in what other ways might this directly affect the United States?\n\nSTARES: In several ways. One is it's distracted the U.S. in its support for Ukraine against Russia. There's not only the attention that policymakers can give to countries that are under attack, but the level of support: military, diplomatic is also affected. And I think the U.S. has become increasingly distracted by trying to tamp down the possibility of escalation. They've deployed carrier battle groups to the Eastern Mediterranean. As I say, they've already ramped up some strikes against threats to their forces in Syria and Iraq. So it's a big distraction there. There's always the possibility that the war will resonate domestically. We've seen some extent in terms of level of protests in the U.S. against Israeli actions in Gaza, and that's a source of concern and can become a kind of issue in the presidential campaign. It's a source of tension with allies too. Several U.S. allies have been quite critical of Israeli actions in Gaza. And so that becomes a tension there. Again an unwelcome development at this time.\n\nSIERRA: What steps could help avoid the worst outcomes for an escalating Israeli-Palestinian conflict?\n\nSTARES: Well, definitely you have to think about this in all its dimensions. There's obviously the efforts to try to deter further escalation militarily by either the Houthis, and we're seeing that trying to degrade the Houthis capacity to attack shipping. We've seen U.S. military force being used as a warning to Iran to again try to control their proxy forces in Lebanon and Iraq. So there's the military dimension. There's the diplomatic angle too, and you've seen U.S. officials going to the region on a regular basis trying to broker a ceasefire in Gaza, engaging with Gulf countries and Egypt to try to sort of bring the fighting to an end, to see the hostages released from Hamas. And you've seen efforts also to try to stabilize international markets so they're not roiled in a really destabilizing way by the conflict there. So there are multiple ways we can try to contain this, to deescalate, look for off ramps, try to encourage some of the key countries involved here to show restraint and look for a diplomatic solution rather than escalate in a really harmful way.\n\nMoving on to big threat number three and bringing it back home: a migration crisis on the southwest U.S. border.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/-LjY1nE_cCA?si=MomNW1gGyvD0tXUw&t=1\n\nTODAY: The crisis at the border? Unrelenting with thousands arriving daily from California to Arizona and Texas.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/yZAH4uIXLp8?si=49v6DzP-3X1uLcYn&t=15\n\nNBC News: Tonight, customs and border protection overwhelmed by an unprecedented number of migrants crossing the southern border.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/QGvsJ5w7vzo?si=mad9u03tLr1F-j-D&t=27\n\nFOX 26 Houston: Many lawmakers are now calling it a war against fentanyl, and they believe it starts right here at the border impacting families hundreds of miles away.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/DdlipIbsq4A?si=Mv83wehibdzOJtp5&t=2\n\nABC News: President Biden and Donald Trump both there late today, just demonstrating how significant this issue is with the presidential election this November.\n\nSTARES: Throughout 2023, we saw a substantial increase in the number of migrants reaching the southern border of the U.S. Reports that as many as 2.3-2.4 million migrants arrived in the U.S. in an unregulated fashion in 2023. The end of the year, something like 10,000 were crossing the border every day. It's an extraordinary number. They were coming from a lot of different places: obviously Central America and Mexico. A lot of it's driven by economic hardship there, political corruption, criminal violence, but also from beyond Central America and Mexico. A lot of them were coming through the Dari\u00e9n Gap, this part of the Central American Isthmus, from Venezuela, where the situation remains pretty dire there. Ecuador, where there's been a lot of instability in recent months because of criminal violence. Haiti is another source of a lot of migrants. And so these have been surging through Mexico onto the southwest border. What I understand is that since early January 2024, things have declined a little bit, but probably still around 2-3000 a day, which is still an awful lot of people. It's become a major political football if you will. Republicans are holding up support for Ukraine and Israel until the administration adopts certain measures to strengthen, harden the border. And that problem has not yet been resolved. So there's a lot of angles here that I think people are worried about.\n\nMuch like the first threat on our list, this one takes place here at home, but it isn\u2019t as cut and dry to understand. The migration crisis encompasses a complex number of threats, which, taken together, are potentially highly destabilizing.\n\nAccording to foreign policy experts, these threats include the vast suffering of the migrants themselves, deepening instability in source countries, the potential for deadly drugs to slip through the border, and a rapidly escalating border crisis that could involve the U.S. military - all of which cultivate a deepening of the intense political divisiveness we have seen emerge in the U.S. surrounding immigration.\n\nSIERRA: How could this pose a security threat to the United States? What separates it from like a traditional immigration issue?\n\nSTARES: I like to say that migration, per se, should not be considered a national security threat. I think unregulated borders, open borders, can be definitely considered a security concern if you don't know who's coming across. The influx of fentanyl, that's been a big concern. It's causing a lot of deaths in the U.S. So there's definitely that angle. I think it's broadly this concern that it's hard to just assimilate a lot of people all at once. And that creates sort of societal stresses, resentment amongst locals, it burdens social security networks and so on, and health facilities. And overall, that is probably, I think the biggest concern here rather than a kind of traditional national security threat.\n\nSIERRA: It seems like this problem is causing a lot of debate both in D.C. and in our own neighborhoods at home, right. It seems like a really hard problem to fix, so can we do anything about it?\n\nSTARES: You know there's the immediate effort to try to reduce the places along the border where immigrants are coming in a completely unregulated, sometimes in an unsafe way. Sometimes migrants die getting across the border and you obviously want to reduce that happening. So efforts to try to, if you will, harden the border, increase the level of law enforcement so that you're not overwhelmed in any one place. I think the effort that the Biden administration has been trying to focus on in recent months is more sort of upstream efforts to try to encourage the transit countries to dissuade migrants to improve their border security so that they are not becoming a magnet for migrants and trying to sort of say, reduce the flow through Central America. So I think there's lots of ways to do it, but ultimately it's trying to improve the conditions in the principal source countries like Venezuela and Central America, the so-called northern triangle countries, which have been racked by criminal violence and so on. If people feel that they have a future there, they're obviously less likely to come into the U.S. and that I think is the only real solution here.\n\nSIERRA: What feels like is missing is anything related to climate. We\u2019re coming off the warmest year on record, and coverage of fires and floods and drought seemed constant. So is climate just not on the list at all?\n\nSTARES: So climate is indirectly included. I think many of the contingencies include at least implicitly the possibility that either severe weather events or droughts or water shortages or fights over access to water could become a real source of conflict. And so there's several places where that is definitely, I think, an issue - in the Horn of Africa, in the Sahel, maybe even parts of Asia too. So while it's not specifically mentioned in most contingencies, that is definitely part of the mix. There's no question about that. And we're seeing more and more I think concern over the impact of climate change as a driver or an accelerant, if you will, of conflict. It's just very hard to assess the likelihood of specific climate related events and how they would trigger violent conflict. That's always been really difficult to predict in a precise way.\n\nSIERRA: Overall, is there anything on there that you would like to draw more attention to or were even surprised by?\n\nSTARES: I think there's a sort of macro observation this year that really caught my attention. We've never seen this level of anxiety or foreboding about a year in advance. Three of the thirty contingencies were judged to be high likelihood and high impact, and we've never had that. Even last year, I think there wasn't what we call a high-high, a high likelihood high impact, but this year we had three - unprecedented, never happened before. And of the thirty contingencies, only two were considered low probability. Again, pretty scary stuff when you think about it that so many people are really worried about the direction of the world and particularly conflict trends in the world. Something I think I mentioned last year this time was that the countries that were uppermost in the minds of many U.S. foreign policy experts sort of related to, if you will, the kind of post 9/11 agenda. These were countries where the U.S. city either sent troops to fight in or were worried about instability there and drawing in troops down the road. And for many years after 9/11, these parts of the world dominated our concerns about the world. And Afghanistan was up there, Iraq obviously, Pakistan, political instability in Pakistan, the possibility of war between India and Pakistan. These dominated how the U.S. foreign policy community, what their principal concerns were. This year, when you look at what's in the lowest tier, many of those same countries are now considered tier three risks where the impact is now considered low. They're still worried about this happening, but thinking that if it were to happen, the impact on the U.S. wouldn't be so great. So Afghanistan is there, Somalia where there are still U.S. forces, Libya, and as I say, India and Pakistan, and political instability in Pakistan, low impact. When you think about it, Pakistan is a nuclear-armed state and anytime you begin to worry about political instability in a nuclear-armed state, frankly you should be, I think, a little more concerned than people seem to believe in or they either didn't understand the implications here. So that was, I thought, the biggest surprise. I'm always worried moreover that because of the concern given to these tier-one conflicts or potential conflicts, some really terrible humanitarian threats don't get the attention. They tend to sort of now fall down the pecking order in terms of things we worry about. But the situation in Sudan, for instance, it\u2019s been terrible this last year. I think the latest UN reports probably puts 10-15,000 died in Darfur or in Southern Sudan alone. That's a terrible situation. In Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, again, there's been a lot of fighting, a lot of refugees displaced, and these sort of slip down our consciousness about what is going on. And South Sudan, the Sahel, this area of Sub-Saharan Africa in the western part of Africa, is again very unstable. It's had a lot of coups in the last 12, 24 months. These places, most foreign policy experts in the U.S. kind of go, \"huh, well if it happens, it happens. Not much we can do about it.\" And so I do worry about that.\n\nLast year saw conflicts worsen around the world. Chances are this list has probably not left you feeling upbeat. But not all is lost. In fact, some countries improved their relationships this year - potentially making the world safer.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/kXyUsD-j9h8?si=7eLF9siqG5EQOI3h&t=2\n\nDW News: U.S. President Joe Biden says he's made real progress in talks with China's leader Xi Jinping\u2026 They announced new cooperation in areas including narcotics, AI, and avoiding military misunderstandings.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kve55JoZmUI\n\nCGTN Global Watch: Armenia and Azerbaijan have been able to agree on the basic principles for a peace treaty. The treaty includes mutual recognition of territorial integrity and sovereignty.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGkTftoY4yA\n\nReuters: Historical foes Greece and Turkey hope to usher in a new era of closer ties\u2026 They agree to pursue good neighborly relations and work on obstacles that have kept them apart.\n\nSTARES: There hasn't been all doom and gloom last year, and maybe it's easy to get fixated with everything that's deteriorated and increased concerns around the world, and I think that's generally justified. But I think there were some silver linings, if you will, relations between the U.S. and China improved somewhat at the end of 2023. There's an agreement to reestablish military-to-military channels to possibly deal with crises if they happen. So that's welcome. U.S. and China is going to try to do something about this fentanyl drug crisis as well. So that's good. You saw China, by the way, playing a positive role in brokering peace between, or rapprochement probably, between Saudi Arabia and Iran last year, a sign of potential Chinese involvement in sort of global security issues. So that I think is encouraging. You have Armenia and Azerbaijan, they've reached some kind of peace agreement. Now, admittedly, that came after this horrible attack by Azerbaijan on this enclave in Azerbaijan known as Nagorno-Karabakh, and some 50,000 refugees were sort of expelled toward Armenia. Terrible thing, but the situation doesn't look to be as bad as it once looked like it would become. Finally, Greece and Turkey began to talk, and the relations between those two countries are seemingly improving. Last year it was in the survey as a potential flashpoint in the Eastern Mediterranean. Yet in recent months, we've seen the leaders of those two countries begin to talk and possibly move in a more peaceful direction. So, some glimmers of hope there, and we can hope that something happens this coming year, which will also, as I say, improve matters in different parts of the world.\n\nSIERRA: Always worth taking a moment to honor the positives. Perhaps, you could do a sister survey that is the positive prediction survey and next year we can go through that.\n\nSTARES: Wouldn't that be great?\n\nSIERRA: It would be lovely. Well, thank you so much, Paul. You know, obviously our policymakers have their work cut out for them, and we as well have to do our part at the ballot box, but I appreciate you walking us through the next year.\n\nSTARES: It's been great.

        "text": "Political rage on social media is making us cynical\nPolitical anger and cynicism are rising in the United States and in many democracies worldwide, and both are associated with exposure to political attacks on social media, a new University of Michigan study shows.\n\nAmericans use social media to find information and news about politics, but much of the content they see in their feeds is hostile, uncivil and attacking, said lead author Ariel Hasell, assistant professor of communication and media in LSA, and an affiliate of the Center for Political Studies at the Institute for Social Research.\n\nREAD THE STUDY International Journal of Press/Politics\n\nHasell and colleagues investigated whether exposure to political attacks on social media is associated with political cynicism, and if so, whether emotions like anger and anxiety play a role in this process.\n\nThey found that people who were exposed to more political attacks on social media were more politically cynical, and that perceived exposure to these attacks was associated with more anger about the state of the U.S., which was subsequently related to greater levels of political cynicism.\n\nTheir results, based on a panel survey of 1,800 American adults fielded during the 2020 election, were recently published in the International Journal of Press/Politics.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to understand how feelings of cynicism emerge because we\u2019re seeing many democratic governments facing crises of legitimacy,\u201d Hasell said. \u201cOur findings provide some of the first evidence of how exposure to political attacks on social media might relate to political cynicism in the context of a U.S. presidential election.\u201d\n\nHasell and colleagues define political cynicism as an attitude that\u2019s rooted in distrust of political actors\u2019 motivations. It goes further than healthy skepticism, they say, because it involves wholesale rejection of people and processes in democracy, and an underlying belief that politicians are guided by corrupt, self-serving, personal interests, rather than service to the public good.\n\n\u201cCynicism can be a rational response to actual corruption and breaches of trust by those in power,\u201d said co-author Audrey Halversen, a doctoral student in the Department of Communication and Media. \u201cBut it is a matter of concern among scholars of democracy because of its potential to delegitimize democratic processes, reinforce negative attitudes, distort people\u2019s interpretations of political information, and cause some citizens to withdraw from politics.\u201d\n\nPew Research Center polls show the American public\u2019s confidence in government has reached its lowest point in decades, and perceptions that self-interest and corruption are guiding government action have bred cynicism across the political spectrum. The U-M study tested the theory that this increase in cynicism might be linked to political social media use.\n\nSocial media influence\n\nPolitical content on social media is often toxic, and people can expect to see political hostility surge online this summer and fall as the presidential election approaches, Hasell said.\n\nPrior research has shown that political attacks communicated by independent actors (rather than candidates) can be especially influential in shaping political beliefs. Social media algorithms reward and amplify attacks precisely because they\u2019re engaging. Studies show this makes outrage more potent and visible, giving users a warped view of what the public believes.\n\n\u201cIf your main source of news is social media, you are more likely to perceive politics as hostile and angry,\u201d Hasell said. \u201cAnd beyond the feelings that political attacks provoke, it matters how people perceive and read the temperature of \u2018public emotions\u2019 because this can impact assessments about the country\u2019s well-being and its ability to solve problems and accomplish goals.\u201d\n\nThe panel survey in the U-M study asked participants about their social media usage and whether they had been exposed to political attacks against Trump and Republicans, or against Biden and Democrats, on social media. It included a set of questions to measure political cynicism among respondents and asked about their feelings about the state of the U.S. as a country.\n\nAnger and anxiety\n\nPublic anger in American politics has reached a fevered pitch in the last decade, and data show it is rising among American voters heading into the first presidential election since the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.\n\nA 2019 NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found nearly 7 in 10 Americans reported being angry about the political establishment, and a 2023 survey by the Public Religion Research Institute showed that about a quarter of Americans agree that \u201ctrue American patriots may have to resort to violence in order to save our country.\u201d This is up from 15% in 2021.\n\nAnxiety is another negative emotion, which can be elicited by uncertainty, risk aversion and threats, especially if they are vague, unknown or perceived to be beyond one\u2019s control, the researchers said. Political fearmongering and social media toxicity can drive anxiety during a presidential election by creating uncertainty about political outcomes and by creating a generalized sense of political hostility that is beyond an individual\u2019s control.\n\n\u201cNegative emotions are not necessarily bad for democracy,\u201d Hasell said. \u201cEmotions like anxiety and anger can drive people to the polls, motivate advocacy, and get people to seek and think more deeply about political information.\n\n\u201cBut relentless negativity about the state of a country \u2018under threat\u2019 can also make people frustrated, disgruntled and disengaged. Anger can affect our ability to see things as they are and make measured decisions that are important in a democracy.\u201d\n\nA \u2018concerning\u2019 cycle\n\nThe study found evidence that exposure to political attacks on social media contributes to anxiety, anger and political cynicism, but that anger is the emotion that relates to cynicism.\n\n\u201cAs more people turn to social media for news and information, it\u2019s likely that they\u2019ll be more repeatedly exposed to political attacks, which may further promote political cynicism,\u201d Hasell said. \u201cThis is concerning because cynicism can make it harder for people to make sense of political information. It can lead people down a road of apathy and disengagement, or toward fringe parties and antidemocratic forms of participation.\u201d\n\nCan citizens who use social media do anything to break that pattern?\n\n\u201cAn easy way to avoid getting angry and cynical is to be mindful about focusing on nonhostile, civil dialogue,\u201d Hasell said. \u201cIf you are seeing a lot of hostility in your social media, you can think about re-curating and unfollowing people who are fomenting this kind of hostility. We don\u2019t find that social media use in itself is making people angry and cynical, it has to do with how we decide to use it.\u201d\n\nBrian Weeks, associate professor of communication and media in LSA, and a faculty associate in the Center for Political Studies, was also a co-author on the study.",

        "text": "The U.S. Must Invest in its People to Lead Discoveries and Innovations\nNSB News Release\n\nMarch 13, 2024\n\nToday the National Science Board published The State of U.S. Science and Engineering 2024, which shows that although the United States performs more research and development than any other country, the nation\u2019s global position is slipping, as countries in East and Southeast Asia, particularly China, increase their activities.\n\n\u201cThe Indicators report confirms that our nation\u2019s science and engineering (S&E) enterprise increasingly hinges on foreign-born STEM talent and is limited by flat federal R&D investment, all at a time when global innovation continues to accelerate,\u201d said Daniel Reed, Chair of the National Science Board and Presidential Professor of Computational Science at the University of Utah. \u201cMeanwhile, other countries are heavily investing in their own S&E talent development, next-generation research infrastructure, and the advanced technology areas critical to national defense and global economic competitiveness.\u201d\n\nThe science, technology, engineering, and mathematics workforce drives U.S. innovation, which is the linchpin of the nation\u2019s economic and national security. The nation must take action to grow and support domestic talent that is currently left on the sidelines.\n\n\u201c The nation must take action to grow and support domestic talent that is currently left on the sidelines.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must use policies, like a new National Defense and Education Act, and appropriate robust funding to federal science agencies, including through the CHIPS and Science Act, to ensure that our nation does not continue to lose ground to others,\u201d Reed said.\n\nThe report shows the outsized role that foreign-born scientists and engineers play in U.S. competitiveness, especially at the doctoral level. It also reveals how the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted S&E education and research, and negatively impacted mathematics scores for American elementary and secondary students.\n\nThe comprehensive report demonstrates that the U.S. no longer predominates across all elements of science, technology, and innovation. Instead, the nation is distinguished by the strength of its universities as destinations for international students, its highly cited and collaborative research, and its leadership in knowledge and technology intensive services, which include information technology and other information services, scientific R&D services, and software publishing.\n\n\u201cThis report shows the tremendous strength of American research and development, which is the most powerful innovation engine in history\u201d said Arati Prabhakar, Assistant to the President for Science and Technology and Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology. \u201cPresident Biden often says that America can be defined in one word: possibilities. Together, public and private R&D investments are opening new possibilities so we can achieve our nation\u2019s great aspirations.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe United States has long led the pursuit of revolutionary science and impactful innovation,\u201d said Sethuraman Panchanathan, Director of the U.S. National Science Foundation. \u201cWith each Indicators report, we witness new insights and shifting trends from within the nation and beyond our borders. However, this latest report delivers an urgent message: For the U.S. to maintain leadership in science and technology, and the societal and economic impacts that result, we must invest in and accelerate our commitment to STEM and ensure that we unleash our superpower\u2014the collective experiences and motivations from individuals across our entire nation\u2014to the benefit of all.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is time to act, with vision and commitment, by expanding our domestic STEM worker pool, investing in critical science and technology areas, and building the necessary research and development infrastructure to ensure our continued national security and economic independence. The job is not done, and we neglect it at our peril,\u201d Reed said.\n\nOther highlights\n\nResearch and Development: The United States is the largest performer of R&D, with $806 billion in gross domestic expenditures on R&D in 2021. Other top R&D- performing countries include China ($668 billion), Japan ($177 billion), Germany ($154 billion), and South Korea ($120 billion). The United States is also among the world\u2019s most R&D-intensive economies, with R&D expenditures equaling 3.5% of its gross domestic product in 2021.\n\nPublications: Globally, six countries combined produced more than 50% of the worldwide peer-reviewed S&E publications in 2022: China (27%), the United States (14%), India (6%), Germany (3%), the United Kingdom (3%), and Japan (3%). From 2003 to 2022, annual S&E publications increased by roughly a third (36%) in the United States, whereas they increased approximately 10-fold in China and 8-fold in India.\n\nOpen Access: Open-access publications provide free access to peer-reviewed scientific literature without requiring user fees or journal subscriptions. S&E articles published in open-access journals increased over 50-fold in the past two decades, from 19,000 articles published in 2003 to 992,000 articles in 2022.\n\nElementary and Secondary Education: From 2020 to 2023, the average score on a national mathematics assessment for all 13-year-old students dropped by 9 points. Scores for students in the 10th percentile \u2014 those scoring near the low end of all assessment takers \u2014 dropped by 14 points, whereas scores for students in the 90th percentile dropped by 6 points. As a result, the gap between students scoring in the 10th percentile (213) and the 90th percentile (322) widened to 109 points, the largest it has been since the assessment began in 1978.\n\nSTEM Workforce: In 2021, the U.S. STEM workforce comprised 36.8 million people in diverse occupations that require STEM knowledge and expertise, accounting for 24% of the total U.S. workforce. Just over half of STEM workers, or 19.3 million workers, are part of the skilled technical workforce, which means they do not have bachelor\u2019s degrees or higher. Foreign-born individuals made up 19% of all U.S. STEM workers and 43% of doctoral-level scientists and engineers.\n\nKnowledge- and Technology-Intensive (KTI) Industries: The U.S. is the largest provider of KTI services, with $1.3 trillion in value-added output in 2021. KTI industries are those classified by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development as high R&D intensive and medium-high R&D intensive industries based on R&D intensity. U.S. KTI services\u2019 output more than doubled from 2012 to 2021, increasing the U.S. share of global KTI services from 30% in 2012 to 39% in 2021, nearly twice the EU-27\u2019s share (21%) of global KTI services in 2021.\n\nInvention and Innovation: Inventors based in China surpassed those based in the U.S. for international total patent applications for the first time in 2021. Patents issued by the Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) focus on inventions, both foreign and domestic, that are granted exclusive use rights in the U.S. market. Of the 325,000 USPTO utility patents granted in 2022, a total of 142,000 (44%) were granted to U.S. inventors. Foreign inventors\u2019 share of patents increased from 52% in 2012 to 56% in 2022.\n\nPublic Perceptions: Americans\u2019 degree of trust in scientists has remained high for decades, although it varies by level of education and has fluctuated in recent years. In 2022, 77% of adults in the United States expressed either \u201ca great deal\u201d or \u201ca fair amount\u201d of confidence in scientists to act in the best interests of the public.\n\nAbout Science and Engineering Indicators\n\nScience and Engineering Indicators is a congressionally mandated report on the state of the U.S. and international science and engineering enterprise. Indicators provides high-quality quantitative information on the enterprise in a series of reports and a data tool that provides state-level data.\n\nAbout the NSB\n\nThe National Science Foundation Act of 1950 charged the NSB with two roles: to be the governing board of the NSF and an advisor to Congress and the President on policy matters related to STEM research and STEM education. Selected for their distinguished service and accomplishments in academia, government, and the private sector, the Board\u2019s 24 presidentially appointed members are leaders in STEM research and education.\n\nAbout the NCSES\n\nNSF\u2019s National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES) is the nation's leading provider of statistical data on the U.S. science and engineering enterprise. As a principal federal statistical agency, NCSES serves as a clearinghouse for the collection, interpretation, analysis, and dissemination of objective science and engineering data.\n\nMedia Contact: Elizabeth Jeffers, ejeffers@nsf.gov\n\nThe U.S. National Science Foundation propels the nation forward by advancing fundamental research in all fields of science and engineering. NSF supports research and people by providing facilities, instruments and funding to support their ingenuity and sustain the U.S. as a global leader in research and innovation. With a fiscal year 2023 budget of $9.5 billion, NSF funds reach all 50 states through grants to nearly 2,000 colleges, universities and institutions. Each year, NSF receives more than 40,000 competitive proposals and makes about 11,000 new awards. Those awards include support for cooperative research with industry, Arctic and Antarctic research and operations, and U.S. participation in international scientific efforts.\n\nUseful NSB Web Sites:\n\nHome Page: http://www.nsf.gov/nsb\n\nMedia Contact: http://www.nsf.gov/staff/staff_bio.jsp?lan=nlymn&org=NSF\n\nNews: http://www.nsf.gov/nsb/news\n\nMeetings: http://www.nsf.gov/nsb/meetings\n\nPublications: http://www.nsf.gov/nsb/publications\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/NationalScienceBoard\n\nTwitter: Twitter: https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=NSF_NSB\n\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkrHRzuGSrPp2haQs0T_Pww\n\n",

        "text": "2024 Fall First-Year Seminars\n1. Humans & Nature: Fighting for Green in a Gray World\n\n\n\nNature is supposed to be a \u201cgreat equalizer\u201d whose resources are free, universal, and all-inclusive. However, there is a multitude of literature on the lack of diversity and inclusion in outdoor spaces, and there is evidence that socially and economically disadvantaged populations have limited access to green space in urban areas. A nature gap clearly exists, and we need to be creative in our approaches to increasing access to nature, especially in urban areas. In this course, we will work to understand the various perceptions of nature and the varying relationships with nature that may occur in our community. We will also work to examine the key concepts concerning nature\u2019s relation to welfare, injustice, and change, to think critically about nature\u2019s role in our daily lives and the urban environment. We will explore these relationships through community walks, field trips, readings, and discussions.\n\nProfessor: Allyssa Decker\n\nTime: MWF 12:30-1:20\n\n\n\n2. HIP, HIP, Hooray! Crafting Your Future Through Transformative Learning Experiences\n\n\n\nWhat do you want to get out of your college education? What types of learning experiences do you want to pursue? How can you plan for impactful and transformative learning? Our seminar will explore \u201cHigh-Impact Practices\u201d (HIPs) in higher education, which include first-year seminars, service-learning, undergraduate research, internships, study abroad, and more. The pursuit of multiple experiential learning opportunities and HIPs can influence a student\u2019s goals, educational gains, and outcomes. Research shows a positive association between HIP participation and student engagement, integrated learning, and gains for all students, particularly among underrepresented, new majority, and first-generation students. But how equitable and accessible are HIPs, and how can students maximize their educational journeys? We will explore the history, barriers, and benefits of HIPs that are \u201cdone well.\u201d Students will engage in discussions and presentations, conduct research on HIPs and active learning strategies, connect with professionals and peers, and think deeply about their own experiences and goals. They will complete an interview project with alumni, identify goals, and write an ePortfolio/action plan to reflect upon their personal growth, academic growth, and future pursuits of HIPs across their time at Dickinson.\n\nProfessor: Amity Fox\n\nTime: MWF 11:30-12:20\n\n\n\n3. Small Screen, Big Picture: Religion on Television\n\n\n\nSome of the most popular shows on TV engage themes of religion and morality. Whether we are talking about the overt \u201ctelevangelism\u201d of the The 700 Club in the 1960\u2019s, the vision of the afterlife imagined in The Good Place, or Ted Lasso\u2019s pandemic-era call to \u201cBELIEVE,\u201d television is a powerful medium for conveying a uniquely American understanding of religion. What religious perspectives tend to be represented on TV? Why are viewers captivated by the \u201csecular spirituality\u201d and redemption narratives that drive so many successful shows? How do religion and politics intersect in these portrayals? In this seminar, we will study a wide range of programs from the last 50 years that have both mirrored and shaped our understanding of religion in the US. Students will learn to do close analysis of individual episodes and series, guided by readings from the disciplines of religion and media studies.\n\nProfessor: Andrea Lieber\n\nTime: MW 11:30-12:45\n\n4. Introduction to Community\n\n\n\nWhat is \u201ccommunity,\u201d and where do you fit in? From 2009 through 2014 Community was a popular television sitcom that presented the trials and tribulations of a mismatched college study group turned unlikely friends. Over six seasons these characters navigated what it means to be a constructive member of a community \u2013 not only at Greendale Community College, the fictional setting of the series, but also in relation to larger social systems, within various subcultures, and even across a meta/multiverse. This course consists of four core units with different themes. Alluding to the TV show\u2019s storyline, these sections represent four \u201cclasses\" and playfully imitate a full-semester course load. The seminar\u2019s units include: \u201cApplied Dungeons & Dragons,\u201d \u201cThe Art of Art,\u201d \u201cCarlisle 101,\u201d and \u201cIntroduction to Community: The Darkest Timeline.\u201d Although individual projects and discussions will vary according to the topic of each \u201ccourse,\u201d students will examine the common premise of community engagement and civic leadership through critical thinking and college-level research and writing throughout the semester. This course will require students to occasionally meet outside of class to play table-top games, work on projects in the Dickinson College art studios, and participate in a walking tour of Carlisle, among other activities.\n\nProfessor: Anthony Cervino\n\nTime: MW 11:30-12:45\n\n5. The Multiverse of Mythology\n\n\n\nAt first glance, the multiverse appears to be a modern construct, a device that allows writers the opportunity to expand the canon of what we know about pop culture. But myths and legends have been changing and morphing for centuries. Minus the time travel, ancient authors have been playing with classical myths and creating their own \u201creality\u201d of those myths since before the concept of time travel even existed. In this course, we\u2019ll investigate myths and legends from all over the world. And we\u2019ll be looking at how authors were playing with their audience\u2019s expectations long before it was seen as edgy or cool to do so. We will look at how, through adaptation and reworking, mythmakers create meaning by changing key details of the preexisting mythological universe, and how, in other cases, strikingly similar mythological archetypes arise completely independently, as if in parallel mythical universes, driven by the same quasi-biological imperatives. This course will feature various ancient myths through varied media from podcasts (harkening back to the oral origins of the genre) to the written word. In addition to the classical sources, we\u2019ll also be looking toward the future, and thinking about what elements of modern pop culture might eventually reach mythical status.\n\n\n\nProfessor: Ashley Roman\n\nTime: MF 11:30-12:45\n\n\n\n6. Do Stories Make Us Human?\n\n\n\nStories play a deep and important role in how we experience and interpret our lives. We daydream constantly, weaving stories that envision possible future events, or imagine how things might have turned out differently. We crave to tell others about anything even mildly interesting that happens to us. Politics, dreams, news, and even scientific theories come to us in the form of stories, and those stories can shape the way we experience the world, build communities, and understand ourselves. During this course, students will learn different approaches to make sense of stories in our lives, share their own stories, and consider how story is a core feature of the way we, as humans, experience the world and our role in it. We will think about how stories evolved as an important part of our species, homo sapiens, and how stories imbue our lives with meaning. Using psychology as our primary perspective, we\u2019ll look at how stories can unite and divide us and consider all the ways in which stories are uniquely human.\n\nProfessor: Azriel Grysman\n\nTime: MW 11:30-12:45\n\n\n\n7. Neither chimp nor computer: What, if anything, makes us human?\n\n\n\nHumans use tools and pass down culture to their children. But so do chimps. Humans make art and write poetry. But so can AI. In this class, we will explore what makes us uniquely human by examining that which is almost, but not quite, human. We will interrogate how humanity has historically defined itself, the degree to which other primates think like humans (e.g., does a chimp have empathy, self-awareness, language, or culture?), the legal efforts to grant personhood to animals, the ways people with brain damage or neurodivergent thinking have sometimes been treated as less than human, and how we can know if or when artificial intelligence becomes conscious. During the semester, we will discuss controversial readings, document a semester-long growing relationship with an AI chatbot, host a podcast about human uniqueness, and take a trip to observe other primates at a working primate research facility.\n\nProfessor: Ben Basile\n\nTime: MWF 12:30-1:20\n\n\n\n8. Race in Brazil: Challenging Discourses\n\n\n\nCoined in the early 1940\u2019s, the term \u201cracial democracy\u201d claimed that Brazil did not have racial discrimination, yet nothing could have been further from the truth. Despite Black authors, intellectuals, and activists immediately refuting it, the term is still being used as an accurate description of racial politics in Brazil and as such, it represents a constant attempt to erase the history and realities of the majority of Brazilians. This seminar then analyzes how Black Brazilians have been represented since the nineteenth century in Brazil and, mainly, how they have represented themselves. It aims to expose and question the power operating behind discourses that refer to slavery, inequalities, marginalization, and the false notion of \u201cracial democracy.\u201d In the seminar, we will read a variety of literary texts (poems, short stories, and a novel) foregrounding how Black Brazilian authors have challenged and resisted racist discourses and structural discrimination.\n\nProfessor: Carolina Castellanos\n\nTime: MF 11:30-12:45\n\n\n\n9. Ideas that have Shaped the World\n\n\n\nWhy do ideas matter? What is the relationship between the individual and community? How can we define human nature? What is justice? Are there universal moral principles? Or are our actions considered moral according to the moment and place in which we find ourselves? Explore these and other fundamental issues of humanistic inquiry through a series of compelling and influential texts. Faculty members from several different disciplines will join with students to read and discuss the work of authors as diverse as Homer, Plato, Augustine, Shakespeare, Jefferson, Descartes, Marx, Darwin, Du Bois, Duras, and Achebe, among others. The reading list is focused on the question, \u201cHow do the ideas of these authors \u2013 all from different cultures and eras -- resonate across time and help us to understand our present experience within a global community?\u201d Furthermore, studying carefully the work of outstanding thinkers, readers, and writers is one of the best ways to learn to read, think, and write well yourself.\n\nProfessor: Christopher Bilodeau\n\nTime: MF 11:30-12:45\n\n\n\n10. Cancelled\n\n11. You Contain Multitudes: The Microbiome in Human Health and Disease\n\n\n\nThere are currently trillions of microorganisms in, on, and around your body. Some of these microbes are pathogenic and can make you sick, but many are neutral or even beneficial. This sea of microbes that you inhabit is known as your microbiome, and it plays an important role in many aspects of human health, including metabolism, neurological function, and immunity. However, the importance of the human microbiome is sometimes misrepresented or exaggerated. In this seminar, we will investigate studies of the human microbiome that have revealed new insights into evolution, human health, and disease, and we will learn how to critically evaluate these reports of scientific research. Utilizing different readings, video clips, and guest speakers, we will engage in informed discussions, develop academic writing skills, and analyze the significance of the human microbiome.\n\nProfessor: Dana Somers\n\nTime: MW 11:30-12:45\n\n12. Reading on the Edge of Your Seat: The Art of the Short Story\n\n\n\nWhat makes a great story? What are the building blocks of the short story, and the techniques writers employ to bring readers to the edge of their seats and keep them reading? Students will explore answers to these questions as they read a wide variety of short stories and critically analyze them and how they are constructed. They will also apply what they learn as they craft their own short stories and critically evaluate them.\n\nProfessor: Elise Bartosik-Velez\n\nTime: MW 11:30-12:45\n\n13. The Uses and Abuses of Photography\n\n\n\nSince its invention, the camera has often been regarded as a scientific instrument that objectively transcribes what appears before it. Yet as early as the Civil War, when the bodies of fallen soldiers were staged by photographers to enhance the narratives around their deaths, the notion of photography as a record of unmediated truth has come under doubt. This class begins with key readings on the nature and history of photography before examining some of the ways the medium of photography lays claim to \u201ctruth.\u201d We will consider how photographs participate in power structures and institutions of authority, with an emphasis on how the camera has been used to shape not only public opinion, but also policy and law around areas of gender, race, and ethnicity. Students will also work with photographic collections at the Dickinson Archives and The Trout Gallery during the semester and learn about historic photographic practices through darkroom facilities on campus.\n\nProfessor: Elizabeth Lee\n\nTime: WF 11:30-12:45\n\n14. Cancelled\n\n15. Good and Evil in the Human Imagination: Ethics in Fiction\n\n\n\nThis seminar\u2019s topic investigates fictional representations of ethics. It asks what makes fiction such a good vehicle for the exploration of ethical dilemmas. One reason is that morality tales and voyages of discovery can help us in the quest for identity. They help us to think about how to lead a good life, how to find ourselves, and how to be a part of a community, bound to families, friends, and commitments. In this class, we will explore these issues by considering moral and ethical theory through major works of contemporary fiction, in both film and book versions. We will consider the vision of society and of individual responsibility in these works, apply these examples to approaches to ethics in contemporary philosophy, and compare the depictions of ethics across different genres such as fantasy, mystery, and science fiction. Students will have the opportunity to develop a research project on their own favorite work of fiction.\n\nProfessor: Toby Reiner\n\nTime: MF 11:30-12:45\n\n16. Civil Disobedience in History\n\n\n\nThis seminar will discuss and define the concept of \u201ccivil disobedience\u201d based on the writings of theorists such as Henry David Thoreau and Martin Luther King, Jr. We will analyze case studies of civil disobedience in action, including Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s satyagraha (non-violent resistance) in South Africa and India; sit-ins organized by the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC); and the occupation of federal land by the Standing Rock Sioux and allies to block the Dakota Access pipeline. Our focus will be on non-violent disobedience, but we will also explore whether violence is ever justified. Students will research, write, and produce a podcast showcasing an act of civil disobedience.\n\n\n\nProfessor: Jeremy Ball\n\nTime: MWF 11:30-12:20\n\n\n\n17. Fear Factor: A Multi-Disciplinary Exploration\n\n\n\nFamed author of twentieth century horror H.P. Lovecraft wrote that \u201cthe oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear...\u201d. And indeed, from Aristotle to Dante to Alfred Hitchcock, the exploration of fear underlies a large swath of cultural and personal expression. In this seminar, students will confront some of humanity\u2019s most anxious concerns. Borrowing from multiple disciplines, including religion, philosophy, literature, art history, anthropology, psychology, sociology, and more, students will consider fear in both individual and collective contexts. We will ask such questions as: What is fear? What purposes does it serve? How have humans expressed, interpreted, and cultivated the experience of fear in meaningful ways? We will consider \u201clow-stakes\u201d examples like the common fear of public speaking, as well as more complex existential fears, such as the fear of death. We will consider tools and mechanisms that people have developed in order to cope with or counteract fear, as well as cultural products and art that grapple with the theme conceptually. Primary documents will be drawn from myriad sources including classic literature, modern horror film, and religious art. Students should be prepared to engage with sensitive topics ranging from (but not limited to) violence, racism, sexuality and gender, and religion.\n\nProfessor: Jodie Vann\n\nTime: WF 11:30-12:45\n\n18. The 2024 US Presidential Election: Is Dialogue across Difference Possible?\n\n\n\nThis seminar looks at the upcoming US Presidential election and asks, amid a siloed media environment, highly partisan politics, and disagreement over truth itself, whether dialogue across differences is possible in our current moment. Although we will be immersing ourselves in the political coverage of the US election, this seminar is neither about the \u201chorse race\u201d of the election, nor the underlying political forces at play. Rather, we will be learning how to listen to those with whom we disagree, examine the barriers to mutual understanding, and practice skills to dialogue across difference. Our primary texts will be the media coverage of the 2024 US presidential election in which students will read and view media from a variety of sources reflecting a range of ideological commitments. We will examine and analyze the examples of popular political media that students bring into the class, learning and using tools that allow us to grapple in meaningful ways with viewpoints that differ from our own. Importantly, the goal will not be to find a way to \u201cmeet in the middle,\u201d but rather for each participant in the seminar to strive to understand the perspectives of those who disagree with them, so that we may complicate our own understandings of the critical and complex issues at stake in this election. For the final project students will develop a TED talk that captures an aspect of what they have learned about dialoging across difference.\n\nProfessor: John Katunich\n\nTime: MWF 11:30-12:20\n\n\n\n19. I'm the Universe\n\n\n\nLike most metaphors, \u201cI\u2019m the universe\u201d is a false statement. Then why use this metaphor? As the seminar title suggests, the study of the \u2018I\u2019 will be the focus and the study of the universe will be secondary. Yet by studying the relationship between both, we will better understand the relationship between what we believe we are and how the universe has shaped that belief. We will ask: What constitutes the universe? Am I part of the universe? What is truth? How did I come to define who I am? These and other questions will be addressed in this seminar through theoretical readings, empirical studies, and artistic expressions across literature, art, film, biographies, and autobiographies. Through this seminar, students will develop the ability to draw analytical conclusions from studying ideas in an interdisciplinary manner, while also dialoguing about them verbally and expressing them in clear writing for academic purposes.\n\nProfessor: Jorge R. G. Sagastume\n\nTime: WF 11:30-12:45\n\n\n\n20. Collaborative Visual Story Telling\n\n\n\nFrom cave paintings to emojis, our ancestors have always found universal means of communication beyond the limitation of language. We are constantly (sometimes unknowingly, sometimes secretly) creating, signaling, and expressing to others who we are and how we exist in this world we share. In this epoch of the 21st century characterized by a dismantling of traditional hierarchies and a rise in collaborative power infrastructures, the myth of the lone genius is finally fading and in its place is a shift to collaboratives and ensembles. This course embraces this focus on community, exploring the boundaries and impotence of words, in order to delve into alternative forms of expression. This class will utilize the basic tools of reading and writing to interrogate the power and limitations of language, while exploring the rich history of collaborative visual story telling from ancient symbols to modern comics. Through hands-on, project-based work, we will transform theory into action. We will design impactful signage for the Dickinson College Farm, creating a visual dialogue with the land and its stewards. We will craft posters and stickers that amplify the voices of campus organizations and community initiatives. And as an ensemble, the class will culminate with a dynamic, performative work, which will be collectively created, fusing visual story telling with the combined student voices and creative energies. This course is more than just a class; it's a collaborative laboratory for experimentation, expression, and connection. You'll leave with new skills and perspectives, but also a stronger sense of belonging and the power of collective creativity to illicit change.\n\nProfessor: Kent Barrett\n\nTime: MW 11:30-12:45\n\n\n\n21. Exploring conflict: Events big and small that affect daily life for us all\n\n\n\nDisagreements. Arguments. Fights. Battles. Wars. These kinds of events originate from conflict, which in turn evolves from some kernel of difference: difference of experience, opinion, interpretation, understanding, or agenda. Addressing conflict can occur via discussion, facilitation, mediation, resolution, or diplomacy. Conflict occurs on every scale including and beyond just two people: at the interpersonal, societal, national, and/or global levels. Maybe you have discovered your own conflict style: do you like to argue? Or do you avoid conflict at all costs? Or something in between? In this course we will explore conflict. We will investigate the origins and nature of conflict, and modes for addressing it. We will employ case studies to investigate conflict on different scales, and view conflict in our own lives and on our own campus. We\u2019ll explore conflict to develop skills in the areas of critical analysis, writing, and information literacy. We\u2019ll also explore our own personal conflict styles and identify and practice effective tools to address conflict that is in our own power.\n\nProfessor: Kirsten Guss\n\nTime: WF 11:30-12:45\n\n\n\n22. Bizarrchaeology: Evaluating What We Believe About the Past\n\n\n\nKnowing the past is powerful. Archaeologists collect evidence of past human activity so that we can better understand ancient societies and what it means to be human. But new discoveries are made regularly that force us to revise our conventional theories. While archaeology is an evidence-based discipline grounded in practical theories, methodologies, and analysis, romanticized depictions in popular culture skew public perception of how the past is studied. This confusion\u2014alongside over 100 years of archaeological hoaxes and fakes\u2014has generated misunderstanding and conspiracy theories concerning what we know about past societies. This often makes it difficult to distinguish academically supported hypotheses from fictitious facades. How do we evaluate what we know about the ancient past? What is the danger in uncritically accepting hoaxes and misinformation? In this course, we will read scholarship, watch films, and visit a museum to evaluate archaeological knowledge and ongoing debates. We will assess the legitimacy of notable fakes and hoaxes in archaeology, being deliberate or accidental distortions, and how they cloud people\u2019s understanding of the past. By evaluating archaeological fakes and hoaxes, we will critically examine, discuss, and debate what we know about the past, why fantastical claims about past cultures harm present-day people, and how these ideas are relevant to the contemporary world.\n\nProfessor: Matthew Biwer\n\nTime: MWF 11:30-12:20\n\n\n\n23. Cancelled\n\n\n\n24. War\u2026What is it good for? Absolutely Nothing!\n\n\n\nRecent years have been marked by several armed conflicts around the globe: Armenia, Haiti, Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Ukraine. With horror, the world watched the Israel \u2013 Palestine war unfold, with an unprecedented number of journalists, medical staff, and children killed in Gaza. This seminar invites students to think about war, shared values, and humanity by exploring veterans\u2019 and civilians\u2019 war narratives. The aim is to study these stories to understand the intersectionality of violence with trauma, gender, and moral values. Some of the questions that this seminar will explore are related to the uses of war: Is war necessary? Can war be just? How do veterans tell their war stories? What is the impact of war on women? To answer these questions, this seminar will explore western and non-western texts and films starting with World War I through today.\n\nProfessor: Mireille Rebeiz\n\nTime: MW 11:30-12:45\n\n25. Prophet and Philosopher: Science Fiction in Multimedia\n\n\n\nScience fiction often seems to predict the future, a notion exemplified by how we currently live in a world that mirrors many of its forecasts. The 1960s' Star Trek, with its Tricorder, anticipated the advent of today's mobile phones, while 2001: A Space Odyssey foreshadowed video calling similar to FaceTime. Our reality now also includes genetically modified food, autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and virtual reality, all once mere figments of science fiction. Despite these advancements, some concepts remain elusive, such as interstellar travel, time travel, consciousness uploading, and robots indistinguishable from humans. Science fiction authors, akin to prophets and philosophers, challenge us to consider the profound impacts of scientific and technological advancements on human society and life. These themes are not just speculative; they are embodied in characters from science fiction literature, like mathematician Hari Seldon from the Foundation series and Sartre in Bao Shu's \"What Has Past Shall in Kinder Light Appear,\" a seminal work in Chinese science fiction. This course invites an exploration of these themes through the analysis of science fiction stories, films, comics, and TV dramas. It will prompt reflection on profound questions posed by these \"prophets\" and \"philosophers\": the nature of reality and human agency, the history and future of space exploration, the interaction between robots and humans, the concept of 'bodies of tomorrow' and 'animal alterity', and the essence of time and our identity. This course will delve into how science fiction interacts with traditional academic literary genres as a mass cultural genre, offering a new lens to understand the interplay between fictionality and reality.\n\nProfessor: Nan Ma\n\nTime: MF 11:30-12:45\n\n\n\n26. Contested Campus: Key Issues in Higher Education\n\n\n\nHigher education is in a contentious era in which its core purposes and practices are being hotly debated. The seminar will examine several key issues, focusing on these issues in liberal arts colleges and especially at Dickinson College. After an introductory discussion of the purposes of a college education, we will turn to questions, such as: What is the role of free speech in an era of cancel culture? What role should Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) efforts play in higher education? How is access to college determined? Was affirmative action a good idea? How is (or isn\u2019t) artificial intelligence (AI) changing higher education? Seminar participants will also have an opportunity to explore a key issue in higher education of their own choosing.\n\nProfessor: Neil Weissman\n\nTime: MF 11:30-12:45\n\n\n\n27. African American Food and Identity in American Popular Culture\n\n\n\nThe recent Netflix docuseries, High on the Hog: How African American Cuisine Transformed America, investigates the ways in which food not only embodies African Americans\u2019 ancestral heritage, but also marks shifts in Black identity construction historically and contemporarily. This seminar draws on the series' discussions of these culinary phenomena by examining the links between African American foodways and identity as conceived in the American popular imagination from the 19th century to present day. We will begin by reading the histories of specific foods that are associated with African American culture. Subsequently, we will analyze how these foods have been used to fashion a range of paradoxical racial figures, from the stereotypical Black chicken thief and watermelon lover to the agential soul brother/sister, food rebel, and hip-hop vegan. In addition, we will consider the popular modes and media that transmit the meanings and controversies engendered by these constructed identities that ultimately become stored in social memory. The popular modes and media on which we will focus include commercial food advertisements rooted in plantation caricatures (i.e., Aunt Jemima, Uncle Ben); restaurants and menus; African American soul, blues, and hip-hop music; food blogs; internet memes; short stories; television (The Boondocks); and film (Soul Food Junkies).\n\nProfessor: Lynn Johnson\n\nTime: MF 11:30-12:45\n\n\n\n28. The Art of the Detective in Fiction and Film\n\n\n\nThis seminar will examine the widespread appeal of detective fiction and film. Characters and plots in this genre are driven by issues of power, crime, and law, as well as gender, desire, politics, class, race, individuality, and society\u2014just to name a few. At the heart of this literature is the suspense of unanswered questions: Who is it? Whodunnit? How do we know? What do we know? How could we interpret? How should we understand? These are uncertainties of identity, epistemology, and hermeneutics, and our course will think about what is at stake in asking these kinds of questions. Through the art of close reading\u2014that is, following the clues left for you in the text\u2014 you will become investigators of the cultural messages and constructs presented in detective fiction and film. Over the course of the semester, we will examine short stories and novels such as The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, The Maltese Falcon, and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. In addition, we will consider noir and neo-noir films such as Double Indemnity, Rear Window, and episodes from the Veronica Mars series and the BBC\u2019s Sherlock. Alongside the fiction and film, the class will read critical and philosophical essays that provide clues to historical contexts, theoretical frameworks, and rhetorical tactics used to foster audiences\u2019 experiences of mystery and suspense.\n\nProfessor: Sarah Kersh\n\nTime: WF 11:30-12:45\n\n\n\n29. 28 N College Street: Political Geography and the Power of Place\n\n\n\nWhat is the relationship between geographic locations and issues of power, privilege, wealth, and identity? How have governmental policies created and reinforced segregation in the United States? How have people sorted themselves into communities and limited their interactions with people different than themselves? In this class, we will consider how political and social forces both affect and have been affected by the places we live. Together, we will read selections from texts such as The Big Sort, The Color of Law, and The Address Book among others. Students will be asked to think about the places they have lived and how those environments have shaped their views on politics, religion, and their overall lifestyles. In the second half of the course, we will use Carlisle as our laboratory as we visit the Cumberland County Historical Society, learn about the Carlisle Indian Industrial School, experience local government via Borough Council meetings, and engage in walking tours of various neighborhoods adjacent to campus. Throughout the semester, students will gain hands-on research skills as they examine an aspect of the built environment in Carlisle, the political processes that created it, and the human behavior that results from it.\n\nProfessor: Sarah Niebler\n\nTime: MWF 11:30-12:20\n\n\n\n30. How the US Institutionalized Racism\n\n\n\nIn recent years, racial justice activists, journalists and scholars have helped to create a national conversation about institutional, or systemic, racism in the United States. They have highlighted how institutional racism shapes housing, education, the criminal legal system, health outcomes and more. But systemic racism does not just appear; it takes work and intention to create places and systems that work for some and not for others. So, how did the US institutionalize racism over time? How did race get used to shape the places we live and work, the systems and spaces that we move within, and our chances to live economically comfortable lives? In this class, we will explore how racism became institutionalized throughout the 20th century in a number of key American systems related to criminal justice, education, health, work, housing, politics and state welfare. Secondary sources by historians like Ibram Kendi and Carol Anderson will provide broad overviews on the history of these systems. Then, by exploring red-lining maps, voter disenfranchisement legislation, oral histories, and other primary sources, we will work to understand how racism got \u201cbaked into\u201d the US\u2019s social fabric \u2013 usually without explicit racial exclusion. Our explorations will also take us into local archives, including the Dickinson College Archives and Special Collections. This class will focus on the ways in which institutional racism sought to marginalize or exclude African Americans in particular, yet we will also look at the ways in which it affected a range of other peoples.\n\nProfessor: Say Burgin\n\nTime: MF 11:30-12:45\n\n\n\n31. Machines Among Us: The Social Life of AI, Algorithms, and Digital Automation\n\n\n\nArtificial intelligence and algorithmic processes were once of interest only to mathematicians and computer scientists. But today our everyday lives are subtly influenced on a daily, hourly, or even minute-by-minute basis by the operations of AI, algorithms, and other digital machines. This seminar looks beyond technical understandings to examine our evolving relationship with digital technology. We will think about how digital processes shape the performance of work, the provision of care, the exercise of power, the persistence of inequality, and the manufacture of taste. We will be guided by the ideas of technology theorists, the research of social scientists, and selected works of cultural criticism and science fiction.\n\nProfessor: Shawn Bender\n\nTime: MF 11:30-12:45\n\n\n\n32. Sex and Sexuality in the Italian Middle Ages\n\n\n\nOur understanding of sex and sexuality is inherently linked to the historical period in which we live. In this seminar, the Italian Middle Ages will be the lens through which we explore these notions. No other historical period is as misunderstood today as the Middle Ages, and Italy provides us with a rich pathway to explore the late medieval period, eventually culminating in what we now define as the Italian Renaissance. This seminar will be comparative in nature, exploring similarities and differences in notions of sex and sexuality between the Italian Late Middle Ages and present-day United States. The aim is to gain insights into the evolution of societal attitudes towards sex and sexuality over time. The course will include a theoretical component, addressing sexuality from various perspectives such as sex within marriage, reproduction, chastity, ethics and immoral behavior, sex work, race, religion, and sexual violence. Alongside the theoretical part of this course, we will analyze and explore Italian literary texts (in English translation) from the period. Works such as Dante Alighieri\u2019s \"Divine Comedy\" and Giovanni Boccaccio\u2019s \"Decameron\" will allow us to delve into these notions through late medieval Italian art and literature.\n\nProfessor: James McMenamin\n\nTime: MW 11:30-12:45\n\n\n\n33. The Not so Beautiful Game? Thinking about Football (Soccer) Culture in Britain\n\n\n\nWhy are the British obsessed with football? Why are much of the rest of the world obsessed with Britain\u2019s obsession with football? In this seminar we will engage in an in-depth exploration of many aspects \u2013 beautiful and not-so beautiful \u2013 of British football culture. Along the way we will encounter and write about a number of iconic and legendary figures such as Brian Clough (Derby, Nottingham Forest), Don Revie (Leeds) and Bill Shankly (Liverpool), and a bevy of late 1960s and early-mid 1970s happy-go-lucky but ultimately misunderstood geniuses like George Best, Stan Bowles, and Rodney Marsh. Throughout the semester we will juxtapose aspects of the truly beautiful game, such as the Cruyff turn and Fila ski jumpers, with aspects of the not-so beautiful game like the \u2018bubble perms from hell\u2019 that were regularly sported by Liverpool\u2019s late 1970s back-four and many other late 70s \u2018icons\u2019. We will also regularly explore the way in which many football fans such as writers such as Nick Hornby view the consumption of football and football culture as an intrinsic component of their identity. Similarly, we will investigate whether football culture may help to break-down divisions of class, gender and race. Throughout the semester we will do much reading and much writing about football culture. We will discuss football cuisine, football fashion, football literature, football songs, numerous football players you may have never heard of (Laurie Cunningham or Charlie George anyone?), and will regularly travel from the football present (Phil Foden, Jack Grealish, and Mo Salah) to the football past (Tommy Docherty and the legendary 1975 game between Fulham and Hereford United). We will familiarize ourselves with legendary football mantras as \u2018I\u2019m over the moon\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m sick as a parrot,\u2019 and we will become intimately familiar with the giants of British TV commentary such as Jimmy Hill (the man who invented \u20183 points for a win\u2019), Brian Moore, and John Motson. We will also explore a number of topics which capture students\u2019 interest over the course of the semester (and we will even play a few games if we can find a ball). Accordingly, you will have ample opportunity to help to shape the direction of class discussion and analysis. Ultimately, this is your seminar and am open to our jointly exploring any football topic which captures your imagination or interest.\n\nProfessor: Andrew Farrant\n\nTime: WF 11:30-12:45\n\n\n\n34. American Cool\n\n\n\nFrom beats to hipsters, politics to personal lives, punk to normcore, trendsetters to influencers \u2013 striving to be \u201ccool\u201d has long been part of American traditions. More than just describing the latest trend, \u201ccool\u201d is an elusive concept that communicates complex and ever-shifting tensions between gender and racial performance, popular- and counter-culture movements, emotional displays, generational shifts, and ideas around capitalism and consumerism. Using materials drawn from popular culture, history, politics, music, design, advertising, and language studies, we will explore the ways that gender, race, class, sexuality, ability, social values, and self-image have been historically understood, imagined, and communicated through a lens of \u201ccool\u201d in American culture. Through case studies on cool trends in 20th and 21st century American popular culture, we will complicate the distinctions of \u201ccool/not cool\u201d by placing trends in context with their historical moments, examining issues such as: power relationships involved in being cool (especially those related to inclusion/exclusion, participation, and control over trends); contemporary national/international events and conversations; coolness displayed as purchasable commodities; the power of groupthink and the pressures of conformity and individualism; and how we can understand determinations of \"cool/not cool\u201d as part of complex intersections of culture and power. Course requirements include active class participation, informal and formal writing and research assignments, class presentations, and an individual project exploring a cool trend of your choice.\n\nProfessor: Charity Fox\n\nTime: MF 11:30-12:45\n\n\n\n35. Villains Unveiled: The Narrative Journey of Literary and Cinematic Antagonists\n\n\n\nDive into the complex and compelling world of villains in literature and film in this first-year seminar course. Participants will explore the individual stories of iconic antagonists, dissecting how their experiences, motivations, and choices shape their journey within their respective narratives. From tragic backstories to morally ambiguous actions, students will unravel the layers of complexity that define these characters. Through in-depth discussions, character analyses, and creative exercises, students will explore the intricacies of the villain's stories.\n\nProfessor: Lauren Strunk\n\nTime: MWF 12:30-1:20\n\n\n\n36. The Search for Life in the Solar System and Beyond: What are we looking for, and what do we do if we find it?!?!?\n\n\n\nThe Ancient Greek philosopher, Epicurus, postulated that there is an infinite number of worlds in the Universe \u2013 some like this one, and others unlike it. In 1995 the first exoplanet was discovered and today there are more than 5,500 confirmed planets orbiting other stars within our Galaxy. In recent years, there have been a number of missions supported by NASA to explore planets and their satellites, asteroids, comets, and even Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs). This is in accord with one aspect of their visions for the Space Sciences program \u2013 to Search for Life Elsewhere. This search, however, depends greatly on what we know life to be: Earth and its inhabitants. If the requirements for life as we know it are liquid water, a source of energy, organic molecules, and biogenic elements such as carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, then NASA has already found multiple arenas in which \u201clife\u201d may reside. We will examine the role that NASA has played in the search for Life Elsewhere and explore the benefits of NASA\u2019s commercial partnerships program. We will examine the current protocols that are in place in case Life Elsewhere is detected and discuss the ramifications such a discovery would have on society. What would our ethical responsibility be to the \u201clife\u201d we discovered?\n\nProfessor: Catrina Hamilton-Drager\n\nTime: MF 11:30-12:45\n\n\n\n37. Video Explorations in Physics: Sharing the Beauty of Science with the World\n\n\n\nThe popularity of YouTube has ushered in a new generation of video content that focuses on some aspect of science and technology. A small percentage of these YouTube channels end up with millions of followers while the vast majority remain insignificant in comparison. But what makes one channel thrive while others languish? Is it the specific content, the personality of the creator, the quality of the presentation, of just plain luck? In short, what makes a video go viral and is it something that can be understood and recreated, or is it something intangible that depends serendipitously on a specific moment in the evolution of a society? In this seminar we will investigate these questions to try to understand what factors lead to YouTube fame and what implications this might have on society. As part of this journey, students will create their own video designed to share some beautiful aspect of science.\n\nProfessor: David Jackson\n\nTime: TR 9:00-10:15\n\n38. Bioethics and Bioissues\n\nIf you regularly watch CNN, read The New York Times, or use social media to follow the news, the prevalence of science in our society should not be surprising. However, while science is an essential part of our daily lives, inaccurate, incomplete, and/or biased communication of science often misleads the public. Furthermore, in the US there is a cultural challenge in that many people wish to benefit from science, but have little interest in trying to understand it, or even willingly ignore scientific data. (And to be fair, scientists often do a subpar job at communicating the importance of science to the public.) In this Seminar, we will work together to gain an informed understanding of several past and present ethical quandaries related to biology. Topics of discussion may include genetically modified organisms, vaccines and the anti-vax movement, human experimentation and eugenics, human gene therapy, euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide, and social and economic consequences of disease. Additional topics may be discussed as they arise. It is expected that you will be of open mind as you read, consider, discuss, and write about these multifaceted issues. Towards the end of the semester, via a small group project and presentation, you will apply and extend your enhanced understanding of concepts underlying these ethical issues to a topic of your choosing not otherwise discussed in the course.\n\n\n\nProfessor: David Kushner\n\nTime: MF 11:30-12:45\n\n39. Polyphemus to Pikachu: Making Sense of Monsters\n\nDragons, giants, zombies, vampires, extraterrestrials, cyborgs\u2014humans are fascinated by monsters, but what constitutes a \u201cmonster\u201d anyway? Where do monsters come from, and what does it mean to identify something, or someone, as a monster? And to what ends is the label \u201cmonster\u201d deployed? Although monsters can assume many different guises across cultures, they consistently occupy a space beyond established categories of \u201cnormalcy.\u201d Monsters subvert the sanctioned order of things, and this deviance gives rise to a contradiction: we fear monsters and view them as chaotic threats to be vanquished by a hero (much as the Greek hero Odysseus overcomes the man-eating cyclops Polyphemus in Homer\u2019s Odyssey), yet we also love monsters, and seek to understand and connect with them (Pok\u00e9mon, one of the most popular global media franchises in the world today, centers around collecting, befriending, and going on adventures with \u201cpocket monsters\u201d). This seminar explores how monsters give shape to human fears and desires through consideration of a broad selection of sources, both written and visual, fiction and nonfiction. Students will analyze these sources as a basis for exploring monsters as they appear across a range of cultural and historical contexts spanning from antiquity to the present.\n\nProfessor: \u00c1lvaro Pires\n\nTime: MWF 11:30-12:20\n\n40. Cancelled\n\n\n\n41. America in the Eyes of the World\n\n\n\nThe goal of this seminar is to examine the ways in which America (i.e. the United States) and Americans are viewed throughout the world. As a former director of the Dickinson program in Toulouse, France, I have come to realize that, although our students are linguistically and culturally prepared to go and study abroad, they often have little or no idea of how America is perceived by the rest of the world. This ignorance is sometimes the source of much frustration among our students. As citizens of the most powerful and influential country in the world, it is essential that American students become aware of how the United States affects other nations and how it is viewed by them. We are not alone in the world and, with the development of globalization and the internet, all nations are becoming increasingly interdependent in every area of human activity: business, trade, politics, security, education, medicine, protection of the environment, etc. Global problems require global solutions and we simply cannot afford to ignore the rest of the world. As denizens of the global village, we must find out and understand what others feel, believe, and need if we want to get along with them, cooperate with them, and live in peace and prosperity. World-awareness, however, will not be achieved in one class and one semester. My goal for this seminar is to initiate a learning process that will culminate during the students\u2019 semester or year abroad, and hopefully, continue throughout the rest of their lives. As Dickinson\u2019s mantra suggests, our vocation is to engage the world, and this seminar is the first step in that challenging and rewarding process. It is very likely that the students will read articles or editorials that are very critical of the United States which they will strongly disagree with. But this might arguably be the main lesson about academic learning: the ability to open one\u2019s mind to other points of view and respect them even if one completely disagrees with them. This is not an \u201cAmerica bashing\u201d class, nor is it a \u201cforeign countries bashing\u201d class. It is an attempt to understand others and discover the reasons for their opinion of the United States, as any global ambassador needs to.\n\n\n\nProfessor: Dominque Laurent\n\nTime: MW 11:30-12:45\n\n42. The Educational Conversation\n\nWhat does it mean to be an educated person? Is an educated person someone who is kind and compassionate? Able to think and speak for themselves? Someone who cares about their community and votes in every election? Able to identify the truth and right from wrong? For many students who arrive at Dickinson College, you have been embedded in schooling systems for most of your life, but might never have been asked these questions. What is or should be the purpose of school, and more broadly, of education? In this class, you will have the opportunity to reflect on and write your own educational autobiography, considering your most formative teachers or transformative moments that have shaped you into the person you are today. When we expand education beyond schooling as the process and project of shaping ourselves--who we are, our values and beliefs, what we do with our lives, and how we live with others, we recognize how some of our most important moments of self-formation occur outside of the classroom (e.g. on social media, in our home, on the soccer field, in the band practice room) and that some of what occurs in schools has little to do with education. Drawing on primary texts in the arts and humanities, we will examine a number of rich, rival conceptions of what it means to be an educated person and apply those ideas toward your own education--looking both retrospectively at your own educational history and prospectively about your unfolding Dickinson education. In this way, you will be invited to join one of the oldest and richest dialogues, the educational conversation.\n\nProfessor: Sam Ha DiMuzio\n\nTime: MW 11:30-12:45",

        "text": "Biden and Trump clinch 2024 presidential nominations, teeing up general election rematch\nPresident Biden and former President Donald Trump are barreling toward a November election rematch after their primary wins Tuesday night.\n\nCBS News estimates that Trump will be the presumptive 2024 Republican nominee after his win in Washington, amassing the 1,125 delegates needed to clinch the GOP nomination. He also won the day's Georgia and Mississippi primaries, CBS News projected.\n\nIn a video posted to social media by the Trump campaign, Trump called it a \"great day of victory,\" but said \"we're not going to take time to celebrate. We'll celebrate in eight months when the election is over.\"\n\nMr. Biden clinched the Democratic Party's nomination earlier Tuesday. He picked up wins in Washington, Georgia and Mississippi, CBS News projected.\n\nWith these wins, and the nominations settled, this will now be one of the longest general election campaigns in modern history. There are 238 days until Nov. 5, the day of the presidential election.\n\n\"Four years ago, I ran for president because I believed we were in a battle for the soul of this nation,\" Mr. Biden said in a statement released by his campaign Tuesday night. \"Because of the American people, we won that battle, and now I am honored that the broad coalition of voters representing the rich diversity of the Democratic Party across the country have put their faith in me once again to lead our party \u2014 and our country \u2014 in a moment when the threat Trump poses is greater than ever.\"\n\nTrump's path to the nomination\n\n\n\nIt's been an unconventional path to the nomination for Trump, who is the first former president in history to be indicted on criminal charges.\n\nTrump held a commanding lead in the polls over every primary challenger since launching his reelection campaign in November 2022. And those polls weren't even close: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis managed to come within a 15-point difference of Trump in a Fox News poll released in February 2023, long before DeSantis actually jumped into the race.\n\nThen Trump was indicted in four separate criminal proceedings \u2014 facing a total of 91 felony charges. With each indictment, Trump saw a boost in his primary poll numbers and was able to raise millions off of perceived efforts to unfairly target the former president.\n\nWith a larger war chest of cash and assertive lead in the polls, Trump was emboldened to ignore his primary rivals, declaring the primary over before it effectively started. He refused to participate in any of the debates sanctioned by the Republican National Committee or to sign a pledge to support the party's eventual nominee.\n\nTrump also rarely appeared on the campaign trail. The former president campaigned in Iowa only 26 times this cycle, compared to Gov. DeSantis who visited all 99 counties in the Hawkeye State.\n\nUltimately, Trump won the Iowa caucus by the largest margin of any Republican ever, crushing his rivals by winning 51% of Iowa caucus-goers.\n\nThe former president steamrolled through the early nominating contests, winning all but two of the primaries in his path. Former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, the last Republican to square off against Trump before dropping out the day after Super Tuesday, only won two GOP primaries, in Vermont and Washington, D.C.\n\nNow, Trump officially turns his focus to Mr. Biden, who defeated Trump in 2020 by flipping key battleground states Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Georgia and Arizona.\n\nPolling currently shows Trump leading Mr. Biden in a head-to-head matchup. A CBS News poll released earlier in March shows Trump with his largest lead yet, besting Mr. Biden 52% to 48% among likely voters.\n\nBiden's reelection campaign is underway\n\nClinching the Democratic nomination was more of a formality for Mr. Biden.\n\nThe incumbent president faced two longshot challengers in Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesota and author Marianne Williamson, but has overwhelmingly won every Democratic primary and caucus thus far (except for in American Samoa, where he split delegates with venture capitalist Jason Palmer, although Palmer won more of the 91 votes cast).\n\nA movement to vote \"uncommitted\" on some state ballots to protest Mr. Biden's response to the Israel-Hamas war has been the second top vote-getter in some states (Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, Hawaii), though with a wide gap between the president and this option.\n\nMr. Biden's path to 1,968 delegates also began with an adjusted calendar he pushed for in 2022 \u2013 with South Carolina taking the first slot followed by Nevada and Michigan.\n\nWith its \"first in the nation\" law, New Hampshire was technically the first state to hold a Democratic nominating contest. While the president's name was not on the ballot and no delegates were awarded, due to the state breaking the DNC's new rules, Mr. Biden won anyway with a write-in vote.\n\nFollowing his State of the Union address last Thursday, the president and his campaign have shifted into full general election mode.\n\nHe has ramped up his battleground state travel, with trips to Pennsylvania, Georgia, Wisconsin and Michigan slated so far this month. Vice President Kamala Harris was in Arizona and Nevada over the weekend.\n\nThe campaign announced a $30 million ad buy over the next six weeks, with the first ad looking to tackle concerns about the president's age, 81. The campaign has a goal of opening 100 new offices across the battleground states and adding 350 new staffers this month.\n\nUnderscoring the campaign's pivot to the general election mode is a severe cash advantage for Mr. Biden, with over $130 million cash on hand according to campaign finance records in combination with the DNC, nearly doubling Mr. Trump's war chest.\n\nBut the incumbent president is still stuck in a tight battle with his 2020 opponent according to national and battleground state polling \u2014 in part due to waning enthusiasm from his winning Democratic coalition in 2020.\n\nMr. Biden has already started putting his contrasts with Trump front and center in his campaign. He referred frequently to \"my predecessor\" in his State of the Union address and has continued his criticism of Trump on the campaign trail.\n\n\"Donald Trump has a different constituency. Here's the guy who's kicking off his general election campaign in the road up with Marjorie Taylor Greene. It can tell you a lot about a person who he keeps company with,\" Mr. Biden said during a campaign event in Atlanta on Saturday.",

        "text": "Political Violence in Mexico's 2024 Elections: Organized Crime Involvement\nDOWNLOAD THE ARTICLE HERE\n\nWhen it comes to an understanding of political violence in Mexico, there is a risk of solely equating it with criminal groups' activities or exclusively attributing it to such groups. However, the political violence phenomenon in Mexico is complex and diverse, with a particular nexus to locally based illicit economies, for which an all-containing approach is insufficient.\n\nAbout half of the political violence that occurred in Mexico during the 2018 elections was directly attributed to organized crime. During such time, political figures were killed at a rate of one per week.\n\nThese numbers support the growing concern about criminal groups' involvement in Mexican politics. Criminal groups have used political violence in several ways: directly manipulating and influencing elections, protecting incumbent candidates with whom they have struck an agreement, killing candidates who are perceived as a threat to their interests, intimidating poll workers, and attacking and stealing voting booths, among others.\n\nThe decrease in the profitability of trafficking heroin and cannabis, the legalization of marijuana in many US states, and increased fentanyl usage have forced cartels to recalibrate strategies and markets. Nowadays, criminal groups have partially shifted towards locally based illicit economies, such as oil theft, extortion, kidnapping, and other illegal activities that require control of local territories. All these variables come into play when understanding that criminalized electoral politics is a predominantly local phenomenon in Mexico.\n\nPolitical violence by criminal groups in Mexico is motivated by multiple factors, including economic interests, political objectives, and vendettas. Criminal organizations often avoid open confrontation when attacking politicians or political candidates, opting for other less visible techniques to minimize the impacts on police and law enforcement agencies, such as corruption.\n\nInstalling or co-opting candidates at the municipal level has afforded criminal groups direct influence over the actions of local and state police. Access to intelligence on pending arrests or other operations has also proven beneficial for criminal organizations. Political influence has allowed criminal groups to employ local security forces as appendages of their organizations to detain or kill targets and to protect the transportation of illicit goods. Moreover, criminal organizations have tapped into state finances by coopting government employees.\n\nCriminal groups demand that \u201cinvestments\u201d in electoral campaigns bestow advantages over competitors or, more clearly, demarcate lines of territorial control. Problems arise when their demands are unmet. There are \u201cparadise municipalities,\u201d which are pacts that work with almost no violence and resistance from the government. However, they are scarce. In some cases, state governors and local politicians prefer to \u201cdouble-sell the plaza\u201d to several competing criminal groups, perpetuating highly volatile state-criminal arrangements. It is widely known that many politicians' promises are never kept, which, in turn, sparks new waves of violence. In this scenario, criminal groups have turned to direct attacks on politicians, candidates, and police officers. Demonstrations such as burning vehicles and blocking roads or public messages and videos have been employed to inflict reputational damage by attracting harmful press coverage.\n\nTherefore, it is understood that access to the Mexican state is crucial for criminal groups\u2019 survival and expansion. It is generally accepted that only illegal groups with state protection grow. The need for such protection translates into criminal groups threatening competitors\u2019 allies and sabotaging possible arrangements with politicians. There is a particular inclination to do so around elections when new pacts are brokered. In this regard, cartels are forced to change the electoral balance to capture state agents and gain an advantage to control territories and markets.\n\nMexican politicians or political candidates are identified as rivals when they don't cooperate with organized criminal groups, which then are targeted by way of threats or, in extreme cases, murder. Murders have a particular effect since they send a potent message to political opponents and civil society. There have even been cases of local politicians being killed even hours or days after taking office. Another way, generally unidentified, of pressuring \u201cuncooperative\u201d politicians is through violence to instill fear among voters and in turn, affect voter turnout.\n\nAn additional concern is the rapidly increasing involvement of criminal groups in election finances through illicit campaign funding. In Mexico, campaign budgets come along with statutory caps, with an average amount from public and private sources of 333,921 pesos (about 16,650 USD) for municipalities in the 2021 election. Not surprisingly, local candidates view the budget amounts as insufficient, and accepting illegal funding sources from criminal groups hasn\u00b4t been uncommon; some campaigns have spent as much as 20 million pesos (500,000 USD).\n\nOn the other side, criminal organizations strike local authorities to obtain access to public funds, which they later use to strengthen their territorial presence. This phenomenon, known as the \u201crent capture strategy,\u201d only functions when the number of resources they can extract exceeds the costs of corrupting public authorities.\n\nWhen criminal organizations manage to capture local elections effectively, they reap multiple benefits, such as accessibility for transporting illegal drugs, fewer obstacles to money laundering, intelligence gathering, protection from the local police, non-interference in their activities, and even support from the police to combat rival groups. Electoral cycles stimulate violence because it is easier to capture candidates seeking power than sitting politicians who tend to have more extensive state protection.\n\nMexican cartels see local electoral cycles as an opportunity to attack vulnerable candidates to build subnational criminal governance control, later granting them decision-making influence. As elections threaten the relationships established with politicians and a change in the political status quo, criminal groups continually seek to protect existing political relationships and form new ones.\n\nElectoral local dynamics and the consequent risk for criminal groups\u00b4 intervention are not homogenous throughout Mexico\u00b4s 32 states. Integralia\u2019s risk assessment divides the risk of organized crime intervention in the 2024 local elections into six risk categories: Very High, High, Medium, Low, and Very Low. The states with the highest risk of intervention have i) accumulation of illicit markets, ii) criminal groups in armed conflict, iii) weak rule of law, iv) municipal elections, and v) municipalities considered important to criminal groups.\n\nImage Credit Integralia Consultores\n\nRegarding the influence of organized crime at the national level, while experts identify the Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generaci\u00f3n (CJNG) and the Sinaloa Cartel as the main actors with a presence in multiple states, crime dynamics vary by region.\n\nCriminal groups' involvement in politics risks further aggravating the dissimilarities and volatility of dangerous states, creating contrasting realities for Mexicans who are experiencing high levels of crime and violence and, in some cases, polarizing displacements due to criminal groups.\n\nThe influence of organized crime in Mexican politics poses an imminent and severe threat to the nation's democratic integrity and stability. The convergence of criminal groups with political structures jeopardizes the fundamental principles of governance, fostering an environment where criminal interests supersede the welfare of citizens. The intertwining of criminal groups and politics compromises the rule of law and undermines the credibility of democratic institutions. This perilous alliance amplifies corruption, perpetuates violence, and erodes public trust, hindering the country's potential for sustainable development.\n\nThe dangerous nexus between organized crime and politics demands decisive and vigilant counteraction to safeguard the citizens\u00b4 well-being, the democratic fabric of Mexico, and the already declining interest in defending such a system",

        "text": "Biden, Trump likely to clinch nomination after Republican and Democratic primaries in Washington, Georgia, Mississippi\nPresident Biden and former President Donald Trump were both on track to clinch their respective party's nominations Tuesday night, as several states held nominating contests. Republicans in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington held primaries Tuesday, and Hawaii is holding GOP caucuses this evening. Democrats also held primaries in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington, as well as the northern Mariana Islands, and Democrats abroad are voting.\n\nPresident Biden clinched the Democratic nomination Tuesday, CBS News estimated, after his projected victory in the Georgia primary Tuesday. Trump, too, was projected to win Georgia, and both were also projected to win Mississippi soon after polls closed there.\n\nHere are the results of the contests so far:\n\nTrump's remaining major rival, former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, dropped her White House bid after the Super Tuesday primaries, and Mr. Biden does not have any major challengers.\n\nTrump dominated the Republican field without ever debating any of his primary opponents, and has dominated the early state nominating contests.\n\nThe former president is also entering the general election phase of the presidential campaign facing 91 felony charges in four criminal cases. His first criminal trial is slated to begin on March 25 in New York, where he faces 34 charges connected to alleged \"hush money\" payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels during the 2016 presidential election. Trump also faces state criminal charges in Georgia for alleged interference in the 2020 presidential election, as well as federal charges in Washington, D.C. He is also facing federal charges in Florida over his handling of classified documents after his presidency.\n\nIn the four contests Tuesday, 161 GOP delegates are at stake, and Trump is closing in on the 1,215 delegates needed to secure the nomination. There were 254 Democratic delegates up for grabs in the March 12 contests.\n\nTrump would be the first Republican in history ever to secure the presidential nomination three straight times. Richard Nixon won the GOP nomination three times, although not in consecutive cycles.\n\nFor Republicans, in Georgia, 59 delegates were on at stake, with 40 more in Mississippi, 43 in Washington and 19 in the Hawaii caucuses.\n\nWhen are polls closing for today's GOP primaries?\n\nGeorgia\n\nPolls opened at 7 a.m. and closed at 7 p.m., but any voter in line at 7 p.m. was able to cast a ballot, according to state rules.\n\nMississippi\n\nPolls opened at 7 a.m. CT (8 a.m. ET) and closed at 7 p.m. CT (8 p.m. ET) but as in Georgia, any voter in line at 7 p.m. was able to cast a ballot.\n\nWashington\n\nWashington is a mail-in voting state, but voters are also able to cast ballots on Tuesday. Polls close at 8 p.m. PT (11 p.m. ET).\n\nHawaii\n\nHawaii GOP caucus goers will go to their caucuses from 6 p.m to 8 p.m. local time (12 a.m. to 2 a.m. ET).\n\nWhen do polls close in the Democratic contests?\n\nGeorgia\n\nPolls opened at 7 a.m. and closed at 7 p.m., but any voter who was in line at 7 p.m. was able to cast a ballot, according to state rules.\n\nMississippi\n\nPolls opened at 7 a.m. CT (8 a.m. ET) and closed at 7 p.m. CT (8 p.m. ET) but as in Georgia, any voter in line at 7 p.m. was able to cast a ballot.\n\nWashington\n\nWashington is a mail-in voting state, but voters may also cast ballots on Tuesday. Polls close at 8 p.m. PT (11 p.m. ET).\n\nNorthern Mariana Islands\n\nThe Democratic party of the Northern Mariana Islands held their primaries from March 5-12. Polls closed at 4 a.m. ET.\n\nDemocrats abroad\n\nDemocrats Abroad can vote in person or submit their ballots by email, fax or postal mail. Polls close at 3 a.m. ET and results are expected on March 19.\n\nBiden estimated to secure the nomination\n\nWith the results from the Northern Mariana Islands and Georgia, Mr. Biden is estimated to have secured 1,968 delegates he needed to clinch the Democratic nomination.\n\nKabir Khanna contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Russia claims US and 'Western countries' are trying to hack its presidential election\nAs Russia prepares for its presidential election this week, its systems are reportedly being targeted by \u201cmassive\u201d cyberattacks, according to local authorities.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin is running against three \u201cofficially permitted\u201d opponents in the election scheduled to take place from March 15 to 17. It will be Russia's first-ever three-day-long presidential election and the first instance when residents from certain regions, including Moscow, can cast their votes online.\n\nLast week, a Russian state official from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that hackers from \u201cWestern countries\u201d are plotting and already orchestrating cyberattacks on Russian election infrastructure.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good that our electoral system turned out to be resistant to external cyber influence, but this is also an indicator of how great the pressure of enemies is on the Russian state,\u201d said the ministry\u2019s ambassador-at-large Gennady Askaldovich.\n\nThe head of the Russian election commission, Ella Pamfilova, also stated last week that Russian \"enemies\" are attempting to meddle in the presidential elections in the country \"to such an extent as never before.\"\n\n\u201cThe Russian electoral system today is experiencing unprecedented attempts at interference; the hacker attacks are ongoing; the purpose of all this is to disrupt the presidential election,\u201d she added.\n\nPamfilova said that due to cyberattacks on the election commission\u2019s services and websites, electronic voting is allowed only in those regions where \"its security is guaranteed.\u201d\n\nNeither Askaldovich nor Pamfilova provided any evidence for alleged election-related cyberattacks. The Kremlin, which conducted an extensive interference operation targeting the 2016 U.S. presidential election, has a history of making baseless accusations to satisfy its own political goals.\n\nThe Russian National Computer Incident Coordination Center (CERT) has also issued a warning to online voters about the escalating cyber threats, including those that could originate from Ukraine and its allied countries. According to the CERT statement, cybercriminals will try to discredit the election, stir up social tension, spread fake news and infect online voters with malware.\n\nThe agency has advised its users to be cautious of phishing websites posing as electronic voting services. They also warned against emails and messages containing malicious links, disguised as official correspondence from Russian state agencies.\n\nThis week, Russia's foreign intelligence service specifically accused the U.S. of attempting to interfere in Russia's election and launching a cyberattack on its online voting system. The White House denied this statement.\n\n\u201cThese allegations are categorically false and nothing more than propaganda,\" a White House National Security Council spokesperson told Reuters. \"The U.S. has not and will not meddle in Russia\u2019s election. It is Russia that has a long history of targeting U.S. and other democratic elections.\u201d\n\nLast week, the Kremlin said that Russia will not meddle in the upcoming U.S. presidential election in November, and dismissed the findings that Moscow was behind the campaigns to interfere in both the 2016 and 2020 U.S. presidential elections.\n\nSo far, there have been no public cases of Russian state websites going down, and none of the prominent Ukrainian hacktivist groups have claimed responsibility for such attacks.\n\nOn Monday, the Russian independent media organization Meduza said that it has been targeted by an \u201cunprecedented\u201d cyber campaign ahead of the upcoming presidential election.\n\nLocal independent media are also warning of possible internet or social media outages during the election period. This is a common practice in authoritarian countries and was recently used during Pakistan\u2019s elections.\n\nThe reports of internet outages in Russia have become more frequent recently, with some appearing to be politically motivated.\n\nThe Kremlin is also trying to prevent its opponents from speaking up against Putin. For example, Russia banned the publication of polls, forecasts, and studies related to the presidential elections.\n\nSupporters of the killed opposition leader Alexey Navalny also reported receiving fake messages, stating that the protests they are planning to organize on election day have been postponed.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be fooled by fakes! They are trying to deceive you! Come to the polling stations on March 17 at 12:00 local time and vote against Putin,\u201d Navalny\u2019s team said.",

        "text": "Political Violence in Mexico's 2024 Elections: Gender-Based Political Violence Against Women\nREAD THE FULL ARTICLE HERE\n\nIntroduction\n\nOver the last twenty years, the world has witnessed significant shifts towards greater gender equality in politics, which in turn has had positive implications for democracy and society at large.\n\nMexico has witnessed a systematic incorporation of gender perspective, equality, and parity in public life, signifying a transformation of women's ability to participate in the country's future. The prime example is the National Electoral Institute (INE) mandate, later ratified by the Electoral Tribunal (TEPJF), for political parties to guarantee gender parity in all upcoming gubernatorial elections of 2024: Chiapas, Guanajuato, Jalisco, Morelos, Puebla, Tabasco, Veracruz, Yucat\u00e1n, and Mexico City.\n\nUnfortunately, as women's participation in politics rises, an increase in political violence that explicitly targets women has also occurred. The 2020-2021 electoral process was the most violent against Mexican women.\n\nMexico\u00b4s political system is awash with political violence that explicitly targets and affects women, obstructs social justice, and hinders democracy. The advances in female political participation have been met with resistance as men, territorial interest groups, and political elites seemingly feel threatened by increasing female power and respond with violent actions to uphold the traditional system of politics to deter women\u2019s independent participation.\n\nGender-Based Political Violence Against Women (GBPVAW) encompasses behaviors that specifically target women because of their gender. When female politicians are attacked for their political views alone, this is not a case of GBPVAW but of political disagreement or another type of political violence. Examples include violence targeted at political campaigns or voting rights, restricting registration as a political candidate, digital violence, sexual violence, physical violence (beating, pushing, molestation, kidnapping, murder), as well as economic and psychological violence, such as harassment, verbal abuse, defamation, and threats against female politician\u00b4s and their families.\n\nGBPVAW\u2019s end goal is to pressure, hinder, punish, or deprive women of their right to participate in politics. This type of violence takes on additional significance as a form of gender role enforcement, where the coercer tries to dominate and control women, limit opportunities, and curtail their political rights. This type of violence can affect the whole exercise of politics and the decision-making of women in political positions. Political violence is not exclusive to female politicians since it can bedirected at candidates, voters, campaign staff, and activists during and after electoral campaigns.",

        "text": "Trump Disqualification Tracker\nAlmost immediately after Jan. 6, 2021, legal commentators began debating whether Section 3 of the 14th Amendment would disqualify former President Donald Trump from running in the 2024 presidential election. They debated whether or not Section 3 applies to a former president, whether it is self-executing, and whether Jan. 6 could be considered an insurrection or rebellion.\n\nSince then, the issue became less abstract, though no less contentious. In February 2021, the U.S. Senate acquitted Trump of an impeachment article for inciting insurrection, but with a bipartisan majority of the Senate voting to convict. Section 3 challenges have been mounted against several legislators, and one state-level county commissioner who participated in the attack was successfully ousted from his post under that provision. At the end of 2022, the House Select Committee on the Jan. 6 Attack on the Capitol made the argument that Trump did inspire an insurrection, referring him to the Justice Department for prosecution under multiple criminal statutes, including one prohibiting insurrection. The Special Counsel\u2019s Office has since brought a criminal case in Washington, D.C. charging Trump for his role in the Jan. 6 attack. And some prominent legal conservatives made the case for a strong, originalist reading of Section 3 that they argue would apply to Trump, immediately disqualifying him from office.\n\nBeginning in winter 2023, voters and advocacy groups have brought Section 3 challenges in courts across the country, attempting to block Trump\u2019s name from appearing on ballots for state primaries and caucuses before the general election begins, as Lawfare tracked and represented in the above map and table below. After Colorado became the first state in the nation to take Trump off its presidential primary ballot in Anderson et. al v. Griswold, the question reached the Supreme Court in Trump\u2019s appeal of the decision in Trump v. Anderson (the docket for which Lawfare tracked and remains below). After hearing oral argument on Feb. 8, the Supreme Court ruled on March 4 that Trump could not be disqualified from Colorado\u2019s presidential primary ballot under Section 3 without Congressional action. (Read Lawfare\u2019s analysis on the decision.) That decision has effectively ended the array of challenges to Trump\u2019s ballot eligibility.\n\nBelow you will find Lawfare\u2019s past and continuing coverage of the legal and policy implications surrounding Trump Section 3 challenges, and primary source documents, analysis, and resources.\n\nThe Trump Disqualification Tracker was created by Hyemin Han with Caleb Benjamin on Oct. 30, 2023. The litigation tracker portion of the project was last updated and edited by Han, Anna Bower, Matt Gluck, Tyler McBrien, and Roger Parloff on March 4, 2024.",

        "text": "New online tool for the 2024 European Parliament elections developed by the EUI\nCome elections, do you read the programme put forth by the candidate that you decide to vote for? Or do you rather trust your instinct and hope that the party you have a preference for matches your political views?\n\nVoting Advice Applications (so-called VAAs) offer excellent help in doing your \u2018homework\u2019 before elections. Called also \u2018political compass\u2019, \u2018electoral navigator\u2019 or \u2018party-meter\u2019, they are online tools that help users make a choice in a given election.\n\nIn the run-up to the 2024 European Parliament elections, the EUI is working on the release of a European VAA, called EU&I. Today, the project, led by Research Fellow Lorenzo Cicchi, is launching its website which will serve as a hub for useful and engaging content before the actual app is launched on Europe Day, 9 May.\n\nAvailable in over 20 languages, the tool invites users to react to 30 policy statements covering a wide range of contemporary policy issues and political values in European politics such as migration, government spending, green taxes, security and more. It then uses a mathematical algorithm to find which parties stand closest to citizens' preferences on these issues, both in their country and all across Europe.\n\nEU&I uses a sound scientific methodology to analyse and code more than 250 parties participating in the upcoming elections. In the weeks leading up to the 2024 vote, a team of 130 scholars across Europe is meticulously researching party positions and official documentation to position the candidates according to the 30 statements in the questionnaire. To ensure the precision, the online tool will be launched a month before the elections, when all parties will have already announced their positions.\n\nThe EUI has been at the forefront of VAAs for the European elections. In 2009, EU Profiler was created: the very first transnational VAA for European elections. The initiative came from Alexander H. Trechsel, at the time director of the European Democracy Observatory (EUDO, the predecessor of EGPP) and with the strong support of the late Peter Mair. The project, under the new name of EU&I, continued in 2014 and 2019 when the record number of 1.28 million users was reached.\n\nLearn more about this initiative of the European Governance and Politics Programme of the Robert Schuman Centre on its website.\n\n\n\nStay tuned and follow the project's social media channels on X, LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram and Bluesky.",

But this year a group of analysts surveyed by CFR have sounded the biggest alarm about something bubbling up at home - political violence around this year\u2019s presidential election. They have also flagged the prospects of a surge in migration at the southwest U.S. border as a leading concern. And while both are scenarios playing out, rather unusually, on U.S. soil, they have consequences for the rest of the world.\n\nTo help sort through these and other worries, we turn to Paul Stares. Paul is a CFR senior fellow and director of the Center for Preventive Action, which runs a yearly survey of global threats and priorities.\n\nI\u2019m Gabrielle Sierra and this is Why It Matters. Today, what to worry about in 2024.\n\nGabrielle SIERRA: So Paul, this isn\u2019t the first time that we\u2019ve had you on Why It Matters, you joined us last year to go over the top threats for 2023. But new year, new threats, so let\u2019s kick it off. What are the top concerns for 2024?\n\nPaul B. STARES: So In terms of the top priorities this year or risks, the first is the likelihood of growing political polarization in the United States, which leads to potential acts of domestic terrorism, political violence, particularly around the upcoming presidential election. The second concern was an expansion or escalation of the ongoing conflict in Gaza between Israel and Hamas. And the third ranked concern this year is the surge in immigration toward the southwest border of the United States. And some are already moving in the direction of what people were concerned or anticipated at the end of 2023.\n\nThese top priorities are all high impact, high probability contingencies - and having three of them on the report in one year is unprecedented. So let's go through them one at a time, beginning with domestic terrorism and political violence here in the United States.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/lfP_5L8epow?si=o1NE2ArcHY-bwVC-&t=37\n\nVICE News: Stop protecting tyrants\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0\n\nMSNBC: We turn now to the 2024 presidential race\n\nhttps://youtu.be/CrazBhHlFyM?si=NhoXSz7DZ58flIKH&t=244\n\nPBS NewsHour: You mention the issue of political violence, the language is careless.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/EN1TxijCEX0?si=2aVMt9Nug6-nc3pV&t=80\n\nTODAY: If you don\u2019t fight like hell, you\u2019re not going to have a country anymore.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/KCbTgDC14uY?si=8w-QjKu6GXcD1bGl&t=60\n\nThe Independent: I\u2019m telling you, if Pence caved, we\u2019re going to drag [expletive] through the streets. [expletive] politicians are going to get dragged through the streets.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/dIKg_rDBSYk?si=GI02MhtTmmV5yKwA\n\nTimes Radio: You know the risk of something much much worse than January the 6 I think is quite high.\n\nSIERRA: Yikes.\n\nSTARES: Yikes, indeed. So this is the first year that we have included a domestic conflict related contingency. Prior years we've only ever included foreign threats or overseas or foreign-sourced concerns. But when we did the solicitation of what to include, it was the overwhelming top concern in this year's preventive priorities survey.\n\nSIERRA: I mean it must have been really top of mind if domestic issues rarely make the list.\n\nSTARES: I think just the level of polarization over the last four or five years has definitely increased in the United States. Obviously January 6th is in people's minds, the storming of the Capitol in 2020. And a lot of people worry about how this growing polarization could really lead to acts of political violence. And here I'm talking about potential assassination of candidates, possible terrorist acts at the conventions, disruption of the voting procedures, possibly again a sort of January 6th-like disruption of the counting and then the actual outcome being properly accredited at the end of this whole process. So this could go on throughout essentially 2024, well into 2025.\n\nSIERRA: So what can we do about it?\n\nSTARES: We could try to reduce the risk of candidates, if not deliberately then inadvertently, inciting their supporters to engage in violence. We can take extra security precautions around known events, the primaries obviously, and beef up the security for the candidates, beef up the security around events like the conventions, polling stations and so on.\n\nSIERRA: We see how big of a deal this is for us, but a domestic issue is at home, so why should anyone outside of the U.S. even care about this?\n\nSTARES: I think it's worth taking a time out just to think about what are the foreign policy implications of growing political violence or polarization in the U.S.? And I think you can imagine there are several concerns in the minds of foreign policy experts. Obviously they're concerned about the threat to life and liberty at home, but I think they're probably also worried that foreign actors, foreign adversaries could try to foment more divisions, more divisiveness within the U.S. and through disinformation, social media, fake news, they could sort of whip up even further unrest and potential violence in the U.S. I think another concern is that if this were to happen, the U.S. could be just distracted by this. And other actors might take advantage who see the U.S. just got their hands full at home, and so they do things abroad again against U.S. interests. Another probable concern is for many years, the U.S. has been a big promoter of democracy and human rights around the world. We've advocated for peaceful elections and the orderly transfer of power, and it's going to be damn hard for the U.S. to advocate for all those things if we essentially can't keep the peace at home. And so as I've argued in many respects, conflict prevention is now going to have to begin at home if we want to try to be effective abroad.\n\nSIERRA: Yeah. Like how can we set an example, how could we tell people how to run their country -\n\nSTARES: Precisely. We've been doing this for years. We've encouraged international organizations to develop handbooks to manage elections, and when we can't sort of do it in a peaceful, orderly process, it really undercuts the credibility of the message, frankly.\n\nSidenote, if you are interested in diving further into how we got into this phase in the first place, there is a great book out by two of my CFR colleagues, Jacob Ware and Bruce Hoffman. It\u2019s called God, Guns, and Sedition: Far Right Terrorism in America. Yes the title promises a lot and the book delivers. You should check it out.\n\nSIERRA: I get that this is very very scary and it\u2019s something we need to prevent, but I do still wonder how foreign policy experts compared something like this to the great power threats on the list?\n\nSTARES: It's really hard. Obviously, I don't think one can compare acts of terrorism at home, certainly if it's relatively low level or random, and it's contained afterwards with the possibility of escalation between the U.S. and China over Taiwan, which could conceivably lead to major power conflict and even the use of nuclear weapons. They're two quite different possibilities. But for the U.S. to be distracted at this time for there to be major sort of violent divisions within the U.S., this could kind of resonate in extremely unwelcome ways around the world. So I don't want to underestimate or underrate the risk that comes from domestic terrorism and political violence in the U.S. because it really is a serious threat.\n\nAnd so foreign policy experts think one of the biggest threats in the year ahead is actually at home.\n\nLet\u2019s move on to the next of the top three threats, the escalation of war in the Middle East.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fg_pPmNrVYU\n\nPBS NewsHour: The U.S. priority since the October 7 Hamas terrorist attack has been preventing violence from expanding across the region.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0\n\nCNN: New strikes on Iranian backed militants far from Israel's borders, stoking fears that the United States is on the brink of a wider war in the Middle East.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cXvgmzc88s\n\nWGN News: President Biden is vowing to respond after an Iranian-backed drone strike.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/_cXvgmzc88s?si=RdqZUThkH5t5UyLr&t=29\n\nWGN News: Three American troops killed and at least thirty-four more injured today.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/i9mWAshwvSE?si=Us8r-qDh8EZhkB67&t=155\n\nTODAY: Today in this region, U.S. allies from Bahrain to Egypt are warning of further instability while condemning what they're calling a terrorist attack.\n\nSIERRA: Can you explain a bit more about this idea of wider regional conflict?\n\nSTARES: Yeah, so when the survey was sent out back in November, the war between Israel and Hamas was pretty much contained to Gaza. And since late November of 2023, we've seen there's definitely been an escalation, most notably by the Houthis in Yemen attacking ships in international waters, the U.S. countering that with multiple rounds of strikes against the Houthis. The Houthis have long-range missiles that cannot only attack shipping but could even potentially reach Israel, I believe. And I think there was a case early in the conflict in which one such missile was intercepted by Israel. So there's that dimension. There is the possibility of Hezbollah, which is an Islamist militant group backed by Iran, conducting attacks across the border from Lebanon into Israel and Israel striking back. And we've seen since November, that has started to occur and there's been an uptick in violence there. We've also seen Israeli forces attacking targets in Syria, which are believed to be against Iran-backed militant groups there. There's been no direct attack on Iran so much, but we've seen Iran striking what they think are Israeli targets in northern Iraq. We've seen an uptick in Iranian-backed militants attacking U.S. forces in Syria and Iraq and the U.S. retaliating. And perhaps most surprising of all, we saw Iran striking targets in Pakistan and Pakistan striking back against targets in Iran. And so any one of these four or five, if you will, vectors or trajectories of potential escalation could definitely get worse in the coming months. And it's not hard to see how what was previously a relatively contained conflict becomes a much wider regional conflagration.\n\nSIERRA: The PPS report lists threats in relation to the United States. The Middle East is about 7,000 miles away, right. But sometimes what happens there hits close to home. In January, an Iran-backed group killed three Americans at a military base in Jordan. So, in what other ways might this directly affect the United States?\n\nSTARES: In several ways. One is it's distracted the U.S. in its support for Ukraine against Russia. There's not only the attention that policymakers can give to countries that are under attack, but the level of support: military, diplomatic is also affected. And I think the U.S. has become increasingly distracted by trying to tamp down the possibility of escalation. They've deployed carrier battle groups to the Eastern Mediterranean. As I say, they've already ramped up some strikes against threats to their forces in Syria and Iraq. So it's a big distraction there. There's always the possibility that the war will resonate domestically. We've seen some extent in terms of level of protests in the U.S. against Israeli actions in Gaza, and that's a source of concern and can become a kind of issue in the presidential campaign. It's a source of tension with allies too. Several U.S. allies have been quite critical of Israeli actions in Gaza. And so that becomes a tension there. Again an unwelcome development at this time.\n\nSIERRA: What steps could help avoid the worst outcomes for an escalating Israeli-Palestinian conflict?\n\nSTARES: Well, definitely you have to think about this in all its dimensions. There's obviously the efforts to try to deter further escalation militarily by either the Houthis, and we're seeing that trying to degrade the Houthis capacity to attack shipping. We've seen U.S. military force being used as a warning to Iran to again try to control their proxy forces in Lebanon and Iraq. So there's the military dimension. There's the diplomatic angle too, and you've seen U.S. officials going to the region on a regular basis trying to broker a ceasefire in Gaza, engaging with Gulf countries and Egypt to try to sort of bring the fighting to an end, to see the hostages released from Hamas. And you've seen efforts also to try to stabilize international markets so they're not roiled in a really destabilizing way by the conflict there. So there are multiple ways we can try to contain this, to deescalate, look for off ramps, try to encourage some of the key countries involved here to show restraint and look for a diplomatic solution rather than escalate in a really harmful way.\n\nMoving on to big threat number three and bringing it back home: a migration crisis on the southwest U.S. border.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/-LjY1nE_cCA?si=MomNW1gGyvD0tXUw&t=1\n\nTODAY: The crisis at the border? Unrelenting with thousands arriving daily from California to Arizona and Texas.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/yZAH4uIXLp8?si=49v6DzP-3X1uLcYn&t=15\n\nNBC News: Tonight, customs and border protection overwhelmed by an unprecedented number of migrants crossing the southern border.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/QGvsJ5w7vzo?si=mad9u03tLr1F-j-D&t=27\n\nFOX 26 Houston: Many lawmakers are now calling it a war against fentanyl, and they believe it starts right here at the border impacting families hundreds of miles away.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/DdlipIbsq4A?si=Mv83wehibdzOJtp5&t=2\n\nABC News: President Biden and Donald Trump both there late today, just demonstrating how significant this issue is with the presidential election this November.\n\nSTARES: Throughout 2023, we saw a substantial increase in the number of migrants reaching the southern border of the U.S. Reports that as many as 2.3-2.4 million migrants arrived in the U.S. in an unregulated fashion in 2023. The end of the year, something like 10,000 were crossing the border every day. It's an extraordinary number. They were coming from a lot of different places: obviously Central America and Mexico. A lot of it's driven by economic hardship there, political corruption, criminal violence, but also from beyond Central America and Mexico. A lot of them were coming through the Dari\u00e9n Gap, this part of the Central American Isthmus, from Venezuela, where the situation remains pretty dire there. Ecuador, where there's been a lot of instability in recent months because of criminal violence. Haiti is another source of a lot of migrants. And so these have been surging through Mexico onto the southwest border. What I understand is that since early January 2024, things have declined a little bit, but probably still around 2-3000 a day, which is still an awful lot of people. It's become a major political football if you will. Republicans are holding up support for Ukraine and Israel until the administration adopts certain measures to strengthen, harden the border. And that problem has not yet been resolved. So there's a lot of angles here that I think people are worried about.\n\nMuch like the first threat on our list, this one takes place here at home, but it isn\u2019t as cut and dry to understand. The migration crisis encompasses a complex number of threats, which, taken together, are potentially highly destabilizing.\n\nAccording to foreign policy experts, these threats include the vast suffering of the migrants themselves, deepening instability in source countries, the potential for deadly drugs to slip through the border, and a rapidly escalating border crisis that could involve the U.S. military - all of which cultivate a deepening of the intense political divisiveness we have seen emerge in the U.S. surrounding immigration.\n\nSIERRA: How could this pose a security threat to the United States? What separates it from like a traditional immigration issue?\n\nSTARES: I like to say that migration, per se, should not be considered a national security threat. I think unregulated borders, open borders, can be definitely considered a security concern if you don't know who's coming across. The influx of fentanyl, that's been a big concern. It's causing a lot of deaths in the U.S. So there's definitely that angle. I think it's broadly this concern that it's hard to just assimilate a lot of people all at once. And that creates sort of societal stresses, resentment amongst locals, it burdens social security networks and so on, and health facilities. And overall, that is probably, I think the biggest concern here rather than a kind of traditional national security threat.\n\nSIERRA: It seems like this problem is causing a lot of debate both in D.C. and in our own neighborhoods at home, right. It seems like a really hard problem to fix, so can we do anything about it?\n\nSTARES: You know there's the immediate effort to try to reduce the places along the border where immigrants are coming in a completely unregulated, sometimes in an unsafe way. Sometimes migrants die getting across the border and you obviously want to reduce that happening. So efforts to try to, if you will, harden the border, increase the level of law enforcement so that you're not overwhelmed in any one place. I think the effort that the Biden administration has been trying to focus on in recent months is more sort of upstream efforts to try to encourage the transit countries to dissuade migrants to improve their border security so that they are not becoming a magnet for migrants and trying to sort of say, reduce the flow through Central America. So I think there's lots of ways to do it, but ultimately it's trying to improve the conditions in the principal source countries like Venezuela and Central America, the so-called northern triangle countries, which have been racked by criminal violence and so on. If people feel that they have a future there, they're obviously less likely to come into the U.S. and that I think is the only real solution here.\n\nSIERRA: What feels like is missing is anything related to climate. We\u2019re coming off the warmest year on record, and coverage of fires and floods and drought seemed constant. So is climate just not on the list at all?\n\nSTARES: So climate is indirectly included. I think many of the contingencies include at least implicitly the possibility that either severe weather events or droughts or water shortages or fights over access to water could become a real source of conflict. And so there's several places where that is definitely, I think, an issue - in the Horn of Africa, in the Sahel, maybe even parts of Asia too. So while it's not specifically mentioned in most contingencies, that is definitely part of the mix. There's no question about that. And we're seeing more and more I think concern over the impact of climate change as a driver or an accelerant, if you will, of conflict. It's just very hard to assess the likelihood of specific climate related events and how they would trigger violent conflict. That's always been really difficult to predict in a precise way.\n\nSIERRA: Overall, is there anything on there that you would like to draw more attention to or were even surprised by?\n\nSTARES: I think there's a sort of macro observation this year that really caught my attention. We've never seen this level of anxiety or foreboding about a year in advance. Three of the thirty contingencies were judged to be high likelihood and high impact, and we've never had that. Even last year, I think there wasn't what we call a high-high, a high likelihood high impact, but this year we had three - unprecedented, never happened before. And of the thirty contingencies, only two were considered low probability. Again, pretty scary stuff when you think about it that so many people are really worried about the direction of the world and particularly conflict trends in the world. Something I think I mentioned last year this time was that the countries that were uppermost in the minds of many U.S. foreign policy experts sort of related to, if you will, the kind of post 9/11 agenda. These were countries where the U.S. city either sent troops to fight in or were worried about instability there and drawing in troops down the road. And for many years after 9/11, these parts of the world dominated our concerns about the world. And Afghanistan was up there, Iraq obviously, Pakistan, political instability in Pakistan, the possibility of war between India and Pakistan. These dominated how the U.S. foreign policy community, what their principal concerns were. This year, when you look at what's in the lowest tier, many of those same countries are now considered tier three risks where the impact is now considered low. They're still worried about this happening, but thinking that if it were to happen, the impact on the U.S. wouldn't be so great. So Afghanistan is there, Somalia where there are still U.S. forces, Libya, and as I say, India and Pakistan, and political instability in Pakistan, low impact. When you think about it, Pakistan is a nuclear-armed state and anytime you begin to worry about political instability in a nuclear-armed state, frankly you should be, I think, a little more concerned than people seem to believe in or they either didn't understand the implications here. So that was, I thought, the biggest surprise. I'm always worried moreover that because of the concern given to these tier-one conflicts or potential conflicts, some really terrible humanitarian threats don't get the attention. They tend to sort of now fall down the pecking order in terms of things we worry about. But the situation in Sudan, for instance, it\u2019s been terrible this last year. I think the latest UN reports probably puts 10-15,000 died in Darfur or in Southern Sudan alone. That's a terrible situation. In Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, again, there's been a lot of fighting, a lot of refugees displaced, and these sort of slip down our consciousness about what is going on. And South Sudan, the Sahel, this area of Sub-Saharan Africa in the western part of Africa, is again very unstable. It's had a lot of coups in the last 12, 24 months. These places, most foreign policy experts in the U.S. kind of go, \"huh, well if it happens, it happens. Not much we can do about it.\" And so I do worry about that.\n\nLast year saw conflicts worsen around the world. Chances are this list has probably not left you feeling upbeat. But not all is lost. In fact, some countries improved their relationships this year - potentially making the world safer.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/kXyUsD-j9h8?si=7eLF9siqG5EQOI3h&t=2\n\nDW News: U.S. President Joe Biden says he's made real progress in talks with China's leader Xi Jinping\u2026 They announced new cooperation in areas including narcotics, AI, and avoiding military misunderstandings.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kve55JoZmUI\n\nCGTN Global Watch: Armenia and Azerbaijan have been able to agree on the basic principles for a peace treaty. The treaty includes mutual recognition of territorial integrity and sovereignty.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGkTftoY4yA\n\nReuters: Historical foes Greece and Turkey hope to usher in a new era of closer ties\u2026 They agree to pursue good neighborly relations and work on obstacles that have kept them apart.\n\nSTARES: There hasn't been all doom and gloom last year, and maybe it's easy to get fixated with everything that's deteriorated and increased concerns around the world, and I think that's generally justified. But I think there were some silver linings, if you will, relations between the U.S. and China improved somewhat at the end of 2023. There's an agreement to reestablish military-to-military channels to possibly deal with crises if they happen. So that's welcome. U.S. and China is going to try to do something about this fentanyl drug crisis as well. So that's good. You saw China, by the way, playing a positive role in brokering peace between, or rapprochement probably, between Saudi Arabia and Iran last year, a sign of potential Chinese involvement in sort of global security issues. So that I think is encouraging. You have Armenia and Azerbaijan, they've reached some kind of peace agreement. Now, admittedly, that came after this horrible attack by Azerbaijan on this enclave in Azerbaijan known as Nagorno-Karabakh, and some 50,000 refugees were sort of expelled toward Armenia. Terrible thing, but the situation doesn't look to be as bad as it once looked like it would become. Finally, Greece and Turkey began to talk, and the relations between those two countries are seemingly improving. Last year it was in the survey as a potential flashpoint in the Eastern Mediterranean. Yet in recent months, we've seen the leaders of those two countries begin to talk and possibly move in a more peaceful direction. So, some glimmers of hope there, and we can hope that something happens this coming year, which will also, as I say, improve matters in different parts of the world.\n\nSIERRA: Always worth taking a moment to honor the positives. Perhaps, you could do a sister survey that is the positive prediction survey and next year we can go through that.\n\nSTARES: Wouldn't that be great?\n\nSIERRA: It would be lovely. Well, thank you so much, Paul. You know, obviously our policymakers have their work cut out for them, and we as well have to do our part at the ballot box, but I appreciate you walking us through the next year.\n\nSTARES: It's been great.

        "text": "The U.S. Must Invest in its People to Lead Discoveries and Innovations\nNSB News Release\n\nMarch 13, 2024\n\nToday the National Science Board published The State of U.S. Science and Engineering 2024, which shows that although the United States performs more research and development than any other country, the nation\u2019s global position is slipping, as countries in East and Southeast Asia, particularly China, increase their activities.\n\n\u201cThe Indicators report confirms that our nation\u2019s science and engineering (S&E) enterprise increasingly hinges on foreign-born STEM talent and is limited by flat federal R&D investment, all at a time when global innovation continues to accelerate,\u201d said Daniel Reed, Chair of the National Science Board and Presidential Professor of Computational Science at the University of Utah. \u201cMeanwhile, other countries are heavily investing in their own S&E talent development, next-generation research infrastructure, and the advanced technology areas critical to national defense and global economic competitiveness.\u201d\n\nThe science, technology, engineering, and mathematics workforce drives U.S. innovation, which is the linchpin of the nation\u2019s economic and national security. The nation must take action to grow and support domestic talent that is currently left on the sidelines.\n\n\u201c The nation must take action to grow and support domestic talent that is currently left on the sidelines.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must use policies, like a new National Defense and Education Act, and appropriate robust funding to federal science agencies, including through the CHIPS and Science Act, to ensure that our nation does not continue to lose ground to others,\u201d Reed said.\n\nThe report shows the outsized role that foreign-born scientists and engineers play in U.S. competitiveness, especially at the doctoral level. It also reveals how the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted S&E education and research, and negatively impacted mathematics scores for American elementary and secondary students.\n\nThe comprehensive report demonstrates that the U.S. no longer predominates across all elements of science, technology, and innovation. Instead, the nation is distinguished by the strength of its universities as destinations for international students, its highly cited and collaborative research, and its leadership in knowledge and technology intensive services, which include information technology and other information services, scientific R&D services, and software publishing.\n\n\u201cThis report shows the tremendous strength of American research and development, which is the most powerful innovation engine in history\u201d said Arati Prabhakar, Assistant to the President for Science and Technology and Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology. \u201cPresident Biden often says that America can be defined in one word: possibilities. Together, public and private R&D investments are opening new possibilities so we can achieve our nation\u2019s great aspirations.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe United States has long led the pursuit of revolutionary science and impactful innovation,\u201d said Sethuraman Panchanathan, Director of the U.S. National Science Foundation. \u201cWith each Indicators report, we witness new insights and shifting trends from within the nation and beyond our borders. However, this latest report delivers an urgent message: For the U.S. to maintain leadership in science and technology, and the societal and economic impacts that result, we must invest in and accelerate our commitment to STEM and ensure that we unleash our superpower\u2014the collective experiences and motivations from individuals across our entire nation\u2014to the benefit of all.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is time to act, with vision and commitment, by expanding our domestic STEM worker pool, investing in critical science and technology areas, and building the necessary research and development infrastructure to ensure our continued national security and economic independence. The job is not done, and we neglect it at our peril,\u201d Reed said.\n\nOther highlights\n\nResearch and Development: The United States is the largest performer of R&D, with $806 billion in gross domestic expenditures on R&D in 2021. Other top R&D- performing countries include China ($668 billion), Japan ($177 billion), Germany ($154 billion), and South Korea ($120 billion). The United States is also among the world\u2019s most R&D-intensive economies, with R&D expenditures equaling 3.5% of its gross domestic product in 2021.\n\nPublications: Globally, six countries combined produced more than 50% of the worldwide peer-reviewed S&E publications in 2022: China (27%), the United States (14%), India (6%), Germany (3%), the United Kingdom (3%), and Japan (3%). From 2003 to 2022, annual S&E publications increased by roughly a third (36%) in the United States, whereas they increased approximately 10-fold in China and 8-fold in India.\n\nOpen Access: Open-access publications provide free access to peer-reviewed scientific literature without requiring user fees or journal subscriptions. S&E articles published in open-access journals increased over 50-fold in the past two decades, from 19,000 articles published in 2003 to 992,000 articles in 2022.\n\nElementary and Secondary Education: From 2020 to 2023, the average score on a national mathematics assessment for all 13-year-old students dropped by 9 points. Scores for students in the 10th percentile \u2014 those scoring near the low end of all assessment takers \u2014 dropped by 14 points, whereas scores for students in the 90th percentile dropped by 6 points. As a result, the gap between students scoring in the 10th percentile (213) and the 90th percentile (322) widened to 109 points, the largest it has been since the assessment began in 1978.\n\nSTEM Workforce: In 2021, the U.S. STEM workforce comprised 36.8 million people in diverse occupations that require STEM knowledge and expertise, accounting for 24% of the total U.S. workforce. Just over half of STEM workers, or 19.3 million workers, are part of the skilled technical workforce, which means they do not have bachelor\u2019s degrees or higher. Foreign-born individuals made up 19% of all U.S. STEM workers and 43% of doctoral-level scientists and engineers.\n\nKnowledge- and Technology-Intensive (KTI) Industries: The U.S. is the largest provider of KTI services, with $1.3 trillion in value-added output in 2021. KTI industries are those classified by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development as high R&D intensive and medium-high R&D intensive industries based on R&D intensity. U.S. KTI services\u2019 output more than doubled from 2012 to 2021, increasing the U.S. share of global KTI services from 30% in 2012 to 39% in 2021, nearly twice the EU-27\u2019s share (21%) of global KTI services in 2021.\n\nInvention and Innovation: Inventors based in China surpassed those based in the U.S. for international total patent applications for the first time in 2021. Patents issued by the Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) focus on inventions, both foreign and domestic, that are granted exclusive use rights in the U.S. market. Of the 325,000 USPTO utility patents granted in 2022, a total of 142,000 (44%) were granted to U.S. inventors. Foreign inventors\u2019 share of patents increased from 52% in 2012 to 56% in 2022.\n\nPublic Perceptions: Americans\u2019 degree of trust in scientists has remained high for decades, although it varies by level of education and has fluctuated in recent years. In 2022, 77% of adults in the United States expressed either \u201ca great deal\u201d or \u201ca fair amount\u201d of confidence in scientists to act in the best interests of the public.\n\nAbout Science and Engineering Indicators\n\nScience and Engineering Indicators is a congressionally mandated report on the state of the U.S. and international science and engineering enterprise. Indicators provides high-quality quantitative information on the enterprise in a series of reports and a data tool that provides state-level data.\n\nAbout the NSB\n\nThe National Science Foundation Act of 1950 charged the NSB with two roles: to be the governing board of the NSF and an advisor to Congress and the President on policy matters related to STEM research and STEM education. Selected for their distinguished service and accomplishments in academia, government, and the private sector, the Board\u2019s 24 presidentially appointed members are leaders in STEM research and education.\n\nAbout the NCSES\n\nNSF\u2019s National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES) is the nation's leading provider of statistical data on the U.S. science and engineering enterprise. As a principal federal statistical agency, NCSES serves as a clearinghouse for the collection, interpretation, analysis, and dissemination of objective science and engineering data.\n\nMedia Contact: Elizabeth Jeffers, ejeffers@nsf.gov\n\nThe U.S. National Science Foundation propels the nation forward by advancing fundamental research in all fields of science and engineering. NSF supports research and people by providing facilities, instruments and funding to support their ingenuity and sustain the U.S. as a global leader in research and innovation. With a fiscal year 2023 budget of $9.5 billion, NSF funds reach all 50 states through grants to nearly 2,000 colleges, universities and institutions. Each year, NSF receives more than 40,000 competitive proposals and makes about 11,000 new awards. Those awards include support for cooperative research with industry, Arctic and Antarctic research and operations, and U.S. participation in international scientific efforts.\n\nUseful NSB Web Sites:\n\nHome Page: http://www.nsf.gov/nsb\n\nMedia Contact: http://www.nsf.gov/staff/staff_bio.jsp?lan=nlymn&org=NSF\n\nNews: http://www.nsf.gov/nsb/news\n\nMeetings: http://www.nsf.gov/nsb/meetings\n\nPublications: http://www.nsf.gov/nsb/publications\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/NationalScienceBoard\n\nTwitter: Twitter: https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=NSF_NSB\n\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkrHRzuGSrPp2haQs0T_Pww\n\n",

        "text": "Where Donald Trump's four criminal trials stand after more delays\nWhere Donald Trump's four criminal trials stand after more delays\n\nReuters\n\nDonald Trump's long journey through the American legal system took a few new twists and turns this week. And each new development is making it less and less likely that the former president will stand trial before he stands before the American people in November's presidential election. Here's a look at the latest on each of the big prosecutions targeting Mr Trump and when, or if, they might begin.\n\nNew York document dump\n\nMr Trump's New York City trial on charges that his hush-money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels constituted business fraud and violated federal campaign finance laws was scheduled a week from Monday, on 25 March. That's no longer the case. The US justice department just turned over more than 73,000 pages of documents related to its own hush-money investigations that the Trump legal team had subpoenaed back in January. Another 15,000 pages are still expected. \"Prosecutors have been stumbling a bit,\" says John Coffee, a professor at Columbia University. He adds that the confusion and delays in producing documents make it seem as though the justice department and the New York district attorney's office are feuding. The former president's lawyers requested a 30-day trial delay, which the New York prosecutors agreed not to block. That's just the start, though. Mr Trump's lawyers want hearings into why the documents, which include witness interviews, took so long to produce. They also want an additional delay for time to review the new evidence and prevent the trial from starting on Passover and, for good measure, a dismissal of the case entirely. Originally scheduled for 25 March, on Friday it was delayed until April, at the earliest.\n\nFani's choice\n\nAfter days of tense legal hearings, the judge presiding over the sprawling 2020 election-interference case against Mr Trump and 18 of his co-defendants issued his decision on whether Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis could remain in charge of the prosecution. The answer was yes - but with a catch. Either she or Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor she hired - and had a romantic relationship with - would have to step aside. Mr Wade resigned on Friday. Judge Scott McAfee said that there were \"reasonable questions\" about whether the two attorneys had testified untruthfully and an \"appearance of impropriety\" that had to be remedied. While he ultimately concluded that evidence did not support removing the district attorney entirely, such language will provide plenty of ammunition for Mr Trump and his team to use in the court of public opinion, where they might be able to shape the views of prospective jurors. \"Everybody here is likely to be influenced by the news coverage of the judge's decision,\" says Adrienne Jones, an assistant political science professor at Atlanta's Morehouse College. \"It's not likely people are ignorant of what's happening.\" The judge's announcement comes just a few days after he dismissed three of the 13 charges against the former president for being too vague. Prosecutors will have an opportunity to clarify and re-indict Mr Trump, however. The prosecution has proposed an 5 August start.\n\nClassified files slow-walk\n\nDown in Fort Pierce, Florida, Judge Aileen Cannon has been reviewing a series of attempts by Trump's legal team to get the federal case against the president for obstruction of justice and mishandling classified documents dismissed. On Thursday, she rejected one of the motions - but she must decide on six others and seems in no big hurry to do so. She is also expected to issue a decision at some point on a schedule for when the trial will begin. At the moment, the start date is 20 May, but both the prosecution and Mr Trump's teams have suggested pushing that back. Ms Cannon, who was appointed to the federal bench by the former president, is considering how to handle disclosure of the troves of classified documents that are part of the case, and any decision - or appeal of that decision - could lead to even more extensive delays. Special Counsel Jack Smith has offered 8 July as a rescheduled start. Mr Trump's lawyers have said that if the case isn't pushed after the election entirely, the earliest they would be ready to begin is August.\n\nSupreme Court limbo",

        "text": "At presidential election forum, VCU political analysts frame Biden-Trump rematch in familiar terms\nIn a political environment of unyielding division and unprecedented circumstances, some very traditional measures will still lead the way in this year\u2019s presidential race.\n\nAt a March 13 forum, three Virginia Commonwealth University analysts highlighted voter turnout \u2013 and mobilizing party bases \u2013 as keys to whether Democratic incumbent Joe Biden wins a second consecutive term or Republican Donald Trump returns to the White House. VCU Department of Political Science professors John Aughenbaugh, Alex Keena and Allie Reckendorf discussed the presidential rematch during a \u201cCivil Discourse\u201d event sponsored by VCU Libraries and hosted by public affairs research librarian Nia Rodgers, who produces the \u201cCivil Discourse\u201c podcast.\n\nAughenbaugh noted how researchers have documented the declining number of undecided independent voters in just the past two to three decades. If most voters identify strongly enough as a Democrat or Republican, they are prepared to support the party candidate no matter who it is.\n\n\u201cThen the next question becomes, \u2018Are we motivated enough to get out to vote for our party\u2019s candidate?\u2019\u201d Aughenbaugh said.\n\nKeena added that political parties in recent decades operated under the theory that to win a national election, presidential candidates were best seen as being moderates. They might espouse more liberal or conservative positions during state primaries, but they would emphasize more centrist views for the general election. The Democratic Party has largely used this approach.\n\nTrump, though, doesn\u2019t hew to this model. And at the national level, he has steered the Republican Party away from emphasizing appeal to centrist voters, instead favoring mobilization of the candidate\u2019s base.\n\n\u201cTrump won in 2016 not by pivoting to the center but by doubling down on \u2026 positions that other Republicans felt was political suicide,\u201d Keena said.\n\nHe noted that if most voters have already \u201cpicked a team\u201d based on political party, the real issue is whether they go to the polls. Keena said a major question for Biden is whether young voters will turn out as they have in some recent elections framed by hot-button topics \u2013 but will they be motivated enough by the prospect of a second term for Trump?\n\nReckendorf said recent polling found that only 10% of 18- to 34-year-olds have cited democracy as their most important issue ahead of the presidential election \u2013 and this could be an issue for Biden, who has campaigned heavily on the theme that Trump and the Republican Party have undermined democratic principles and institutions.\n\nReckendorf added that young voters have instead cited the economy as the leading issue. That puts them in company with many other groups, and Aughenbaugh said inflation and consumer prices could be bellwethers about how middle-class and lower-income voters will lean in November\u2019s election.\n\nHe also cited the prospect of retrospective voting \u2013 as in, voters looking back at recent years to assess how they are faring now vs. then, and using the answer to judge an incumbent.\n\n(Left to right) Nia Rodgers, public affairs research librarian, served as a moderator for a recent town hall on the 2024 election featuring VCU political science professors Alex Keena, John Aughenbaugh and Allie Reckendorf. (Thomas Kojcsich, Enterprise Marketing and Communications)\n\nAmong other points made by the VCU political analysts at the forum:\n\nMiddle East conflict\n\nThe situation in Gaza is a notable issue for Biden among Muslim Americans and young voters, as evidenced by the large number of ballots marked \u201cuncommitted\u201d in Michigan\u2019s primary. The state has a large Muslim population, and Reckendorf noted that while the roughly 13% of primary voters choosing \u201cuncommitted\u201d wasn\u2019t dramatically more than when Barack Obama ran for re-election, the margin of victory or defeat for Biden could be razor-thin.\n\n\u201cIn a state like Michigan, which is a swing state that Joe Biden only won by 154,000 votes [in 2020], It\u2019s one of those things he\u2019s going to have to look out for,\u201d she said.\n\nTrump\u2019s legal challenges\n\nAughenbaugh noted a rare circumstance framed by Trump\u2019s legal challenges. As of the forum date, Trump was facing more than 80 charges across multiple federal and state cases. He is fighting the federal cases, tied to the Jan. 6, 2021, attacks at the U.S. Capitol, on grounds that include potential immunity from prosecution during his presidency.\n\n\u201cDepending on how and when the Supreme Court rules, we can possibly have a major-party nominee running for president while he is sitting for trial,\u201d Aughenbaugh said.\n\nHe added that Trump could even run for office from a jail cell \u2013 and there\u2019s precedent: In 1920, Socialist Party candidate Eugene Debs ran for president from the federal penitentiary in Atlanta. He was serving a 10-year sentence for sedition stemming from a 1918 speech protesting U.S. involvement in World War I.\n\nMoney\n\nKeena highlighted how political donations and campaign spending, which American courts consider a form of free speech, have grown at rates that far outpace inflation, income growth, the cost of health care and rising college tuition.\n\n\u201cIn 2020, the amount of money being spent was roughly double of what was spent in 2016,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Biden and Democrats, using \u201cthe specter of Trump to strike fear\u201d has been a successful fundraising theme, Keena said, with the money supporting anti-Trump advertising well ahead of November\u2019s election.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, is fighting costly legal battles \u2013 civil and criminal trials \u2013 in ways that could intersect with campaign finance laws, even if enforcement is unlikely. \u201cHe\u2019s spending gobs of money on lawyers, and he\u2019s getting this money from donations from people around the country,\u201d Keena said.",

        "text": "Trump Disqualification Tracker\nAlmost immediately after Jan. 6, 2021, legal commentators began debating whether Section 3 of the 14th Amendment would disqualify former President Donald Trump from running in the 2024 presidential election. They debated whether or not Section 3 applies to a former president, whether it is self-executing, and whether Jan. 6 could be considered an insurrection or rebellion.\n\nSince then, the issue became less abstract, though no less contentious. In February 2021, the U.S. Senate acquitted Trump of an impeachment article for inciting insurrection, but with a bipartisan majority of the Senate voting to convict. Section 3 challenges have been mounted against several legislators, and one state-level county commissioner who participated in the attack was successfully ousted from his post under that provision. At the end of 2022, the House Select Committee on the Jan. 6 Attack on the Capitol made the argument that Trump did inspire an insurrection, referring him to the Justice Department for prosecution under multiple criminal statutes, including one prohibiting insurrection. The Special Counsel\u2019s Office has since brought a criminal case in Washington, D.C. charging Trump for his role in the Jan. 6 attack. And some prominent legal conservatives made the case for a strong, originalist reading of Section 3 that they argue would apply to Trump, immediately disqualifying him from office.\n\nBeginning in winter 2023, voters and advocacy groups have brought Section 3 challenges in courts across the country, attempting to block Trump\u2019s name from appearing on ballots for state primaries and caucuses before the general election begins, as Lawfare tracked and represented in the above map and table below. After Colorado became the first state in the nation to take Trump off its presidential primary ballot in Anderson et. al v. Griswold, the question reached the Supreme Court in Trump\u2019s appeal of the decision in Trump v. Anderson (the docket for which Lawfare tracked and remains below). After hearing oral argument on Feb. 8, the Supreme Court ruled on March 4 that Trump could not be disqualified from Colorado\u2019s presidential primary ballot under Section 3 without Congressional action. (Read Lawfare\u2019s analysis on the decision.) That decision has effectively ended the array of challenges to Trump\u2019s ballot eligibility.\n\nBelow you will find Lawfare\u2019s past and continuing coverage of the legal and policy implications surrounding Trump Section 3 challenges, and primary source documents, analysis, and resources.\n\nThe Trump Disqualification Tracker was created by Hyemin Han with Caleb Benjamin on Oct. 30, 2023. The litigation tracker portion of the project was last updated and edited by Han, Anna Bower, Matt Gluck, Tyler McBrien, and Roger Parloff on March 4, 2024.",

Or do you rather trust your instinct and hope that the party you have a preference for matches your political views?\n\nVoting Advice Applications (so-called VAAs) offer excellent help in doing your \u2018homework\u2019 before elections. Called also \u2018political compass\u2019, \u2018electoral navigator\u2019 or \u2018party-meter\u2019, they are online tools that help users make a choice in a given election.\n\nIn the run-up to the 2024 European Parliament elections, the EUI is working on the release of a European VAA, called EU&I. Today, the project, led by Research Fellow Lorenzo Cicchi, is launching its website which will serve as a hub for useful and engaging content before the actual app is launched on Europe Day, 9 May.\n\nAvailable in over 20 languages, the tool invites users to react to 30 policy statements covering a wide range of contemporary policy issues and political values in European politics such as migration, government spending, green taxes, security and more. It then uses a mathematical algorithm to find which parties stand closest to citizens' preferences on these issues, both in their country and all across Europe.\n\nEU&I uses a sound scientific methodology to analyse and code more than 250 parties participating in the upcoming elections. In the weeks leading up to the 2024 vote, a team of 130 scholars across Europe is meticulously researching party positions and official documentation to position the candidates according to the 30 statements in the questionnaire. To ensure the precision, the online tool will be launched a month before the elections, when all parties will have already announced their positions.\n\nThe EUI has been at the forefront of VAAs for the European elections. In 2009, EU Profiler was created: the very first transnational VAA for European elections. The initiative came from Alexander H. Trechsel, at the time director of the European Democracy Observatory (EUDO, the predecessor of EGPP) and with the strong support of the late Peter Mair. The project, under the new name of EU&I, continued in 2014 and 2019 when the record number of 1.28 million users was reached.\n\nLearn more about this initiative of the European Governance and Politics Programme of the Robert Schuman Centre on its website.\n\n\n\nStay tuned and follow the project's social media channels on X, LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram and Bluesky.",

        "text": "Expanding Empathy Speaker Series returns with scholarly dialogues\nUNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. \u2014 The Rock Ethics Institute's Expanding Empathy Speaker Series returns for its sixth consecutive year starting Tuesday, March 19.\n\nOrganized under the leadership of Daryl Cameron, who is Sherwin Early Career Professor in the Rock Ethics Institute, associate professor of psychology, director of the Consortium on Moral Decision-Making and senior research associate in the Rock Ethics Institute, Expanding Empathy is an international, interdisciplinary examination of empathy and moral decision-making processes.\n\nThis will be the first year that the series is hosted through the new Consortium on Moral Decision-Making, with joint sponsorship through the Rock Ethics Institute, College of the Liberal Arts, Social Science Research Institute, the McCourtney Institute for Democracy and Department of Philosophy, with additional promotional support from the Department of Psychology.\n\nThe broad theme for this year\u2019s series is conflict and change.\n\n\u201cIn an especially tumultuous year, and in advance of the upcoming U.S. presidential election, how can we use empathy and other social emotions (such as compassion and anger/outrage) to motivate change?\u201d Cameron said. \u201cAll of the speakers have won numerous awards and are leaders in their fields about their respective topics.\u201d\n\nTuesday\u2019s panel, from noon to 2 p.m., will focus on empathy, forgiveness and conflict. Each speaker will give short talks followed by conversation with each other and the audience in the second hour.\n\nPsychologist Sa-kiera Hudson of the Haas Business School at UC Berkeley will discuss empathy and \u201ccounter-empathy,\u201d or schadenfreude.\n\nPhilosopher Felipe De Brigard of Duke University will discuss the psychological processes and ethical implications of forgiveness in Colombia.\n\nPsychologist Eran Halperin of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem will discuss empathy and the Israel-Palestine conflict.\n\n\u201cI love bringing people together for these sorts of interdisciplinary conversations,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cI was a philosophy and psychology double major when I got my start on an interdisciplinary collaboration between the two disciplines \u2014 that\u2019s what inspired my interest in moral psychology as a set of core questions. As a co-appointed faculty member in the Rock Ethics Institute, I\u2019m afforded wonderful opportunities to bring together people across the sciences and humanities.\u201d\n\nAdmission to Tuesday\u2019s online event is free, but pre-registration is required.\n\n\u201cI think the series has been successful for several reasons,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cIn terms of the content, I think people like hearing experts from different fields and backgrounds talk about important ethical issues in everyday life.\n\n\u201cHow do we resolve conflicts? How do we get people to care about the lives of people they don\u2019t know? How do we get past moral disagreements and increase the scope of those we care about? How do we manage the interface between humans, animals, and tech such as ChatGPT and AI? These are the sorts of questions we regularly dig into. And the format in the past few years has afforded a lot of interesting interdisciplinary conversations, explicitly designed so that philosophers and psychologists engage each other in conversation as part of each panel,\" said Cameron.\n\nThe second Expanding Empathy panel, slated for Tues., April 2, from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., will delve into the evolution of moral convictions, featuring Linda Skitka of the University of Chicago at Illinois and Matti Wilks from the University of Edinburgh exploring explore \"the moral circle\" and its implications for moral psychology studies. Accompanying them will be philosopher Evan Westra from Purdue University, shedding light on the role of affect and emotions in shaping moral norms.\n\nOn Thurs., April 25, from 10 a.m. to noon, the series will culminate with a discussion on compassion and concern. Stephanie Preston of the University of Michigan will delve into the psychology and neuroscience of compassionate care. Philosopher Walter Sinnott-Armstrong of Duke University will explore the dynamics of compassion across different target groups, while Aleksandra Cichocka of the University of Kent will present groundbreaking research on in-group love and out-group hate.\n\nThe Expanding Empathy Speaker Series epitomizes the Rock Ethics Institutes commitment to fostering interdisciplinary dialogues and advancing ethical discourse on a global scale.

        "text": "How AI-generated disinformation might impact this year\u2019s elections and how journalists should report on it\nA phone call from the US president, covert recordings of politicians, false video clips of newsreaders, and surprising photographs of celebrities. A wide array of media can now be generated or altered with artificial intelligence, sometimes mimicking real people, often very convincingly.\n\nThese kinds of deepfakes are cropping up on the internet, particularly on social media. AI-generated fake intimate images of pop star Taylor Swift recently led to X temporarily blocking all searches of the singer. And it\u2019s not just celebrities whose likeness is faked: deepfakes of news presenters and politicians are also making the rounds.\n\nIn a year in which around 2 billion people are eligible to vote in 50 elections, can AI-generated disinformation impact democratic outcomes? And how is this going to affect journalists reporting on the campaigns? I contacted journalists and experts from Spain, Mexico and India to find out.\n\nThe issue\n\nIf we were to take a snapshot of the deepfakes circulating in recent months, we would find a range of individuals whose likenesses have been faked, for a range of aims. Popular targets are those with abundant examples of their (real) appearance and voice available online: celebrities, newsreaders, politicians. The purpose of these fakes ranges from satire to scams to disinformation.\n\nPoliticians have appeared in deepfakes peddling financial scams. The UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, for example, was impersonated in a range of video ads which appeared on Facebook, as have TV newsreaders, whose image is often used to advertise fake \u2018investment opportunities\u2019, sometimes involving celebrities who may have also been faked.\n\nThere have also been examples of deepfakes of politicians to achieve a political outcome, including some election-related ones. An early example was a (quite unconvincing) video showing a clone of Ukraine\u2019s President Volod\u00edmir Zelensky calling for his troops to lay down their arms only days into the Russian full-scale invasion.\n\nA high-profile and higher-quality recent example was an AI-generated audio message of a fake Joe Biden attempting to dissuade people from voting in the New Hampshire primaries. Another example was a video of Muhammad Basharat Raja, a candidate in Pakistan\u2019s elections, altered to tell voters to boycott the vote.\n\nAI for satire: a view from Spain\n\nCreating AI-generated images has never been easier. With popular and easily accessible tools such as Midjourney, OpenAI\u2019s DALL-E and Microsoft\u2019s Copilot Designer, users can obtain images for their prompts in a matter of seconds. However, AI platforms have put in place some parameters to limit the use of their product.\n\nDALL-E doesn\u2019t allow users to create images of real people and Microsoft\u2019s option prohibits \u2018deceptive impersonation.\u2019 Midjourney only mentions \u2018offensive or inflammatory images of celebrities or public figures\u2019 as examples of content that would breach its community guidelines. Violent and pornographic images are also barred from all of these platforms.\n\nOther tools do allow for a wider range of creation and some people are using them. Spanish collective United Unknown describes itself as a group of \u2018visual guerrilla, video and image creators.\u2019 They use deepfakes to create satirical images. They often portray politicians, as in the images in this piece published by Rodrigo Terrasa at El Mundo.\n\nUnited Unknown\u2019s creations are very realistic, but there\u2019s something in their definition that identifies them as not quite right. The content is often outlandish, such as this series of images depicting Spanish politicians as wrestlers.\n\nEven the more believable pictures have an absurd element that characterises them as satire, such as this series of pictures, labelled by United Unknown as \u201can alternative, and totally false report of the meeting between [Spanish Prime Minister] Pedro S\u00e1nchez and Joe Biden.\u201d The report opens with a typical summit picture of Biden and S\u00e1nchez posing outside the White House in near-identical suits. It quickly descends into comedy, showing the two in cowboy outfits and giddily driving around in a golf cart.\n\nA member of the collective who introduced himself as \u2018Sergey\u2019 told me that United Unknown uses Stable Diffusion, a tool by Stability AI. Stable Diffusion is so far the only one among the main AI image generators that is open-source, meaning its models can be downloaded and modified, allowing users more freedom in what and who they can depict.\n\n\u201cIt is already very easy, and it will be even easier in the very near future\u201d to use AI tools to generate a fake image realistic enough to fool people, Sergey said. \u201cIn just one year the generators have gone from generating very poor quality images, with unrecognisable people, to achieving a photo-realistic result.\u201d\n\nSergey admitted that some of the collective\u2019s more \u2018neutral\u2019 images have been mistaken as real photographs. But he stressed they try to avoid this from happening: \u201cWe work in the field of political satire. We try to make critical humour. There is no intention to use the image to deceive.\u201d\n\nAsked about his fears around AI misuse, Sergey stressed the responsibility and intentions of the user over specific concerns about new tools. \u201cThe responsibility always lies with the author-creator-ideologist, not with the technology used,\u201d Sergey said.\n\n\u201cArtificial intelligence generates images from our instructions,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe results we get are mainly based on our requests but also the knowledge acquired by the models. They replicate, reproduce and even amplify our own values, prejudices, errors and biases. They offer us an image that is a reflection of the idea of us, of the society in which we live and its inequalities.\u201d\n\nThe closing pre-campaign rally of Claudia Sheinbaum, the front-runner presidential candidate of the ruling National Regeneration Movement (MORENA), in Mexico City, Mexico January 18, 2024. REUTERS/Quetzalli Nicte-Ha\n\nAI and elections: India and Mexico\n\nAI-generated images and videos represent a potential danger in the context of elections. But some, including the BBC\u2019s disinformation reporter Marianna Spring, are more concerned about audio and its role in disinformation this year.\n\nMexico\u2019s general elections will be held in early June. According to Arturo Daen, editor of the fact-checking section of the political news site Animal Pol\u00edtico, traditional disinformation around the vote is much more prevalent than AI-generated disinformation. But Daen described an audio clip purportedly recorded by the head of government in Mexico City, Mart\u00ed Batres, expressing a preference for one of the mayoral candidates.\n\nIn the audio, the fake Batres says he wishes to promote one of the candidates, Clara Brugada and gives instructions to work against her rival. Batres claimed the recording was an AI-generated fake.\n\n\u201cWe analysed the material and different tools could not identify with precision if this technology was actually used,\u201d Daen said. \u201cThe case generated alarm for the possible proliferation of this kind of audio and the difficulty of verifying them. Since then, however, we have not encountered more of this type of material, at least at that scale or level of impact.\u201d\n\nA potential new danger of AI-generated disinformation, according to Mexican political scientist Jorge Buend\u00eda, stems from the fact that it can be used to convincingly impersonate politicians, and use their image or voice to spread falsehoods among their own supporters.\n\nAn example of this is the fake Biden phone call cited above, which was used to target Democrat voters in the US. \u201cIn communication theory, there is this principle that who the messenger is matters a lot,\u201d Buend\u00eda said. \u201cAI has the potential to make people believe that the messenger is trustworthy, and that can be a game changer. What we have found in the past is that people will resist the messages that are expressed by people that they don't like. But here the messages are going to be supposedly delivered by people they trust.\u201d\n\nJoe Biden is not the only world leader whose voice has been imitated in this way. India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s voice is also commonly reproduced with AI tools, both as a campaigning tool by his party and for satirical purposes, said Indian independent journalist Srishti Jaswal.\n\nWhile reporting on politics, tech and human rights for various outlets, Jaswal is a Pulitzer Center 2023 AI Accountability Fellow. As part of the fellowship, which runs from September 2023 to July 2024, she is investigating the impact of AI technologies on Indian elections.\n\nAI fake audios and videos have also emerged in India ahead of the upcoming general election, with an example being videos of Manoj Tiwari, a member of parliament for the ruling BJP, addressing audiences in three languages: Hindi, Haryanvi and English. According to Al Jazeera, the Hindi video was genuine and the other two had the audio and video altered using AI to reach audiences who speak those languages.\n\nOn the other hand, AI is also being used on social media for humour, such as to imitate Modi singing songs. \u201cIt has become an epidemic,\u201d Jaswal said. \u201cWherever you go, you see Modi's voice being imitated almost everywhere.\u201d\n\nPart of the risk in Mexico is the high percentage of people without formal education, which often leads to problems in identifying mis- and disinformation, Buend\u00eda said. A similar issue exists in India. Jaswal pointed out that the disparity between India\u2019s internet penetration and the population\u2019s literacy rate could lead to more people not having the tools to understand these nuances.\n\n\u201cIn cases like that, automation and AI can become a very fast and very furious tool to influence people en masse,\u201d she said.\n\nA weapon against women\n\nJaswal gave another recent example of the use of AI in the context of politics. In 2023 an AI-manipulated image was used to discredit female wrestlers protesting against the President of the Federation of Wrestling, who is also an MP for India\u2019s ruling BJP party and whom they accused of sexual harassment.\n\nTwo of the protesters took a selfie while being arrested to see who had been detained along with them. While in the original photo, the women look serious, a manipulated version of the image started circulating on social media showing them with broad smiles. \u201cThis actually discredited the protesters. [People said] how are they happy about this entire thing?\u201d Jaswal said.\n\nJaswal believes AI might also convince Indian women to shy away from speaking openly about their political views.\n\n\u201cMany women have seen that [AI] has been used to generate photographs of them in sexual positions, which is very objectionable in a patriarchal society like this,\u201d said Jaswal, who thinks that some women may choose to step back from being in the public eye in the face of this threat. Bollywood actresses went through these kinds of attacks in November 2023.\n\nAccording to Jaswal, deepfakes are often created by young people looking to go viral and monetise their content and are not so much part of the strategy of organised political campaigns. For young people who are unemployed and facing a rising cost of living, social media can seem like an attractive place to make some money.\n\nAnother reason an individual might generate fake content is a real feeling of contempt towards women, journalists or Muslims, groups that often face intense discrimination, Jaswal noted. Whereas these attitudes are often encouraged by politicians, the people creating and posting targeted faked content often act independently.\n\nHow different is AI-generated disinformation?\n\n\u201cThe manipulation of information is not new, nor are image montages,\u201d Sergey from United Unknown said. \u201cThe media, the technology and the tools change. Are we facing the democratisation of the false and artificial image? We should not be concerned about the technology itself but about its use, and the intentions with which it is used.\u201d\n\nThis attitude is shared by others in the AI field. In a commentary article published in October 2023, researchers Felix Simon, Sacha Altay and Hugo Mercier argue that concerns about AI worsening the problem of misinformation are overblown.\n\nAI may increase the quantity of misinformation, they write, but this won\u2019t necessarily mean people consume more of it because of limits to demand for misinformation, which is already abundant. Even if it does increase the quality of misinformation, that may not have a great impact on audiences either, as there are already non-AI tools available that can make fake images look realistic. Moreover, persuasion is difficult, so even high-quality personalised disinformation would likely have a limited impact.\n\nRegular disinformation is still a greater concern than AI-generated disinformation for the experts I spoke to: Buend\u00eda echoed the idea that \u201cnegative campaigning, exacerbating people's prejudices and beliefs, has been around for centuries.\u201d The only meaningful change, he said, is in the way people receive this disinformation.\n\nBuend\u00eda doesn\u2019t think this year\u2019s elections in Mexico will see much AI-generated disinformation. \u201cIt\u2019s probably too soon,\u201d he said. Jaswal made a similar assessment about her country: \u201cI still feel that the use of AI in Indian elections is at a very nascent stage,\u201d she said, adding that, with time, we could see more complex situations.\n\nHow journalists should address this new threat\n\nDaen wishes fact-checkers could have access to more powerful tools to tell with certainty whether a recording has been deepfaked or not. In the absence of these tools, journalists have to delve into the context of the disputed piece of content, looking at where it first cropped up, which accounts shared it and what kind of content they usually share.\n\n\u201cAI has made us more cautious,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen saying if a material is fake or not, we turn to a deeper investigation before giving a verdict.\u201d This is particularly important in the context of an election campaign.\n\n\u201cI believe it is important to insist on investigations on who is behind disinformation, which agencies or political parties,\u201d Daen said. \u201cWith El Sabueso [Animal Politico\u2019s fact-checking vertical] we have published different reports on disinformation networks, coordinated actions with the aim of disinformation, and we will continue this job during the ongoing electoral process.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, AI companies and social media platforms are aware they are under scrutiny. On 16 February, at the Munich Security Conference, 22 of these companies, including tech giants Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Meta as well as AI developers and social platforms signed on to a joint statement which pledged to address risks to democracy this year of elections. The document lists several \u2018steps\u2019 towards this, including helping to identify AI-generated content, detect their distribution, and address it \u201cin a manner consistent with principles of free expression and safety,\u201d but lacks any tangible targets.\n\nJaswal advises journalists to keep reporting on any further developments. \u201cWith such sinister new technology being used, it takes time,\u201d she says. \"As a journalist reporting, my only approach is to be observant, and I'm observing everything.\u201d",

        "text": "Election 2024: Joe Biden Opposes the Sale of U.S. Steel to Nippon Steel\nPresident Joe Biden yesterday announced his opposition to Japan-based Nippon Steel\u2019s plan to purchase U.S. Steel. His decision no doubt makes for good politics. But it exposes a tension at the core of his foreign policy.\n\nU.S. Steel agreed last December to sell itself to Nippon Steel for $14.1 billion. It was hardly a rash decision. The company that was formed nearly 125 years ago by legendary investor J.P. Morgan has struggled in recent decades to compete against cheaper foreign-made steel, even with the aid of periodic rounds of protection. U.S. Steel entertained offers from domestic rivals before accepting Nippon Steel\u2019s substantially higher offer. Nippon Steel will become the world\u2019s third-largest steel company if the deal goes through.\n\nThe question is whether it will. The sale is now under review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). That review, which assesses the sale\u2019s impact on U.S. national security, could take a year or more. The odds are good that even if the sale gets the go-ahead, the approval will come with conditions.\n\nThe Water's Edge James M.

The president of the United Steelworkers, which represents most of U.S. Steel\u2019s workers, has blasted the proposed sale as \u201cgreedy\u201d and \u201cshortsighted.\u201d In late January, Donald Trump vowed to \u201cblock it instantaneously\u201d if he returned to the White House. Noting that he imposed tariffs in 2018 on imported steel, the forty-fifth president added: \u201cWe saved the steel industry. Now, U.S. Steel is being bought by Japan. So terrible.\u201d\n\nTrailing in the polls and with the union vote poised to play a pivotal role in battleground states in November, Biden had good electoral reasons to oppose the deal. His statement announcing his opposition avoided the question of why Japanese ownership of a U.S. steel producer harmed the United States. Biden instead stressed his solidarity with steelworkers. \u201cI told our steelworkers I have their backs, and I meant it.\u201d That solidarity may not win Biden new supporters. It will likely save him from losing support by denying Trump a line of attack.\n\nBut smart domestic politics doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into wise foreign policy. Biden came to office three years ago vowing to strengthen ties with friends and allies. He didn\u2019t do so for nostalgia\u2019s sake. He instead saw rallying the like-minded as essential to achieving his top foreign policy priority\u2014countering China. His theory of the case was that mobilizing America\u2019s many friends and allies would give Washington the upper hand over Beijing.\n\nIn the intervening three years, U.S. allies have shown themselves ready to answer the call. But the Biden administration has frequently failed to reciprocate. Whether it has been leaving many of Trump\u2019s tariffs in place, allowing the World Trade Organization to continue to wither, negotiating the AUKUS deal, discriminating against foreign producers with the CHIPS Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, and now by opposing the sale of U.S. Steel, the message that Biden administration has been sending, whether unintentional or not, is that Washington is interested in what it can get and not in what it can give. That indifference to the interests of others may come back to haunt the administration.\n\nCampaign Update\n\nWhat was obvious last week became official this week: Biden and Trump are set as the presidential nominees of the Democratic and Republican parties. Biden won big in Georgia, Mississippi, and Washington. Trump ran up similarly large victories in those same states plus Hawaii. Those wins gave both Biden and Trump a majority of the nominating delegates in their party.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy, Jr. said on Wednesday that he would announce his choice of a running mate on March 26. Kennedy\u2019s announcement came a day after he said he was considering former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura and current New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers as running mates. Other rumored running mates for Kennedy include former Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown, former Hawaii Congresswoman and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard, TV host Mike Rowe, and entrepreneur and 2020 Democratic candidate Andrew Yang. Kennedy has qualified for the general election ballot in Utah. He is close to qualifying to run in six other states, including the battleground states of Arizona, Georgia, and Nevada.\n\nThe Candidates in Their Own Words\n\nTrump delivered his response to Biden\u2019s State of the Union address at a campaign rally in Rome, Georgia, on Saturday night. He panned Biden\u2019s address as \u201cthe worst State of the Union speech in history,\u201d an \u201cangry, dark, hate-filled rant\u201d that was \u201cthe most divisive, partisan, radical, and extreme\u201d in U.S. history.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Trump Rome Rally Video Pause Video Pause Trump Rome Rally Embed\n\nTrump argued that by sending aid to Palestinians in Gaza, Biden was seeking \u201cto resupply the terrorists of Hamas.\u201d Trump also asserted that what \u201cBiden has done on our border is a crime against humanity and the people of this nation for which he will never be forgiven.\u201d\n\nAs the U.S. House prepared this week to vote to compel the Chinese owner of TikTok to either sell the company or shut down its operations in the United States, Trump continued to oppose the bill. As president, he supported the effort to compel TikTok\u2019s sale or closure. He justified his change of mind in part on the grounds that banning the social media platform would make young Americans \u201cgo crazy.\u201d\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Trump TikTok Ban Video Pause Video Pause Trump TikTok Ban Embed\n\nBiden, in contrast, supported the House bill, which is officially known as H.R.7521\u2014Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act.\n\nBiden gave MSNBC\u2019s Jonathan Capehart an interview on Saturday. The president explained that his hot mic comment after last week\u2019s State of the Union address\u2014he was heard saying \u201cI told Bibi, don\u2019t repeat this, you and I are going to have a \u2018come to Jesus\u2019 meeting\u201d\u2014was merely meant to convey that the two men needed to have \u201ca serious meeting.\u201d\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Biden MSNBC Video Pause Video Pause Biden MSNBC Embed\n\nBiden added that, \u201cin my view, [Netanyahu] is hurting Israel more than helping Israel\u201d with the high loss of civilian life in Gaza. \u201cIt\u2019s contrary to what Israel stands for. And I think it\u2019s a big mistake. So, I want to see a [six-week] ceasefire.\u201d When asked if an Israeli attack on Rafah would cross a red line for him, Biden said: \u201cIt is a red line, but I\u2019m never going to leave Israel. The defense of Israel is still critical, so there\u2019s no red line [where] I\u2019m going to cut off all weapons so they don\u2019t have the Iron Dome to protect them. But there\u2019s red lines... he cannot have 30,000 more Palestinians dead as a consequence of going after [Hamas]. There\u2019s other ways... to deal with the trauma caused by Hamas.\u201d\n\nWhat the Pundits Are Saying\n\nTom Nichols wrote in The Atlantic that Trump should not receive briefings from the U.S. intelligence community even though he is the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. Nichols contends that \u201cTrump is an anti-American, debt-ridden, unstable man who has voiced his open support for violent seditionists. If he were any other citizen asking for the privilege of handling classified material, he would be sent packing.\u201d\n\nSusan Glasser listened to Trump\u2019s Saturday night rally in Rome, Georgia, and thinks you should too, because of \u201cthe pointed contrast\u201d between Biden\u2019s State of the Union address and Trump\u2019s response. \u201cLike so much about Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign, this insane oration was largely overlooked and under-covered, the flood of lies and B.S. seen as old news from a candidate whose greatest political success has been to acclimate a large swath of the population to his ever more dangerous alternate reality. No wonder Biden, trapped in a real world of real problems that defy easy solutions, is struggling to defeat him.\u201d\n\nNoah Rothman argued in the National Review that \u201cthe difference between Trump and Biden.\u201d In Rothman\u2019s view, neither Trump nor Biden \u201cseek to establish a stark division between them on issues as central to the American economy as foreign trade,\u201d where both favor protectionist policies.\n\nWhat the Polls Show\n\nPundits praised Biden for his State of the Union address last week. Some voters agreed. An ABC/Ipsos poll found that 44 percent of Americans who knew of the speech thought it was better than they expected. That compared to 18 percent who thought it was worse than they expected. That said, the speech doesn\u2019t look to have changed minds. A Yahoo News/YouGov survey found no evidence that the speech gave Biden a bump. That result doesn\u2019t look to be an outlier. FiveThirtyEight\u2019s opinion ratings average shows that opinions of Biden are essentially unchanged in the aftermath of the State of the Union. So much for the bully pulpit.\n\nPerhaps bearing out the adage that absence makes the heart grow fonder, a USA Today/Suffolk poll found that 49 percent of voters now give a thumbs up to Trump's job performance as president. Trump\u2019s approval rating never surpassed that mark during his presidency.\n\nGallup released a poll showing that Americans aren\u2019t feeling love from overseas. Just 42 percent of respondents think that the United States is viewed \u201cvery favorably\u201d or \u201csomewhat favorably\u201d in \u201cthe eyes of the world.\u201d That\u2019s down seven percentage points from a year ago. Just 37 percent thought that \u201cleaders of other countries around the world have respect for\u201d Biden, down from 58 percent shortly after he took office. That makes Biden the third of the last four presidents to see answers to that question slope downward over the course of his presidency. The one exception? Trump. But while Trump saw that trend line inch upward during his presidency, his best number was just 37 percent.\n\nThe Campaign Schedule\n\nThe oral arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court on Trump\u2019s claim to enjoy blanket immunity for any committed while president are forty-one days away (April 25, 2024).\n\nThe Republican National Convention opens in Milwaukee in 122 days (July 15, 2024).\n\nThe Democratic National Convention opens in Chicago in 157 days (August 19, 2024).\n\nElection Day is 235 days away.\n\nInauguration Day is 311 days away.\n\nSinet Adous and Aliya Kaisar assisted in the preparation of this post.",

        "text": "Biden faces Irish backlash over Israel-Hamas war ahead of St. Patrick's Day event with Ireland's leader\nThis St. Patrick's Day will see all of the customary White House traditions: Green ties will be worn, grip-and-grin photo opportunities between diplomats will be had, and a bowl of shamrocks will be presented to President Biden by Ireland's leader, Leo Varadkar, as he visits the White House before a traditional lunch with congressional leaders Friday.\n\nBut amid the pomp and pageantry to mark St. Patrick's Day, which is on Sunday, the diplomatic discussions at this year's festivities may have a certain edge to them, as public fury rises in Ireland over President Biden's stance on the Israel-Hamas war. There will be pressure on the Irish delegation from their constituents and elected officials back at home to call out what they see as American complicity in the deaths of tens of thousands of Palestinians.\n\nVaradkar, Ireland's prime minister, or Taoiseach, as he's called in the Irish language, has spent the week in the U.S. and, while he's been quick to compliment Mr. Biden and his administration ahead of the two men's first bilateral meeting later Friday, Varadkar has also been assertive in pushing Ireland's position when it comes to the war in Gaza.\n\nIrish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar with U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, during a breakfast meeting hosted by Harris at her official residence in Washington, D.C., March 15, 2024, during his visit to the U.S. for St Patrick's Day. Niall Carson/PA Images/Getty\n\nSpeaking alongside Vice President Kamala Harris on Friday morning, Varadkar praised Harris and said she'd shown \"great courage and leadership in recent weeks, when you spoke publicly in favor of a cease-fire in Gaza... we support the work of the United States in trying to bring that about.\"\n\nAhead of a meeting with Mr. Biden in the Oval Office, Varadkar told reporters he was keen to talk about situation with the president.\n\n\"You know my view that we need to have a ceasefire as soon as possible to get food and medicine in and the hostages out,\" Varadkar said. \"We need to talk about how we can make that happen and move towards a two-state solution which I think is the only way we'll have lasting peace and security.\"\n\n\"I agree,\" Mr. Biden responded.\n\nVaradkar has called for a permanent cease-fire, while Mr. Biden wants a temporary one of at least six weeks as part of a hostage deal.\n\nAfter their Oval Office meeting, Mr. Biden and Varadkar attended the annual Friends of Ireland lunch on Capitol Hill.\n\nMr. Biden said that he was \"deeply grateful for Ireland's unwavering humanitarian aid\" to Gaza and Ukraine, and again called on Congress to send him a foreign aid bill.\n\n\"I'm committed to continue to do our part,\" Mr. Biden said.\n\nVaradkar was measured when he spoke of Mr. Biden earlier in the week.\n\n\"The situation in Gaza is catastrophic and of great concern, and I have to say I believe President Biden's heart is in the right place here,\" Varadkar said, speaking to reporters at a dinner in Washington on Wednesday. \"I know he's working with Egypt, with Qatar, Saudi and other countries in the region like the Jordanians to try and get Israel and Hamas to agree to a ceasefire.\"\n\n\"But I also want to put across the very strong view of the Irish people that there should be an immediate cease-fire,\" the Irish leader added.\n\nOn Tuesday in Boston, Varadkar said that \"when thousands of children are being killed, no one can avert their eyes.\"\n\nPresident Biden meets Taoiseach Leo Varadkar on April 13, 2023 in Dublin, Ireland. Niall Carson/Getty\n\nHis remarks, while hardly a condemnation of the Biden administration's Middle East policy, may sting an American president who considers himself the most Irish of recent U.S. leaders. It was less than a year ago that Mr. Biden \u2014 who's known to regularly cite the poetry of Seamus Heaney and make reference to his Irish ancestors arriving in America on \"coffin\" ships \u2014 visited the country, to great diplomatic success.\n\nThe president was greeted with adulation by elected Irish officials and members of the public as thousands of people turned up to watch him address a large crowd in his great-great-great grandfather's hometown of Ballina in County Mayo last April.\n\nMuch of that enthusiasm appears to have evaporated on Irish soil as the war in Gaza rages.\n\n\"It's amazing how much things can change in a year,\" said Aodh\u00e1n \u00d3 R\u00edord\u00e1in, a center-left Irish lawmaker who warmly welcomed Mr. Biden to Dublin last year, when the U.S. leader addressed both chambers of Ireland's parliament.\n\n\"That visit would be impossible today,\" said \u00d3 R\u00edord\u00e1in. \"If that happened today, there would be nobody in the chamber.\"\n\n\u00d3 R\u00edord\u00e1in said while the average Irish person would have warmly welcomed Mr. Biden a year ago, owing largely to his heritage, he would receive no such homecoming this year, after more than five months of imagery showing mass destruction in the embattled Palestinian enclave.\n\n\"What we see from the Irish vantage point is the elimination of 30,000 lives, disproportionately women and children,\" he told CBS News. \"What we see is a very well equipped, well armed, powerful nation exact revenge on a very beleaguered people.\"\n\nIreland has long been considered one of the biggest proponents of the Palestinian people's call for an end to Israeli occupation and statehood \u2014 partly due to what the Irish public see as parallels in the two peoples' histories. The history of British occupation still leaves an indelible mark on the collective Irish psyche.\n\n\"I think that's very clear from Irish history. I think that's part of it,\" said \u00d3 R\u00edord\u00e1in. \"We have muscle memory of instances such as Bloody Sunday or British atrocities in Ireland\u2026 there is a clear delineation between the acts of a terrorist organization and the retribution of a state.\"\n\nFatin Al Tamimi, an Irish-Palestinian national who emigrated to the Emerald Isle in 1988, told CBS News that public outrage over the conflict has led to thousands of Irish people showing up at weekly demonstrations she's helped to organize across the country. The protesters, including some 100,000 people who took to the streets for one demonstration in Dublin last month, are also demanding an immediate cease-fire.\n\n\"The Irish are human,\" Al Tamimi told CBS News. \"They feel with others and they refuse oppression.\"\n\nAl Tamimi said that, like many in the Irish public, she didn't believe Varadkar and his delegation should even have visited the White House for St. Patrick's Day this year.\n\nMembers of political parties from both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland traditionally visit the White House for St. Patrick's Day, but this year, the leader of one of Northern Ireland's smaller Irish nationalist parties decided to boycott the event.\n\n\"I'm not going to the White House, which is basically a kind of party and not much more,\" said Colum Eastwood, the leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party. \"I just think it would be kind of gross to be drinking pints of Guinness and eating canapes when Biden is facilitating what's happening in Gaza.\"\n\n\"All we've really seen from the White House has been briefings that he [Biden] is a bit annoyed with Netanyahu. It's a bit pathetic, really, when America is providing Israel with weapons and when bombs are being dropped on children.\"\n\nThe disconnect between Irish political leadership and the White House can be seen in clear terms when it comes to funding of UNRWA, the United Nations humanitarian agency for Palestinians \u2014 a controversial agency that is nonetheless considered a vital lifeline for desperate civilians in Gaza.\n\nIsrael alleged in January that at least a dozen UNRWA staff members took part in Hamas' bloody Oct. 7 terror attack, prompting the U.S. and a number of other Western nations to suspend further funding for the agency pending a full investigation.\n\nIreland has not only continued funding UNRWA, it committed about $22 million in new funding for the agency in February, citing the \"humanitarian catastrophe\" in Gaza.\n\nIreland's President Michael Higgins, whose role is largely ceremonial, roundly condemned the pause in funding by other countries this week, calling it, \"a propaganda campaign against the United Nations\" and a \"scandalous travesty.\"\n\n\"Those countries, and they include some of the strongest economies in the world, who have removed over $450m from the UNRWA budget must take account of what is now being shown on the television screens of the world for all to see \u2014 infant children dying from lack of oxygen,\" Higgins said in a statement.\n\nSara Cook and Caitlin Yilek contributed reporting.",

        "text": "Where Donald Trump's four criminal trials stand after more delays\nWhere Donald Trump's four criminal trials stand after more delays\n\nReuters\n\nDonald Trump's long journey through the American legal system took a few new twists and turns this week. And each new development is making it less and less likely that the former president will stand trial before he stands before the American people in November's presidential election. Here's a look at the latest on each of the big prosecutions targeting Mr Trump and when, or if, they might begin.\n\nNew York document dump\n\nMr Trump's New York City trial on charges that his hush-money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels constituted business fraud and violated federal campaign finance laws was scheduled a week from Monday, on 25 March. That's no longer the case. The US justice department just turned over more than 73,000 pages of documents related to its own hush-money investigations that the Trump legal team had subpoenaed back in January. Another 15,000 pages are still expected. \"Prosecutors have been stumbling a bit,\" says John Coffee, a professor at Columbia University. He adds that the confusion and delays in producing documents make it seem as though the justice department and the New York district attorney's office are feuding. The former president's lawyers requested a 30-day trial delay, which the New York prosecutors agreed not to block. That's just the start, though. Mr Trump's lawyers want hearings into why the documents, which include witness interviews, took so long to produce. They also want an additional delay for time to review the new evidence and prevent the trial from starting on Passover and, for good measure, a dismissal of the case entirely. Originally scheduled for 25 March, on Friday it was delayed until April, at the earliest.\n\nFani's choice\n\nAfter days of tense legal hearings, the judge presiding over the sprawling 2020 election-interference case against Mr Trump and 18 of his co-defendants issued his decision on whether Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis could remain in charge of the prosecution. The answer was yes - but with a catch. Either she or Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor she hired - and had a romantic relationship with - would have to step aside. Mr Wade resigned on Friday. Judge Scott McAfee said that there were \"reasonable questions\" about whether the two attorneys had testified untruthfully and an \"appearance of impropriety\" that had to be remedied. While he ultimately concluded that evidence did not support removing the district attorney entirely, such language will provide plenty of ammunition for Mr Trump and his team to use in the court of public opinion, where they might be able to shape the views of prospective jurors. \"Everybody here is likely to be influenced by the news coverage of the judge's decision,\" says Adrienne Jones, an assistant political science professor at Atlanta's Morehouse College. \"It's not likely people are ignorant of what's happening.\" The judge's announcement comes just a few days after he dismissed three of the 13 charges against the former president for being too vague. Prosecutors will have an opportunity to clarify and re-indict Mr Trump, however. The prosecution has proposed an 5 August start.\n\nClassified files slow-walk\n\nDown in Fort Pierce, Florida, Judge Aileen Cannon has been reviewing a series of attempts by Trump's legal team to get the federal case against the president for obstruction of justice and mishandling classified documents dismissed. On Thursday, she rejected one of the motions - but she must decide on six others and seems in no big hurry to do so. She is also expected to issue a decision at some point on a schedule for when the trial will begin. At the moment, the start date is 20 May, but both the prosecution and Mr Trump's teams have suggested pushing that back. Ms Cannon, who was appointed to the federal bench by the former president, is considering how to handle disclosure of the troves of classified documents that are part of the case, and any decision - or appeal of that decision - could lead to even more extensive delays. Special Counsel Jack Smith has offered 8 July as a rescheduled start. Mr Trump's lawyers have said that if the case isn't pushed after the election entirely, the earliest they would be ready to begin is August.\n\nSupreme Court limbo",

        "text": "At presidential election forum, VCU political analysts frame Biden-Trump rematch in familiar terms\nIn a political environment of unyielding division and unprecedented circumstances, some very traditional measures will still lead the way in this year\u2019s presidential race.\n\nAt a March 13 forum, three Virginia Commonwealth University analysts highlighted voter turnout \u2013 and mobilizing party bases \u2013 as keys to whether Democratic incumbent Joe Biden wins a second consecutive term or Republican Donald Trump returns to the White House. VCU Department of Political Science professors John Aughenbaugh, Alex Keena and Allie Reckendorf discussed the presidential rematch during a \u201cCivil Discourse\u201d event sponsored by VCU Libraries and hosted by public affairs research librarian Nia Rodgers, who produces the \u201cCivil Discourse\u201c podcast.\n\nAughenbaugh noted how researchers have documented the declining number of undecided independent voters in just the past two to three decades. If most voters identify strongly enough as a Democrat or Republican, they are prepared to support the party candidate no matter who it is.\n\n\u201cThen the next question becomes, \u2018Are we motivated enough to get out to vote for our party\u2019s candidate?\u2019\u201d Aughenbaugh said.\n\nKeena added that political parties in recent decades operated under the theory that to win a national election, presidential candidates were best seen as being moderates. They might espouse more liberal or conservative positions during state primaries, but they would emphasize more centrist views for the general election. The Democratic Party has largely used this approach.\n\nTrump, though, doesn\u2019t hew to this model. And at the national level, he has steered the Republican Party away from emphasizing appeal to centrist voters, instead favoring mobilization of the candidate\u2019s base.\n\n\u201cTrump won in 2016 not by pivoting to the center but by doubling down on \u2026 positions that other Republicans felt was political suicide,\u201d Keena said.\n\nHe noted that if most voters have already \u201cpicked a team\u201d based on political party, the real issue is whether they go to the polls. Keena said a major question for Biden is whether young voters will turn out as they have in some recent elections framed by hot-button topics \u2013 but will they be motivated enough by the prospect of a second term for Trump?\n\nReckendorf said recent polling found that only 10% of 18- to 34-year-olds have cited democracy as their most important issue ahead of the presidential election \u2013 and this could be an issue for Biden, who has campaigned heavily on the theme that Trump and the Republican Party have undermined democratic principles and institutions.\n\nReckendorf added that young voters have instead cited the economy as the leading issue. That puts them in company with many other groups, and Aughenbaugh said inflation and consumer prices could be bellwethers about how middle-class and lower-income voters will lean in November\u2019s election.\n\nHe also cited the prospect of retrospective voting \u2013 as in, voters looking back at recent years to assess how they are faring now vs. then, and using the answer to judge an incumbent.\n\n(Left to right) Nia Rodgers, public affairs research librarian, served as a moderator for a recent town hall on the 2024 election featuring VCU political science professors Alex Keena, John Aughenbaugh and Allie Reckendorf. (Thomas Kojcsich, Enterprise Marketing and Communications)\n\nAmong other points made by the VCU political analysts at the forum:\n\nMiddle East conflict\n\nThe situation in Gaza is a notable issue for Biden among Muslim Americans and young voters, as evidenced by the large number of ballots marked \u201cuncommitted\u201d in Michigan\u2019s primary. The state has a large Muslim population, and Reckendorf noted that while the roughly 13% of primary voters choosing \u201cuncommitted\u201d wasn\u2019t dramatically more than when Barack Obama ran for re-election, the margin of victory or defeat for Biden could be razor-thin.\n\n\u201cIn a state like Michigan, which is a swing state that Joe Biden only won by 154,000 votes [in 2020], It\u2019s one of those things he\u2019s going to have to look out for,\u201d she said.\n\nTrump\u2019s legal challenges\n\nAughenbaugh noted a rare circumstance framed by Trump\u2019s legal challenges. As of the forum date, Trump was facing more than 80 charges across multiple federal and state cases. He is fighting the federal cases, tied to the Jan. 6, 2021, attacks at the U.S. Capitol, on grounds that include potential immunity from prosecution during his presidency.\n\n\u201cDepending on how and when the Supreme Court rules, we can possibly have a major-party nominee running for president while he is sitting for trial,\u201d Aughenbaugh said.\n\nHe added that Trump could even run for office from a jail cell \u2013 and there\u2019s precedent: In 1920, Socialist Party candidate Eugene Debs ran for president from the federal penitentiary in Atlanta. He was serving a 10-year sentence for sedition stemming from a 1918 speech protesting U.S. involvement in World War I.\n\nMoney\n\nKeena highlighted how political donations and campaign spending, which American courts consider a form of free speech, have grown at rates that far outpace inflation, income growth, the cost of health care and rising college tuition.\n\n\u201cIn 2020, the amount of money being spent was roughly double of what was spent in 2016,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Biden and Democrats, using \u201cthe specter of Trump to strike fear\u201d has been a successful fundraising theme, Keena said, with the money supporting anti-Trump advertising well ahead of November\u2019s election.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, is fighting costly legal battles \u2013 civil and criminal trials \u2013 in ways that could intersect with campaign finance laws, even if enforcement is unlikely. \u201cHe\u2019s spending gobs of money on lawyers, and he\u2019s getting this money from donations from people around the country,\u201d Keena said.",

        "text": "Expanding Empathy Speaker Series returns with scholarly dialogues\nUNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. \u2014 The Rock Ethics Institute's Expanding Empathy Speaker Series returns for its sixth consecutive year starting Tuesday, March 19.\n\nOrganized under the leadership of Daryl Cameron, who is Sherwin Early Career Professor in the Rock Ethics Institute, associate professor of psychology, director of the Consortium on Moral Decision-Making and senior research associate in the Rock Ethics Institute, Expanding Empathy is an international, interdisciplinary examination of empathy and moral decision-making processes.\n\nThis will be the first year that the series is hosted through the new Consortium on Moral Decision-Making, with joint sponsorship through the Rock Ethics Institute, College of the Liberal Arts, Social Science Research Institute, the McCourtney Institute for Democracy and Department of Philosophy, with additional promotional support from the Department of Psychology.\n\nThe broad theme for this year\u2019s series is conflict and change.\n\n\u201cIn an especially tumultuous year, and in advance of the upcoming U.S. presidential election, how can we use empathy and other social emotions (such as compassion and anger/outrage) to motivate change?\u201d Cameron said. \u201cAll of the speakers have won numerous awards and are leaders in their fields about their respective topics.\u201d\n\nTuesday\u2019s panel, from noon to 2 p.m., will focus on empathy, forgiveness and conflict. Each speaker will give short talks followed by conversation with each other and the audience in the second hour.\n\nPsychologist Sa-kiera Hudson of the Haas Business School at UC Berkeley will discuss empathy and \u201ccounter-empathy,\u201d or schadenfreude.\n\nPhilosopher Felipe De Brigard of Duke University will discuss the psychological processes and ethical implications of forgiveness in Colombia.\n\nPsychologist Eran Halperin of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem will discuss empathy and the Israel-Palestine conflict.\n\n\u201cI love bringing people together for these sorts of interdisciplinary conversations,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cI was a philosophy and psychology double major when I got my start on an interdisciplinary collaboration between the two disciplines \u2014 that\u2019s what inspired my interest in moral psychology as a set of core questions. As a co-appointed faculty member in the Rock Ethics Institute, I\u2019m afforded wonderful opportunities to bring together people across the sciences and humanities.\u201d\n\nAdmission to Tuesday\u2019s online event is free, but pre-registration is required.\n\n\u201cI think the series has been successful for several reasons,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cIn terms of the content, I think people like hearing experts from different fields and backgrounds talk about important ethical issues in everyday life.\n\n\u201cHow do we resolve conflicts? How do we get people to care about the lives of people they don\u2019t know? How do we get past moral disagreements and increase the scope of those we care about? How do we manage the interface between humans, animals, and tech such as ChatGPT and AI? These are the sorts of questions we regularly dig into. And the format in the past few years has afforded a lot of interesting interdisciplinary conversations, explicitly designed so that philosophers and psychologists engage each other in conversation as part of each panel,\" said Cameron.\n\nThe second Expanding Empathy panel, slated for Tues., April 2, from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., will delve into the evolution of moral convictions, featuring Linda Skitka of the University of Chicago at Illinois and Matti Wilks from the University of Edinburgh exploring explore \"the moral circle\" and its implications for moral psychology studies. Accompanying them will be philosopher Evan Westra from Purdue University, shedding light on the role of affect and emotions in shaping moral norms.\n\nOn Thurs., April 25, from 10 a.m. to noon, the series will culminate with a discussion on compassion and concern. Stephanie Preston of the University of Michigan will delve into the psychology and neuroscience of compassionate care. Philosopher Walter Sinnott-Armstrong of Duke University will explore the dynamics of compassion across different target groups, while Aleksandra Cichocka of the University of Kent will present groundbreaking research on in-group love and out-group hate.\n\nThe Expanding Empathy Speaker Series epitomizes the Rock Ethics Institutes commitment to fostering interdisciplinary dialogues and advancing ethical discourse on a global scale.

        "text": "How AI-generated disinformation might impact this year\u2019s elections and how journalists should report on it\nA phone call from the US president, covert recordings of politicians, false video clips of newsreaders, and surprising photographs of celebrities. A wide array of media can now be generated or altered with artificial intelligence, sometimes mimicking real people, often very convincingly.\n\nThese kinds of deepfakes are cropping up on the internet, particularly on social media. AI-generated fake intimate images of pop star Taylor Swift recently led to X temporarily blocking all searches of the singer. And it\u2019s not just celebrities whose likeness is faked: deepfakes of news presenters and politicians are also making the rounds.\n\nIn a year in which around 2 billion people are eligible to vote in 50 elections, can AI-generated disinformation impact democratic outcomes? And how is this going to affect journalists reporting on the campaigns? I contacted journalists and experts from Spain, Mexico and India to find out.\n\nThe issue\n\nIf we were to take a snapshot of the deepfakes circulating in recent months, we would find a range of individuals whose likenesses have been faked, for a range of aims. Popular targets are those with abundant examples of their (real) appearance and voice available online: celebrities, newsreaders, politicians. The purpose of these fakes ranges from satire to scams to disinformation.\n\nPoliticians have appeared in deepfakes peddling financial scams. The UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, for example, was impersonated in a range of video ads which appeared on Facebook, as have TV newsreaders, whose image is often used to advertise fake \u2018investment opportunities\u2019, sometimes involving celebrities who may have also been faked.\n\nThere have also been examples of deepfakes of politicians to achieve a political outcome, including some election-related ones. An early example was a (quite unconvincing) video showing a clone of Ukraine\u2019s President Volod\u00edmir Zelensky calling for his troops to lay down their arms only days into the Russian full-scale invasion.\n\nA high-profile and higher-quality recent example was an AI-generated audio message of a fake Joe Biden attempting to dissuade people from voting in the New Hampshire primaries. Another example was a video of Muhammad Basharat Raja, a candidate in Pakistan\u2019s elections, altered to tell voters to boycott the vote.\n\nAI for satire: a view from Spain\n\nCreating AI-generated images has never been easier. With popular and easily accessible tools such as Midjourney, OpenAI\u2019s DALL-E and Microsoft\u2019s Copilot Designer, users can obtain images for their prompts in a matter of seconds. However, AI platforms have put in place some parameters to limit the use of their product.\n\nDALL-E doesn\u2019t allow users to create images of real people and Microsoft\u2019s option prohibits \u2018deceptive impersonation.\u2019 Midjourney only mentions \u2018offensive or inflammatory images of celebrities or public figures\u2019 as examples of content that would breach its community guidelines. Violent and pornographic images are also barred from all of these platforms.\n\nOther tools do allow for a wider range of creation and some people are using them. Spanish collective United Unknown describes itself as a group of \u2018visual guerrilla, video and image creators.\u2019 They use deepfakes to create satirical images. They often portray politicians, as in the images in this piece published by Rodrigo Terrasa at El Mundo.\n\nUnited Unknown\u2019s creations are very realistic, but there\u2019s something in their definition that identifies them as not quite right. The content is often outlandish, such as this series of images depicting Spanish politicians as wrestlers.\n\nEven the more believable pictures have an absurd element that characterises them as satire, such as this series of pictures, labelled by United Unknown as \u201can alternative, and totally false report of the meeting between [Spanish Prime Minister] Pedro S\u00e1nchez and Joe Biden.\u201d The report opens with a typical summit picture of Biden and S\u00e1nchez posing outside the White House in near-identical suits. It quickly descends into comedy, showing the two in cowboy outfits and giddily driving around in a golf cart.\n\nA member of the collective who introduced himself as \u2018Sergey\u2019 told me that United Unknown uses Stable Diffusion, a tool by Stability AI. Stable Diffusion is so far the only one among the main AI image generators that is open-source, meaning its models can be downloaded and modified, allowing users more freedom in what and who they can depict.\n\n\u201cIt is already very easy, and it will be even easier in the very near future\u201d to use AI tools to generate a fake image realistic enough to fool people, Sergey said. \u201cIn just one year the generators have gone from generating very poor quality images, with unrecognisable people, to achieving a photo-realistic result.\u201d\n\nSergey admitted that some of the collective\u2019s more \u2018neutral\u2019 images have been mistaken as real photographs. But he stressed they try to avoid this from happening: \u201cWe work in the field of political satire. We try to make critical humour. There is no intention to use the image to deceive.\u201d\n\nAsked about his fears around AI misuse, Sergey stressed the responsibility and intentions of the user over specific concerns about new tools. \u201cThe responsibility always lies with the author-creator-ideologist, not with the technology used,\u201d Sergey said.\n\n\u201cArtificial intelligence generates images from our instructions,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe results we get are mainly based on our requests but also the knowledge acquired by the models. They replicate, reproduce and even amplify our own values, prejudices, errors and biases. They offer us an image that is a reflection of the idea of us, of the society in which we live and its inequalities.\u201d\n\nThe closing pre-campaign rally of Claudia Sheinbaum, the front-runner presidential candidate of the ruling National Regeneration Movement (MORENA), in Mexico City, Mexico January 18, 2024. REUTERS/Quetzalli Nicte-Ha\n\nAI and elections: India and Mexico\n\nAI-generated images and videos represent a potential danger in the context of elections. But some, including the BBC\u2019s disinformation reporter Marianna Spring, are more concerned about audio and its role in disinformation this year.\n\nMexico\u2019s general elections will be held in early June. According to Arturo Daen, editor of the fact-checking section of the political news site Animal Pol\u00edtico, traditional disinformation around the vote is much more prevalent than AI-generated disinformation. But Daen described an audio clip purportedly recorded by the head of government in Mexico City, Mart\u00ed Batres, expressing a preference for one of the mayoral candidates.\n\nIn the audio, the fake Batres says he wishes to promote one of the candidates, Clara Brugada and gives instructions to work against her rival. Batres claimed the recording was an AI-generated fake.\n\n\u201cWe analysed the material and different tools could not identify with precision if this technology was actually used,\u201d Daen said. \u201cThe case generated alarm for the possible proliferation of this kind of audio and the difficulty of verifying them. Since then, however, we have not encountered more of this type of material, at least at that scale or level of impact.\u201d\n\nA potential new danger of AI-generated disinformation, according to Mexican political scientist Jorge Buend\u00eda, stems from the fact that it can be used to convincingly impersonate politicians, and use their image or voice to spread falsehoods among their own supporters.\n\nAn example of this is the fake Biden phone call cited above, which was used to target Democrat voters in the US. \u201cIn communication theory, there is this principle that who the messenger is matters a lot,\u201d Buend\u00eda said. \u201cAI has the potential to make people believe that the messenger is trustworthy, and that can be a game changer. What we have found in the past is that people will resist the messages that are expressed by people that they don't like. But here the messages are going to be supposedly delivered by people they trust.\u201d\n\nJoe Biden is not the only world leader whose voice has been imitated in this way. India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s voice is also commonly reproduced with AI tools, both as a campaigning tool by his party and for satirical purposes, said Indian independent journalist Srishti Jaswal.\n\nWhile reporting on politics, tech and human rights for various outlets, Jaswal is a Pulitzer Center 2023 AI Accountability Fellow. As part of the fellowship, which runs from September 2023 to July 2024, she is investigating the impact of AI technologies on Indian elections.\n\nAI fake audios and videos have also emerged in India ahead of the upcoming general election, with an example being videos of Manoj Tiwari, a member of parliament for the ruling BJP, addressing audiences in three languages: Hindi, Haryanvi and English. According to Al Jazeera, the Hindi video was genuine and the other two had the audio and video altered using AI to reach audiences who speak those languages.\n\nOn the other hand, AI is also being used on social media for humour, such as to imitate Modi singing songs. \u201cIt has become an epidemic,\u201d Jaswal said. \u201cWherever you go, you see Modi's voice being imitated almost everywhere.\u201d\n\nPart of the risk in Mexico is the high percentage of people without formal education, which often leads to problems in identifying mis- and disinformation, Buend\u00eda said. A similar issue exists in India. Jaswal pointed out that the disparity between India\u2019s internet penetration and the population\u2019s literacy rate could lead to more people not having the tools to understand these nuances.\n\n\u201cIn cases like that, automation and AI can become a very fast and very furious tool to influence people en masse,\u201d she said.\n\nA weapon against women\n\nJaswal gave another recent example of the use of AI in the context of politics. In 2023 an AI-manipulated image was used to discredit female wrestlers protesting against the President of the Federation of Wrestling, who is also an MP for India\u2019s ruling BJP party and whom they accused of sexual harassment.\n\nTwo of the protesters took a selfie while being arrested to see who had been detained along with them. While in the original photo, the women look serious, a manipulated version of the image started circulating on social media showing them with broad smiles. \u201cThis actually discredited the protesters. [People said] how are they happy about this entire thing?\u201d Jaswal said.\n\nJaswal believes AI might also convince Indian women to shy away from speaking openly about their political views.\n\n\u201cMany women have seen that [AI] has been used to generate photographs of them in sexual positions, which is very objectionable in a patriarchal society like this,\u201d said Jaswal, who thinks that some women may choose to step back from being in the public eye in the face of this threat. Bollywood actresses went through these kinds of attacks in November 2023.\n\nAccording to Jaswal, deepfakes are often created by young people looking to go viral and monetise their content and are not so much part of the strategy of organised political campaigns. For young people who are unemployed and facing a rising cost of living, social media can seem like an attractive place to make some money.\n\nAnother reason an individual might generate fake content is a real feeling of contempt towards women, journalists or Muslims, groups that often face intense discrimination, Jaswal noted. Whereas these attitudes are often encouraged by politicians, the people creating and posting targeted faked content often act independently.\n\nHow different is AI-generated disinformation?\n\n\u201cThe manipulation of information is not new, nor are image montages,\u201d Sergey from United Unknown said. \u201cThe media, the technology and the tools change. Are we facing the democratisation of the false and artificial image? We should not be concerned about the technology itself but about its use, and the intentions with which it is used.\u201d\n\nThis attitude is shared by others in the AI field. In a commentary article published in October 2023, researchers Felix Simon, Sacha Altay and Hugo Mercier argue that concerns about AI worsening the problem of misinformation are overblown.\n\nAI may increase the quantity of misinformation, they write, but this won\u2019t necessarily mean people consume more of it because of limits to demand for misinformation, which is already abundant. Even if it does increase the quality of misinformation, that may not have a great impact on audiences either, as there are already non-AI tools available that can make fake images look realistic. Moreover, persuasion is difficult, so even high-quality personalised disinformation would likely have a limited impact.\n\nRegular disinformation is still a greater concern than AI-generated disinformation for the experts I spoke to: Buend\u00eda echoed the idea that \u201cnegative campaigning, exacerbating people's prejudices and beliefs, has been around for centuries.\u201d The only meaningful change, he said, is in the way people receive this disinformation.\n\nBuend\u00eda doesn\u2019t think this year\u2019s elections in Mexico will see much AI-generated disinformation. \u201cIt\u2019s probably too soon,\u201d he said. Jaswal made a similar assessment about her country: \u201cI still feel that the use of AI in Indian elections is at a very nascent stage,\u201d she said, adding that, with time, we could see more complex situations.\n\nHow journalists should address this new threat\n\nDaen wishes fact-checkers could have access to more powerful tools to tell with certainty whether a recording has been deepfaked or not. In the absence of these tools, journalists have to delve into the context of the disputed piece of content, looking at where it first cropped up, which accounts shared it and what kind of content they usually share.\n\n\u201cAI has made us more cautious,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen saying if a material is fake or not, we turn to a deeper investigation before giving a verdict.\u201d This is particularly important in the context of an election campaign.\n\n\u201cI believe it is important to insist on investigations on who is behind disinformation, which agencies or political parties,\u201d Daen said. \u201cWith El Sabueso [Animal Politico\u2019s fact-checking vertical] we have published different reports on disinformation networks, coordinated actions with the aim of disinformation, and we will continue this job during the ongoing electoral process.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, AI companies and social media platforms are aware they are under scrutiny. On 16 February, at the Munich Security Conference, 22 of these companies, including tech giants Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Meta as well as AI developers and social platforms signed on to a joint statement which pledged to address risks to democracy this year of elections. The document lists several \u2018steps\u2019 towards this, including helping to identify AI-generated content, detect their distribution, and address it \u201cin a manner consistent with principles of free expression and safety,\u201d but lacks any tangible targets.\n\nJaswal advises journalists to keep reporting on any further developments. \u201cWith such sinister new technology being used, it takes time,\u201d she says. \"As a journalist reporting, my only approach is to be observant, and I'm observing everything.\u201d",

        "text": "Election 2024: Joe Biden Opposes the Sale of U.S. Steel to Nippon Steel\nPresident Joe Biden yesterday announced his opposition to Japan-based Nippon Steel\u2019s plan to purchase U.S. Steel. His decision no doubt makes for good politics. But it exposes a tension at the core of his foreign policy.\n\nU.S. Steel agreed last December to sell itself to Nippon Steel for $14.1 billion. It was hardly a rash decision. The company that was formed nearly 125 years ago by legendary investor J.P. Morgan has struggled in recent decades to compete against cheaper foreign-made steel, even with the aid of periodic rounds of protection. U.S. Steel entertained offers from domestic rivals before accepting Nippon Steel\u2019s substantially higher offer. Nippon Steel will become the world\u2019s third-largest steel company if the deal goes through.\n\nThe question is whether it will. The sale is now under review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). That review, which assesses the sale\u2019s impact on U.S. national security, could take a year or more. The odds are good that even if the sale gets the go-ahead, the approval will come with conditions.\n\nThe Water's Edge James M.

The president of the United Steelworkers, which represents most of U.S. Steel\u2019s workers, has blasted the proposed sale as \u201cgreedy\u201d and \u201cshortsighted.\u201d In late January, Donald Trump vowed to \u201cblock it instantaneously\u201d if he returned to the White House. Noting that he imposed tariffs in 2018 on imported steel, the forty-fifth president added: \u201cWe saved the steel industry. Now, U.S. Steel is being bought by Japan. So terrible.\u201d\n\nTrailing in the polls and with the union vote poised to play a pivotal role in battleground states in November, Biden had good electoral reasons to oppose the deal. His statement announcing his opposition avoided the question of why Japanese ownership of a U.S. steel producer harmed the United States. Biden instead stressed his solidarity with steelworkers. \u201cI told our steelworkers I have their backs, and I meant it.\u201d That solidarity may not win Biden new supporters. It will likely save him from losing support by denying Trump a line of attack.\n\nBut smart domestic politics doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into wise foreign policy. Biden came to office three years ago vowing to strengthen ties with friends and allies. He didn\u2019t do so for nostalgia\u2019s sake. He instead saw rallying the like-minded as essential to achieving his top foreign policy priority\u2014countering China. His theory of the case was that mobilizing America\u2019s many friends and allies would give Washington the upper hand over Beijing.\n\nIn the intervening three years, U.S. allies have shown themselves ready to answer the call. But the Biden administration has frequently failed to reciprocate. Whether it has been leaving many of Trump\u2019s tariffs in place, allowing the World Trade Organization to continue to wither, negotiating the AUKUS deal, discriminating against foreign producers with the CHIPS Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, and now by opposing the sale of U.S. Steel, the message that Biden administration has been sending, whether unintentional or not, is that Washington is interested in what it can get and not in what it can give. That indifference to the interests of others may come back to haunt the administration.\n\nCampaign Update\n\nWhat was obvious last week became official this week: Biden and Trump are set as the presidential nominees of the Democratic and Republican parties. Biden won big in Georgia, Mississippi, and Washington. Trump ran up similarly large victories in those same states plus Hawaii. Those wins gave both Biden and Trump a majority of the nominating delegates in their party.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy, Jr. said on Wednesday that he would announce his choice of a running mate on March 26. Kennedy\u2019s announcement came a day after he said he was considering former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura and current New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers as running mates. Other rumored running mates for Kennedy include former Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown, former Hawaii Congresswoman and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard, TV host Mike Rowe, and entrepreneur and 2020 Democratic candidate Andrew Yang. Kennedy has qualified for the general election ballot in Utah. He is close to qualifying to run in six other states, including the battleground states of Arizona, Georgia, and Nevada.\n\nThe Candidates in Their Own Words\n\nTrump delivered his response to Biden\u2019s State of the Union address at a campaign rally in Rome, Georgia, on Saturday night. He panned Biden\u2019s address as \u201cthe worst State of the Union speech in history,\u201d an \u201cangry, dark, hate-filled rant\u201d that was \u201cthe most divisive, partisan, radical, and extreme\u201d in U.S. history.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Trump Rome Rally Video Pause Video Pause Trump Rome Rally Embed\n\nTrump argued that by sending aid to Palestinians in Gaza, Biden was seeking \u201cto resupply the terrorists of Hamas.\u201d Trump also asserted that what \u201cBiden has done on our border is a crime against humanity and the people of this nation for which he will never be forgiven.\u201d\n\nAs the U.S. House prepared this week to vote to compel the Chinese owner of TikTok to either sell the company or shut down its operations in the United States, Trump continued to oppose the bill. As president, he supported the effort to compel TikTok\u2019s sale or closure. He justified his change of mind in part on the grounds that banning the social media platform would make young Americans \u201cgo crazy.\u201d\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Trump TikTok Ban Video Pause Video Pause Trump TikTok Ban Embed\n\nBiden, in contrast, supported the House bill, which is officially known as H.R.7521\u2014Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act.\n\nBiden gave MSNBC\u2019s Jonathan Capehart an interview on Saturday. The president explained that his hot mic comment after last week\u2019s State of the Union address\u2014he was heard saying \u201cI told Bibi, don\u2019t repeat this, you and I are going to have a \u2018come to Jesus\u2019 meeting\u201d\u2014was merely meant to convey that the two men needed to have \u201ca serious meeting.\u201d\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Biden MSNBC Video Pause Video Pause Biden MSNBC Embed\n\nBiden added that, \u201cin my view, [Netanyahu] is hurting Israel more than helping Israel\u201d with the high loss of civilian life in Gaza. \u201cIt\u2019s contrary to what Israel stands for. And I think it\u2019s a big mistake. So, I want to see a [six-week] ceasefire.\u201d When asked if an Israeli attack on Rafah would cross a red line for him, Biden said: \u201cIt is a red line, but I\u2019m never going to leave Israel. The defense of Israel is still critical, so there\u2019s no red line [where] I\u2019m going to cut off all weapons so they don\u2019t have the Iron Dome to protect them. But there\u2019s red lines... he cannot have 30,000 more Palestinians dead as a consequence of going after [Hamas]. There\u2019s other ways... to deal with the trauma caused by Hamas.\u201d\n\nWhat the Pundits Are Saying\n\nTom Nichols wrote in The Atlantic that Trump should not receive briefings from the U.S. intelligence community even though he is the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. Nichols contends that \u201cTrump is an anti-American, debt-ridden, unstable man who has voiced his open support for violent seditionists. If he were any other citizen asking for the privilege of handling classified material, he would be sent packing.\u201d\n\nSusan Glasser listened to Trump\u2019s Saturday night rally in Rome, Georgia, and thinks you should too, because of \u201cthe pointed contrast\u201d between Biden\u2019s State of the Union address and Trump\u2019s response. \u201cLike so much about Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign, this insane oration was largely overlooked and under-covered, the flood of lies and B.S. seen as old news from a candidate whose greatest political success has been to acclimate a large swath of the population to his ever more dangerous alternate reality. No wonder Biden, trapped in a real world of real problems that defy easy solutions, is struggling to defeat him.\u201d\n\nNoah Rothman argued in the National Review that \u201cthe difference between Trump and Biden.\u201d In Rothman\u2019s view, neither Trump nor Biden \u201cseek to establish a stark division between them on issues as central to the American economy as foreign trade,\u201d where both favor protectionist policies.\n\nWhat the Polls Show\n\nPundits praised Biden for his State of the Union address last week. Some voters agreed. An ABC/Ipsos poll found that 44 percent of Americans who knew of the speech thought it was better than they expected. That compared to 18 percent who thought it was worse than they expected. That said, the speech doesn\u2019t look to have changed minds. A Yahoo News/YouGov survey found no evidence that the speech gave Biden a bump. That result doesn\u2019t look to be an outlier. FiveThirtyEight\u2019s opinion ratings average shows that opinions of Biden are essentially unchanged in the aftermath of the State of the Union. So much for the bully pulpit.\n\nPerhaps bearing out the adage that absence makes the heart grow fonder, a USA Today/Suffolk poll found that 49 percent of voters now give a thumbs up to Trump's job performance as president. Trump\u2019s approval rating never surpassed that mark during his presidency.\n\nGallup released a poll showing that Americans aren\u2019t feeling love from overseas. Just 42 percent of respondents think that the United States is viewed \u201cvery favorably\u201d or \u201csomewhat favorably\u201d in \u201cthe eyes of the world.\u201d That\u2019s down seven percentage points from a year ago. Just 37 percent thought that \u201cleaders of other countries around the world have respect for\u201d Biden, down from 58 percent shortly after he took office. That makes Biden the third of the last four presidents to see answers to that question slope downward over the course of his presidency. The one exception? Trump. But while Trump saw that trend line inch upward during his presidency, his best number was just 37 percent.\n\nThe Campaign Schedule\n\nThe oral arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court on Trump\u2019s claim to enjoy blanket immunity for any committed while president are forty-one days away (April 25, 2024).\n\nThe Republican National Convention opens in Milwaukee in 122 days (July 15, 2024).\n\nThe Democratic National Convention opens in Chicago in 157 days (August 19, 2024).\n\nElection Day is 235 days away.\n\nInauguration Day is 311 days away.\n\nSinet Adous and Aliya Kaisar assisted in the preparation of this post.",

        "text": "Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro clinches nomination for upcoming national election; seeks third term\nVenezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro on Saturday became his party's official nominee for July's highly anticipated presidential election, which would allow him to stroll into a third consecutive term with no real competition on the horizon.\n\nNot unusual to Venezuela, the election has been plagued with controversy since Maduro's main opponent, Mar\u00eda Corina Machado \u2014 who swept an opposition coalition's primary election with more than 90% of votes \u2014 was disqualified by Venezuelan authorities to hold public office for 15 years.\n\nFILE - In this Jan. 22, 2021 file photo, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro speaks during a ceremony marking the start of the judicial year at the Supreme Court in Caracas, Venezuela. AP Photo/Matias Delacroix, File)\n\nMaduro accepted the nomination as the ruling United Socialist Party's candidate for the July 28 presidential election during a party gathering in Caracas, saying he has \"the support of the people.\" According to the party, its decision was backed by over four million members who chose their candidate last week.\n\n\"A man alone would not be here. I am here for the people,\" Maduro said. \"Here, the candidate is not Maduro. Here, the candidate is the people.\"\n\nMaduro, the hand-picked successor to President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, rose to power in March 2013 following the death of Ch\u00e1vez, whose homespun charm earned him the affection and votes of millions. Winning another term would leave Maduro at the helm of Venezuela's government until 2031.\n\nUnder his rule, Venezuelan has descended into a deep economic crisis, only deepened by American sanctions. The crisis has pushed millions of people to migrate from the South American nation, with many now headed toward the United States.\n\nThe American government rolled back some sanctions on Venezuela's oil, gas and mining sectors last year after Maduro agreed with the opposition to work toward electoral conditions that would allow for a leveled playing field.\n\nBut the Biden administration ended some of the relief after Venezuela's high court upheld a ban on Machado. It has also threatened to pull back additional relief if the Maduro government continues to defy the agreement.\n\nThe deadline for the registration of candidates is March 25, but so far Machado has maintained that she will continue \"until the end,\" although without making clear how she would circumvent the ban on holding office.\n\nIn recent day's, the opposition coalition has questioned the electoral process and called for \"the law to be respected.\"\n\nOther opposition figures have also been disqualified, such as Henrique Capriles, a two-time presidential candidate, who declined to participate before the primary election.\n\nCapriles is among a growing number of voices of government opponents and foreign leaders to urge Machado to step aside to allow voters to rally behind an alternative. He urged her to \"a sense of realism\" this week as Machado has pushed forward.\n\n\"They believe this is just one more election, one more electoral fight where they can run us over, or cheat, that we're going to stay quiet and lower our heads. They haven't understood anything,\" Machado has told supporters at several rallies.",

        "text": "Biden holds record for lowest number of press conferences\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Press conferences? \u201cNo, we\u2019re good,\u201d implies the Biden administration. And the liberal media allows President Joe Biden to get away with it. No president in recorded history has done fewer. It is a basic part of his job. But he insists he is ready for four more years in office.\n\nIt must be nice being Biden. He gets away with things that all the recent presidents would never be allowed to get away with. That must be one of the benefits of old age.\n\nHeck, if former presidents Barack Obama or George H.W. Bush or George W. Bush had allowed millions of illegal immigrants to invade America, they would have been kicked to the curb. Does anyone not believe that?\n\nA recent Gallup poll states that most Americans see the border invasion as a \u201ccritical threat\u201d to our security. At a minimum, every \u201cgotaway\u201d is a national security threat. But Biden does nothing but blame others. Protecting America is another basic part of his job.\n\nAs America\u2019s oldest president, Biden seems to get graded on a curve or we have dramatically lowered the bar for him.\n\nBiden takes advantage of his advantages. No tough questions for him. He picks only those reporters who can talk nicely to him.\n\nYes, you can scream a question to him while he walks to Marine One (his presidential helicopter). Or you can ask a question or two when he is doing a staged event, like when he is eating ice cream in a store.\n\nA definitive non-biased assessment of Biden\u2019s tenure in office would depict him as not doing the fundamentals of the job.\n\nPress conferences allow all Americans to get an immediate regular report on what is going on and what the president has planned. They also allow the media to question the president. This is important because 330 million Americans cannot do so all at once. The best and brightest reporters are given this task and have done it so admirably for over 100 years.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the numbers. Former President Donald Trump did 88 press conferences to Biden\u2019s 33. Obama did 164. Former President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a master of communications, did twice as many press conferences in one year as Biden has done in his entire term thus far.\n\nThis year Biden did one news conference, kind of. He angrily burst into a small room in the White House in an unscheduled early evening meeting with the White House press. What was it about? It concerned his rebuttal to special counsel Robert Hur who wrote of the president\u2019s mental decline in a recent report.\n\nWhy does Biden want to avoid the media, despite many in the media being ultra friendly to him?\n\nMaybe because he would get one of the following questions:\n\n\u2013 Mr. President, the Constitution says that the United States must protect each state from an invasion. Are you failing to do that?\n\n\u2013 Follow-up, Mr. President: Most Americans believe that what is happening at the Mexican border is an invasion. We are not talking about hundreds or thousands of people crossing over illegally over the last three years; we are talking about millions. Why have you done nothing other than blame Congress?\n\n\u2013 Mr. President, why have you rejected a return to the border policies of the Obama administration, which you were a part of?\n\n\u2013 Mr. President, why are you asking Congress to fund other countries\u2019 needs before addressing America\u2019s needs? What can you do and what will you do to protect America?\n\n\u2013 Mr. President, if a president does not abide by his oath of office and does not protect the Constitution, should he be removed from office?\n\n\u2013 Mr. President, you once said while running for office that then-President Trump should be fired due to the 220,000-deaths caused by COVID during his administration. Mr. President, does this mean you should be removed from office since on your watch nearly 800,000 Americans have died of COVID?\n\n\u2013 Mr. President, the Supreme Court ruling on abortion declared that it would be unconstitutional for the federal government to address abortion rights. How can the federal government determine abortion rights alone? Wouldn\u2019t it take a Constitutional Amendment? Or should the states be allowed to decide the abortion issue? Proclaiming anything different would be disingenuous?\n\n\u2013 Mr. President, prior to your presidency, Americans were spending $100 for groceries a week and now are spending over $120 a week for the same items. How is that better for Americans? Is Bidenomics working?\n\n\u2013 Mr. President, why did you allow a Chinese spy balloon to travel across America before shooting it down?\n\nI could go on. But I think you get the point.\n\nBiden needs to be on a platform in prime time addressing these issues from the media and give the American people answers. We are wise enough to fairly evaluate you like we have done past presidents.\n\nA regular press conference in which you respond to tougher questions \u2013 can you do it? Will you do it? Can you do one per month?\n\nIf done well, this move could actually help you. It could alleviate concerns about your declining mental capabilities. Failing to do so confirms our concerns.\n\nIt must be nice being Biden, being old, being treated differently, being given advantages \u2013 but it is not good for America.",

        "text": "Memory a key issue in 2024 presidential election\nMINNEAPOLIS \u2014 Among all the issues being debated in the 2024 presidential race, there is one issue that is especially personal.\n\nThe issue is memory. Both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump have had very public memory lapses.\n\nTrump at 77 and Biden at 81 are the two oldest major candidates to run for president. Both have had memory issues.\n\nThe special counsel looking into Biden's handling of classified documents described Biden as \"an elderly man with a poor memory\" and that a jury would likely not convict him because of that.\n\nTrump has had his own memory stumbles recently, referring once to his wife Melania as \"Mercedes\" and more than once referring to Biden as former President Barack Obama. Polls consistently show that the public is more concerned with Biden's lapses.\n\nA New York Times/Sienna poll earlier this month shows that while 42% agree or somewhat agree that Trump is too old to be president, those numbers are significantly higher for Biden. Seventy-three percent agree or somewhat agree that Biden is too old to be president.\n\nWCCO wondered when slip-ups with names are a serious matter for any of us and what is relatively normal for any age.\n\nDr. Dongming Cai, the director of the N. Bud Grossman Center for Memory Research and Care at the University of Minnesota, was a guest on WCCO Sunday Morning at 10:30 a.m.\n\n\"In general, actually it's common to mix up names in conversation, or even the name of someone who is close to you, in conversation,\" she said. \"It can happen occasionally, especially if you are interacting with a large number of people, or you are under stress, or having a lot of distractions, so this is not necessarily a sign of significant memory problems.\"\n\nCai said it's when the mix-ups become frequent or even constant that you should start being concerned. The N. Bud Grossman Center at the U is devoted to clinical research on memory disorders and to provide expertise in caring for those with dementia and other memory ailments. Research is going on around the world in this field. Here in Minnesota, there is also ongoing research on dementia and memory disorders at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester\n\nYou can watch WCCO Sunday Morning with Esme Murphy and Adam Del Rosso every Sunday at 6 a.m. and 10:30 a.m.",

        "text": "Russian polls close with Putin poised to rule for 6 more years\nPolls were closing in Russia on Sunday evening on the last day of a three-day presidential election. Earlier, Russians crowded outside polling stations at midday, apparently heeding an opposition call to protest against President Vladimir Putin, who is poised to extend his rule of nearly a quarter century for six more years after a relentless crackdown on dissent.\n\nA preliminary announcement from Russia's Central Election Commission as voting wrapped up suggested that voter turnout was around 75% nationwide. Citing exit polling data collected by the All-Russian Center for the Study of Public Opinion (VTsIOM), a state-owned institution, the commission said that Putin had received 87% of the votes and was the election's expected winner. Nikolai Kharitonov, the Communist Party candidate, earned 4.6% of the votes, which was the second-highest share.\n\nThe election that began Friday has taken place in a tightly controlled environment where there are no real alternatives to Putin, no public criticism of him or his war in Ukraine. Putin's fiercest political foe, Alexei Navalny, died in an Arctic prison last month, and other critics are either in jail or in exile.\n\nYulia Navalnaya, Navalny's widow, voted in Russia's election Sunday at the Russian embassy in Berlin, after waiting in line for several hours, the BBC reported. Navalnaya said as she left the embassy that she had written her late husband's surname on her ballot before she cast it, according to the outlet.\n\nYulia Navalnaya, the widow of Alexei Navalny, the Russian opposition leader who died in a prison camp, speaks to the media after leaving the Russian Embassy on the final day of the presidential election in Russia, in Berlin, Germany, March 17, 2024. Annegret Hilse / REUTERS\n\n\"It cannot be that a month before the election, during the campaign, that Putin's main opponent, who was already in prison has been killed,\" Navalnaya said, according to the BBC. Navalny had long been a champion for fair elections in Russia. The opposition leader was banned from entering the country's last presidential election in 2018 as well as this one. Prior to his death, Navalny had called on Russian voters to cast their ballots against Putin at noon on Sunday as a collective act of protest against his reelection. Navalnaya supported the action.\n\nNavalny's associates have urged those unhappy with Putin or the war to protest by coming to the polls at noon on Sunday, a strategy endorsed by Navalny shortly before his death. Team Navalny described it as a success, releasing pictures and videos of people crowding near polling stations in cities across Russia around noon.\n\nAt a Washington, D.C. roast on Saturday night, U.S. President Biden was serious in warning about Putin's grip on power, saying he was \"on the march in Europe.\"\n\n\"Joining us tonight is the Prime Minister of Estonia, the Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States. I say - I say \u2026 We will not, we will not bow down,\" Mr. Biden said. \"They will not bow down and I will not bow down.\"\n\nThe 71-year-old Russian leader faces three token rivals from Kremlin-friendly parties who have refrained from any criticism of his 24-year rule or his full-scale invasion of Ukraine two years ago. Putin has boasted of Russian battlefield successes in the run-up to the vote, but a massive Ukrainian drone attack across Russia early Sunday sent a reminder of challenges faced by Moscow.\n\nA woman casts a ballot at a pooling station during a presidential election in St. Petersburg, Russia, Saturday, March 16, 2024. Dmitri Lovetsky / AP\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry reported downing 35 Ukrainian drones overnight, including four near the Russian capital. Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said there were no casualties or damage.\n\nRussia's wartime economy has proven resilient, expanding despite bruising Western sanctions. The Russian defense industry has served as a key growth engine, working around the clock to churn out missiles, tanks and ammunition.\n\nVoting is taking place at polling stations across the vast country's 11 time zones, in illegally annexed regions of Ukraine, and online. More than 60% of eligible voters had cast ballots as of early Sunday.\n\nDmitry Sergienko, who cast his ballot in Moscow, said he voted for Putin: \"I am happy with everything and want everything to continue as it is now.\"\n\nOlga Dymova, who also backed Putin, said, \"I am sure that our country will only move forward towards success.\"\n\nAnother Moscow voter, who identified himself only by his first name, Vadim, said he hopes for change, but added that \"unfortunately, it's unlikely.\"\n\nNavalny's associates broadcast footage with comments by those who turned up at the polls at noon to protest Putin, their faces blurred to protect their identities.\n\n\"The action has achieved its goals,\" Ivan Zhdanov, the head of Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation, said in a YouTube broadcast. \"The action has shown that there is another Russia, there are people who stand against Putin.\"\n\nAnother Navalny ally, Leonid Volkov, said that the protest was meant to help unify and encourage those who oppose Putin.\n\nIt wasn't possible to confirm if the voters shown lining up at polling stations in videos and photos released by Navalny's associates and some Russian media had responded to the protest call, or merely reflected strong turnout.\n\nLong lines also formed around noon outside Russian diplomatic missions in Berlin, Paris, Milan and other cities with large Russian communities.\n\nBoris Nadezhdin, a liberal politician who tried to join the race on an anti-war platform but was barred from running by election officials, voiced hope that many Russians cast their ballots against Putin.\n\n\"I believe that the Russian people today have a chance to show their real attitude to what is happening by voting not for Putin, but for some other candidates or in some other way, which is exactly what I did,\" he said after voting in Dolgorpudny, just outside Moscow.\n\nThe OVD-Info group that monitors political arrests said that more than 50 people were arrested in 14 cities across Russia on Sunday.\n\nA woman leaves a booth at a polling station during a presidential election in St. Petersburg, Russia, Saturday, March 16, 2024. Dmitri Lovetsky / AP\n\nDespite tight controls, several dozen cases of vandalism at polling stations were reported.\n\nA woman was arrested in St. Petersburg after she threw a firebomb at a polling station entrance, and several others were detained across the country for throwing green antiseptic or ink into ballot boxes.\n\nDmitry Medvedev, a deputy head of the Russian Security Council chaired by Putin, called for toughening the punishment for those who vandalize polling stations, arguing they should face treason charges for attempting to derail the vote amid the fighting in Ukraine.\n\nSome Russian media also posted images of spoiled ballots posted by voters, with \"killer and thief\" inscribed on one, and \"waiting for you in The Hague\" written on another, in a reference to an arrest warrant issued for Putin on war crimes charges related to his alleged responsibility for the abductions of children from Ukraine.\n\nAhead of the election, Putin cast his war in Ukraine, now in its third year, as a life-or-death battle against the West seeking to break up Russia.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin votes online in the presidential election at the Novo-Ogaryovo state residence outside Moscow, Russia March 15, 2024. Sputnik/Mikhail Metzel/Pool via REUTERS\n\nRussian troops have recently made slow advances relying on their edge in firepower, while Ukraine has fought back by intensifying cross-border attacks and launching drone strikes deep inside Russia.\n\nThe Ukrainian shelling of the city of Belgorod near the border killed a 16-year-old girl on Sunday and injured her father, according to the local governor, who also reported two deaths from Ukrainian attacks the previous day.\n\nPutin described the attacks as an attempt by Ukraine to frighten residents and derail Russia's presidential election, saying they \"won't be left unpunished.\"\n\nWestern leaders have derided the election as a travesty of democracy.\n\nBeyond the lack of options for voters, the possibilities for independent monitoring are very limited. No significant international observers were present. Only registered, Kremlin-approved candidates, or state-backed advisory bodies, can assign observers to polling stations, decreasing the likelihood of independent watchdogs.",

I will be running for the post of president of the Russian Federation,\" he declared at a Kremlin event last December.\n\nRussia's leader of 24 years had just handed out top honours to soldiers who had taken part in Russia's \"special military operation\" in Ukraine.\n\nHe was chatting with a small group of participants when the commander of a pro-Russian unit in Ukraine's occupied Donetsk region approached him.\n\n\"We need you, Russia needs you!\" declared Lt-Col Artyom Zhoga, asking him to run as a candidate in Russia's forthcoming presidential election. Everyone voiced their support.\n\nMr Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov later described the decision to run as \"absolutely spontaneous\". But the Kremlin rarely leaves its choreography to chance.\n\nInstead, straight away its well-oiled media machine swung into action.\n\nOn all state channels, President Putin was promoted as a national leader who stood head and shoulders above any potential rivals.\n\nKremlin Press Office Vladimir Putin does not need to campaign - his face is rarely absent from state TV\n\n\"Support for the president transcends party support alone,\" reported one correspondent on state TV news later that week. \"Vladimir Putin is the people's candidate!\"\n\nHe has already been in power in Russia longer than any ruler since Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin.\n\nHe has been president since 2000, apart from four years as prime minister because of a two-term limit imposed by the Russian constitution.\n\nHe has since changed the rules to give himself a clean slate to run again in 2024 by \"switching back to zero\" his previous terms. That means he could also run for another six-year term in 2030, when he will turn 78.\n\nDuring his time in office, Vladimir Putin has methodically tightened his grip on power so no real threat to his rule exists any longer. His most outspoken critics are either dead, in jail or in exile.\n\nREUTERS/Yulia Morozova The only major opposition figure in Russia, Alexei Navalny, is now dead - his widow says he was murdered\n\nYet the Kremlin remained determined to give a semblance of legitimacy to Russia's electoral process.\n\nAlthough there was never any doubt about the ultimate election result, the authorities seemed to care greatly about a high turnout, to be presented as evidence of his popular mandate.\n\nTurnout at the last election in 2018 was officially 68%, but international observers reported several cases of ballot-stuffing.\n\nThis year, voting was easier than ever before, ending on Sunday, and the turnout estimated at higher than 74%.\n\nListen on BBC Sounds: Does Russia's election matter?\n\nIn the parts of occupied Ukraine that Russia calls its \"new regions\", polls opened 10 days before election day, and social media was awash with ads urging people to go vote.\n\nVoters were given a choice of candidate - or rather a semblance of one.\n\nJoining Russia's leader on the ballot was Nikolai Kharitonov, representing the Communist Party, which remains Russia's second most popular party, more than 30 years since the fall of the Soviet Union. It draws its support from a small but loyal base of those nostalgic for their Soviet past.\n\nRussian Communist Party Nikolai Kharitonov is portrayed in a campaign video walking to his imagined new job in the Kremlin\n\nThe other two candidates were Leonid Slutsky of the nationalist LDPR and Vladislav Davankov of the New People, ostensibly a liberal, pro-business party.\n\nDespite their vastly different political standings, all three broadly backed the Kremlin's policies - and none stands a chance against the incumbent.\n\nAnother hopeful - local Moscow councillor Boris Nadezhdin - announced his candidacy last year, generating a rare moment of optimism for opposition-minded voters.\n\nHe was a frequent guest on talk shows on state TV and had been relatively critical of Moscow's war in Ukraine.\n\nBut in a country where many have been jailed for speaking out against the war, he would never make the ballot paper.\n\nThousands queued up to offer signatures in his support, and perhaps spooked by the crowds, Russia's election authorities rejected his bid, claiming that more than 15% of his collected signatures were flawed.\n\nREUTERS/Maxim Shemetov Boris Nadezhdin was barred from running more than a month before the election\n\nMr Nadezhdin's exclusion from the race ended any possibility of a surprise.\n\nTelevised debates took place in the run-up to the vote, without Vladimir Putin taking part.\n\nInstead, TV coverage focused on his regular choreographed meetings with factory workers, soldiers and students while his state-of-the-nation address at the end of February was widely seen as a pre-election pitch aimed at burnishing his credentials as a man of the people.\n\nAlthough some of the speech was devoted to the war in Ukraine, it was largely dedicated to domestic issues. Perhaps a tacit acknowledgement that many Russians are more concerned by problems closer to home than Russia's supposed successes on the battlefield or its endless strife with the West.\n\nRussia's leader proposed a raft of social measures, including a modernised tax system that was \"fairer\" for Russian families and incentives aimed at increasing Russia's dwindling birth rate.\n\nThe speech provided a glimpse into the many issues Russia is facing, including poverty affecting families and faltering education, infrastructure and healthcare.\n\nFor a man who has spent 20 years as president, Vladimir Putin has proven unable to solve many of these issues.\n\nInstead, up to 40% of Russia's budget in 2024 is being spent on the military and national security.\n\nMany of his measures require considerable cash injections or investment, and Russia has a serious corruption problem that means funds often do not reach their intended destinations.\n\nBut that hardly mattered in an election that most international observers believe was neither free nor fair.\n\nIn the absence of genuine enthusiasm for the vote, campaign videos from the poll's also-rans have created a social media buzz, coming across as near-caricatures.\n\nCommunist hopeful Nikolai Kharitonov was portrayed angrily clenching his fist while listening to the latest news from volatile commodity markets. \"We've toyed with capitalism and that's enough!\" he declares, marching across Red Square to take up residence in the Kremlin after his imagined election victory.\n\nOf course, nothing of the sort will happen.\n\nIn another video, nationalist LDPR leader Leonid Slutsky was shown trying out the office of his late predecessor Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who led the party for 30 years until his death two years ago.\n\nWhen an aide tried to switch name-plates on the desk, Mr Slutsky told her forcefully: \"No, leave it there!\"\n\nLDPR/YouTube Leonid Slutsky is quite happy to remain in the shadows of his predecessor and Vladimir Putin\n\nAll it did was show how happy he was to remain a sideshow to Vladimir Putin's main act.\n\nThere have been sporadic acts of protest against the election, particularly on the first day of the vote, when dye was poured into ballot boxes and there have been some cases of arson too.\n\nBut the main intrigue stemmed from so-called \"Noon against Putin\" protests, in which opponents of the long-time leader were urged to swamp polling stations in both Russia and its embassies abroad on Sunday and vote for anyone but him.\n\nThe initiative was taken up Alexei Navalny, who died in prison last month, and reinforced by his widow Yulia Navalnaya, who says he was murdered by \"bloody mobster\" Vladimir Putin.\n\nWatch: Navalny won't see Russia's beautiful future, but we must - Yulia Navalnaya\n\nMs Navalnaya herself said that the purpose of the campaign was mostly to allow supporters to silently identify one another at the polling station, rather than to wield any real change.\n\nOn 18 March, Russians will wake up to find President Putin has been re-elected.\n\nWhen he appears at a victory rally in Moscow, he may even shed a tear - as he did after the 2012 presidential election - and profusely thank voters for the trust they have placed in him.\n\nFor the next six years, the illusion of democracy is all but guaranteed to continue.",

There was no repeat of the sporadic attacks on some polling stations that happened on Friday.\n\nWestern countries lined up to condemn the vote as neither free nor fair.\n\nGermany called it a \"pseudo-election\" under an authoritarian ruler reliant on censorship, repression and violence.\n\nUK Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron condemned \"the illegal holding of elections on Ukrainian territory\".\n\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said \"the Russian dictator is simulating another election\".\n\nIn the words of Navalny ally Leonid Volkov, savagely beaten with a meat hammer in exile in Lithuania last week: \"The percentages drawn for Putin have, of course, not the slightest relation to reality.\"\n\nRussians had three days to vote and people in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine had even longer, in an attempt to persuade residents to take part.\n\nOne election commission official was reported killed in the occupied town of Berdyansk on Sunday and residents spoke of pro-Russian collaborators going from home to home with ballot boxes accompanied by armed soldiers.\n\nAnadolu/Getty Images Officials said turnout was greater than 74% in the election\n\nBut on Russia's carefully controlled state TV channels the result was hailed as a triumph.\n\n\"This is an incredible level of support and unity around the figure of Vladimir Putin,\" said one correspondent excitedly, \"and a signal to Western countries\".\n\nPresident Putin was more subdued as he took questions from reporters, but he did hail Russia's presidential campaign as far more advanced than the US, citing Russia's use of online voting, which officials said brought in eight million voters.\n\nMr Putin had earlier been filmed performing a single keystroke to exercise his democratic right.\n\n\"It's transparent and absolutely objective,\" he suggested, \"not like in the US with mail-in voting... you can buy a vote for $10\".\n\nThe Russian leader made the same false claim about US elections earlier this year but never offered any evidence.\n\nMeanwhile, independent Russian watchdog Golos, which has been branded a foreign agent, said that Russia had never before \"seen a presidential campaign that fell so far short of constitutional standards\".\n\nVladimir Putin is now set to stay in power until at least 2030, and has ruled Russia since 2000 - the longest-serving Kremlin leader since Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin.\n\nGolos was barred from observing the vote but reports of irregularities have emerged, as well as pressure on public sector employees to vote either in polling stations or online.\n\nVoters were not able \"to form and express their free will, or to establish the true outcome of the vote\", it said.\n\nPresident Putin praised opposition campaigners for encouraging voters to turn out in greater numbers, although he condemned those who spoilt their ballots and said action would be taken against them.\n\nFor the first time he referred to Alexei Navalny by name, a month after his most vocal critic died in a penal colony inside the Arctic Circle.\n\nIn a remark possibly aimed at rebutting widespread allegations that he had Navalny killed, Mr Putin confirmed reports that he had explored exchanging him for prisoners held in the West, but on the condition that his rival never returned.\n\n\"I said I'm for it but, unfortunately, what happened happened. What can you do? That's life.\"\n\nYulia Navalnaya described queuing for six hours outside the Russian embassy in Berlin as part of the protest vote campaign. She said she had written her late husband's name on her ballot paper, and praised everyone who turned up, for giving her \"hope that everything is not in vain\".\n\nSean Gallup/Getty Images Yulia Navalnaya had backed calls for anti-Putin voters to turn up at polling stations at midday\n\nOne protest voter in London said she had queued for more than seven hours before casting her ballot.\n\nActivist and lawyer Lyubov Sobol said in Washington DC that the protest votes would not be reflected in the Kremlin's results, \"but this solidarity, this symbol, is nonetheless important\".\n\nRussia's presidential election was never going to be a level playing field. The Kremlin tightly controls the political system, the media and elections.\n\nCommunist Party candidate Nikolai Kharitonov managed little more than 4% of the vote and his fellow candidates even less.\n\nNone of the three were serious candidates and Mr Kharitonov even praised the president ahead of the election for \"trying to consolidate the nation for victory in all areas\".\n\nMillions of Russians will have voted for a fifth Putin presidential term partly because they see no credible alternative.\n\nBut that is purely because the Kremlin has removed any possible challenger from the political landscape. Opponents have either been jailed, or they have fled into exile, or they have lost their lives.",

        "text": "Memory a key issue in 2024 presidential election\nMINNEAPOLIS \u2014 Among all the issues being debated in the 2024 presidential race, there is one issue that is especially personal.\n\nThe issue is memory. Both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump have had very public memory lapses.\n\nTrump at 77 and Biden at 81 are the two oldest major candidates to run for president. Both have had memory issues.\n\nThe special counsel looking into Biden's handling of classified documents described Biden as \"an elderly man with a poor memory\" and that a jury would likely not convict him because of that.\n\nTrump has had his own memory stumbles recently, referring once to his wife Melania as \"Mercedes\" and more than once referring to Biden as former President Barack Obama. Polls consistently show that the public is more concerned with Biden's lapses.\n\nA New York Times/Sienna poll earlier this month shows that while 42% agree or somewhat agree that Trump is too old to be president, those numbers are significantly higher for Biden. Seventy-three percent agree or somewhat agree that Biden is too old to be president.\n\nWCCO wondered when slip-ups with names are a serious matter for any of us and what is relatively normal for any age.\n\nDr. Dongming Cai, the director of the N. Bud Grossman Center for Memory Research and Care at the University of Minnesota, was a guest on WCCO Sunday Morning at 10:30 a.m.\n\n\"In general, actually it's common to mix up names in conversation, or even the name of someone who is close to you, in conversation,\" she said. \"It can happen occasionally, especially if you are interacting with a large number of people, or you are under stress, or having a lot of distractions, so this is not necessarily a sign of significant memory problems.\"\n\nCai said it's when the mix-ups become frequent or even constant that you should start being concerned. The N. Bud Grossman Center at the U is devoted to clinical research on memory disorders and to provide expertise in caring for those with dementia and other memory ailments. Research is going on around the world in this field. Here in Minnesota, there is also ongoing research on dementia and memory disorders at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester\n\nYou can watch WCCO Sunday Morning with Esme Murphy and Adam Del Rosso every Sunday at 6 a.m. and 10:30 a.m.",

        "text": "Russian polls close with Putin poised to rule for 6 more years\nPolls were closing in Russia on Sunday evening on the last day of a three-day presidential election. Earlier, Russians crowded outside polling stations at midday, apparently heeding an opposition call to protest against President Vladimir Putin, who is poised to extend his rule of nearly a quarter century for six more years after a relentless crackdown on dissent.\n\nA preliminary announcement from Russia's Central Election Commission as voting wrapped up suggested that voter turnout was around 75% nationwide. Citing exit polling data collected by the All-Russian Center for the Study of Public Opinion (VTsIOM), a state-owned institution, the commission said that Putin had received 87% of the votes and was the election's expected winner. Nikolai Kharitonov, the Communist Party candidate, earned 4.6% of the votes, which was the second-highest share.\n\nThe election that began Friday has taken place in a tightly controlled environment where there are no real alternatives to Putin, no public criticism of him or his war in Ukraine. Putin's fiercest political foe, Alexei Navalny, died in an Arctic prison last month, and other critics are either in jail or in exile.\n\nYulia Navalnaya, Navalny's widow, voted in Russia's election Sunday at the Russian embassy in Berlin, after waiting in line for several hours, the BBC reported. Navalnaya said as she left the embassy that she had written her late husband's surname on her ballot before she cast it, according to the outlet.\n\nYulia Navalnaya, the widow of Alexei Navalny, the Russian opposition leader who died in a prison camp, speaks to the media after leaving the Russian Embassy on the final day of the presidential election in Russia, in Berlin, Germany, March 17, 2024. Annegret Hilse / REUTERS\n\n\"It cannot be that a month before the election, during the campaign, that Putin's main opponent, who was already in prison has been killed,\" Navalnaya said, according to the BBC. Navalny had long been a champion for fair elections in Russia. The opposition leader was banned from entering the country's last presidential election in 2018 as well as this one. Prior to his death, Navalny had called on Russian voters to cast their ballots against Putin at noon on Sunday as a collective act of protest against his reelection. Navalnaya supported the action.\n\nNavalny's associates have urged those unhappy with Putin or the war to protest by coming to the polls at noon on Sunday, a strategy endorsed by Navalny shortly before his death. Team Navalny described it as a success, releasing pictures and videos of people crowding near polling stations in cities across Russia around noon.\n\nAt a Washington, D.C. roast on Saturday night, U.S. President Biden was serious in warning about Putin's grip on power, saying he was \"on the march in Europe.\"\n\n\"Joining us tonight is the Prime Minister of Estonia, the Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States. I say - I say \u2026 We will not, we will not bow down,\" Mr. Biden said. \"They will not bow down and I will not bow down.\"\n\nThe 71-year-old Russian leader faces three token rivals from Kremlin-friendly parties who have refrained from any criticism of his 24-year rule or his full-scale invasion of Ukraine two years ago. Putin has boasted of Russian battlefield successes in the run-up to the vote, but a massive Ukrainian drone attack across Russia early Sunday sent a reminder of challenges faced by Moscow.\n\nA woman casts a ballot at a pooling station during a presidential election in St. Petersburg, Russia, Saturday, March 16, 2024. Dmitri Lovetsky / AP\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry reported downing 35 Ukrainian drones overnight, including four near the Russian capital. Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said there were no casualties or damage.\n\nRussia's wartime economy has proven resilient, expanding despite bruising Western sanctions. The Russian defense industry has served as a key growth engine, working around the clock to churn out missiles, tanks and ammunition.\n\nVoting is taking place at polling stations across the vast country's 11 time zones, in illegally annexed regions of Ukraine, and online. More than 60% of eligible voters had cast ballots as of early Sunday.\n\nDmitry Sergienko, who cast his ballot in Moscow, said he voted for Putin: \"I am happy with everything and want everything to continue as it is now.\"\n\nOlga Dymova, who also backed Putin, said, \"I am sure that our country will only move forward towards success.\"\n\nAnother Moscow voter, who identified himself only by his first name, Vadim, said he hopes for change, but added that \"unfortunately, it's unlikely.\"\n\nNavalny's associates broadcast footage with comments by those who turned up at the polls at noon to protest Putin, their faces blurred to protect their identities.\n\n\"The action has achieved its goals,\" Ivan Zhdanov, the head of Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation, said in a YouTube broadcast. \"The action has shown that there is another Russia, there are people who stand against Putin.\"\n\nAnother Navalny ally, Leonid Volkov, said that the protest was meant to help unify and encourage those who oppose Putin.\n\nIt wasn't possible to confirm if the voters shown lining up at polling stations in videos and photos released by Navalny's associates and some Russian media had responded to the protest call, or merely reflected strong turnout.\n\nLong lines also formed around noon outside Russian diplomatic missions in Berlin, Paris, Milan and other cities with large Russian communities.\n\nBoris Nadezhdin, a liberal politician who tried to join the race on an anti-war platform but was barred from running by election officials, voiced hope that many Russians cast their ballots against Putin.\n\n\"I believe that the Russian people today have a chance to show their real attitude to what is happening by voting not for Putin, but for some other candidates or in some other way, which is exactly what I did,\" he said after voting in Dolgorpudny, just outside Moscow.\n\nThe OVD-Info group that monitors political arrests said that more than 50 people were arrested in 14 cities across Russia on Sunday.\n\nA woman leaves a booth at a polling station during a presidential election in St. Petersburg, Russia, Saturday, March 16, 2024. Dmitri Lovetsky / AP\n\nDespite tight controls, several dozen cases of vandalism at polling stations were reported.\n\nA woman was arrested in St. Petersburg after she threw a firebomb at a polling station entrance, and several others were detained across the country for throwing green antiseptic or ink into ballot boxes.\n\nDmitry Medvedev, a deputy head of the Russian Security Council chaired by Putin, called for toughening the punishment for those who vandalize polling stations, arguing they should face treason charges for attempting to derail the vote amid the fighting in Ukraine.\n\nSome Russian media also posted images of spoiled ballots posted by voters, with \"killer and thief\" inscribed on one, and \"waiting for you in The Hague\" written on another, in a reference to an arrest warrant issued for Putin on war crimes charges related to his alleged responsibility for the abductions of children from Ukraine.\n\nAhead of the election, Putin cast his war in Ukraine, now in its third year, as a life-or-death battle against the West seeking to break up Russia.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin votes online in the presidential election at the Novo-Ogaryovo state residence outside Moscow, Russia March 15, 2024. Sputnik/Mikhail Metzel/Pool via REUTERS\n\nRussian troops have recently made slow advances relying on their edge in firepower, while Ukraine has fought back by intensifying cross-border attacks and launching drone strikes deep inside Russia.\n\nThe Ukrainian shelling of the city of Belgorod near the border killed a 16-year-old girl on Sunday and injured her father, according to the local governor, who also reported two deaths from Ukrainian attacks the previous day.\n\nPutin described the attacks as an attempt by Ukraine to frighten residents and derail Russia's presidential election, saying they \"won't be left unpunished.\"\n\nWestern leaders have derided the election as a travesty of democracy.\n\nBeyond the lack of options for voters, the possibilities for independent monitoring are very limited. No significant international observers were present. Only registered, Kremlin-approved candidates, or state-backed advisory bodies, can assign observers to polling stations, decreasing the likelihood of independent watchdogs.",

        "text": "\u201cIn some ways this election is unique in American history\u201d\n\u201cYes, the primaries continue until the beginning of June but both candidates have already secured a majority of the delegates to their party conventions.\u201d\n\nDoes this election so far differ from other American presidential elections?\n\n\u201cIn some ways this election is unique in American history. This is the first time a former president is facing criminal charges and several cases are in progress in parallel with his campaign to be re-elected as president. The legal proceedings that Trump is facing also give state and federal courts a very important role in this election.\n\nAccording to many observers, the survival of American democracy is at stake in this year\u2019s presidential election. Both the right and the left are warning of this danger. While the Democrats perceive democracy to be threatened by Trump, the Republicans argue that democracy is threatened by Biden.\n\nAnother factor that makes this year\u2019s election unusual is the age of the two candidates. Biden will be 81 and Trump 78 on election day. No matter which of them wins, he will be the oldest US President ever.\u201d\n\nHow will the election campaign continue now during the spring? Are there any special events we should watch out for?\n\n\u201cSince Biden and Trump have already won their party\u2019s nominations in reality, the upcoming primaries will not be particularly big events as such. Instead, the next important step will be the formal nominations at the party conventions, which will be held by the Republicans on 15\u201318 July and by the Democrats on 19\u201322 August.\n\nOne thing to keep an eye on is Trump\u2019s legal cases. Exactly how these will unfold is unclear, as Trump has appealed several of them. One important date is 22 April, when the Supreme Court will hold a hearing in the federal case on alleged electoral fraud. Trump\u2019s attempt to claim immunity in the case was dismissed by a court in Washington DC and the Supreme Court will now determine whether to uphold that judgment and if so whether the proceedings on electoral fraud can go ahead.\u201d\n\nWhich issues do you think will be most important to American voters?\n\n\u201cIn the midterm elections in 2022, it was primarily two issues that were decisive: a perceived threat to American democracy and abortion rights following the decision by the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade. As the Democrats fared considerably better than expected in the 2022 elections on the back of these two issues, they\u2019re likely to focus on them again in this year\u2019s presidential election.\n\nTwo other issues that will play a major role are immigration and the economy. As things stand, Trump has a certain advantage in opinion polls on both these issues. It will also be important to watch how Biden handles the war between Israel and Hamas. There is growing discontent here, particularly among Arab-American voters in states like Michigan that Biden can\u2019t afford to lose.\u201d\n\n\u00c5sa Malmberg",

        "text": "Middle-aged Americans lonelier than European counterparts\nWashington \u2014 Middle-aged adults in the U.S. tend to report significantly higher levels of loneliness than their European counterparts, possibly due in part to weaker family ties and greater income inequality, according to research published by the American Psychological Association.\n\n\u201cLoneliness is gaining attention globally as a public health issue because elevated loneliness increases one\u2019s risk for depression, compromised immunity, chronic illness and mortality,\u201d said lead author Frank Infurna, PhD, an associate professor of psychology at Arizona State University. \u201cOur research illustrates that people feel lonelier in some countries than in others during middle age. It also sheds light on reasons this may be occurring and how governments can address it with better policies.\u201d\n\nThe research was published in the journal American Psychologist.\n\nConsidering the increased public health focus in the United States (as evidenced by the surgeon general\u2019s 2023 advisory on the epidemic of loneliness and isolation) and abroad (countries such as the United Kingdom and Japan have appointed ministers to address the problem), the researchers explored how loneliness has historically changed over time and how it differs across countries.\n\nInfurna and his colleagues examined data from ongoing, nationally representative longitudinal surveys from the United States and 13 European countries, with more than 53,000 participants from three different generations (the Silent Generation, baby boomers and Generation X). Data were collected from 2002 to 2020 and only included responses given when participants were between the ages of 45 and 65.\n\n\u201cWe focused on middle-aged adults because they form the backbone of society and empirical evidence demonstrates that U.S. midlife health is lagging other industrialized nations,\u201d said Infurna. \u201cMiddle-aged adults carry much of society\u2019s load by constituting most of the workforce, while simultaneously supporting the needs of younger and older generations in the family.\u201d\n\nCompared with European counterparts, adults in the U.S. reported significantly higher levels of loneliness. This \u201cloneliness gap\u201d widened with younger generations (late baby boomers and Generation X) reporting greater loneliness than older ones (early baby boomers and the Silent Generation).\n\nWhile the U.S. showed consistent historical increases in midlife loneliness during the period data were collected, some European nations displayed more varied patterns. For instance, England and Mediterranean Europe demonstrated similar increases in loneliness for later-born participants (late baby boomers and Generation X). Continental and Nordic Europe demonstrated stable or even slightly declining levels across generations.\n\nThe study identified differences in cultural norms, socioeconomic influences and social safety nets between the U.S. and other European countries as potential explanations for the loneliness gap between the U.S. and Europe. Cultural norms in the U.S. are often characterized by individualism, increased social media use, declining social connections and increasing political polarization. The pressure faced by U.S. middle-aged adults is also further compounded by a higher residential mobility, weaker family ties, increasing job insecurity and income inequality. Additionally, social safety nets in the U.S. tend to be less comprehensive compared with some European nations regarding family leave, unemployment protection and childcare support.\n\n\u201cThe cross-national differences observed in midlife loneliness should alert researchers and policymakers to better understand potential root causes that can foster loneliness and policy levers that can change or reverse such trends,\u201d said Infurna.\n\nThe study also found that loneliness is generally on the rise compared with previous generations across both the U.S. and Europe, with Europe\u2019s numbers only slightly behind those of the United States.\n\nThe researchers said that loneliness as a public health issue requires policy interventions tailored to national contexts and generational shifts, including promoting family and work benefits, and reducing income inequality.\n\nLoneliness as a global public health issue has called attention to the importance of advancing social connections, according to Infurna. The study defends the promotion of social safety nets, through generous family and work policies, which may lessen midlife loneliness by reducing financial pressures and work-family conflict, in addition to strengthening job security and workplace flexibility. Infurna said such practices would also address health and gender inequities.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. surgeon general advisory report coupled with nations appointing ministers of loneliness have shined a bright light on loneliness being a global public health issue,\u201d he said. \u201cAs opposed to being considered an epidemic\u2014an outbreak that spreads rapidly and affects many individuals\u2014our findings paint a picture akin to loneliness being endemic, regularly occurring within an area or community.\u201d\n\nArticle: \u201cLoneliness in Midlife: Historical Increases and Elevated Levels in the United States Compared With Europe,\u201d by Frank J.

Nothing in this document shall be regarded as an offer, solicitation, recommendation or advice (whether financial, accounting, legal, tax or other) given by J.P.

Morgan\u201d) have an actual or perceived economic or other incentive in its management of our clients\u2019 portfolios to act in a way that benefits J.P. Morgan. Conflicts will result, for example (to the extent the following activities are permitted in your account): (1) when J.P. Morgan invests in an investment product, such as a mutual fund, structured product, separately managed account or hedge fund issued or managed by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or an affiliate, such as J.P. Morgan Investment Management Inc.; (2) when a J.P. Morgan entity obtains services, including trade execution and trade clearing, from an affiliate; (3) when J.P. Morgan receives payment as a result of purchasing an investment product for a client\u2019s account; or (4) when J.P. Morgan receives payment for providing services (including shareholder servicing, recordkeeping or custody) with respect to investment products purchased for a client\u2019s portfolio. Other conflicts will result because of relationships that J.P. Morgan has with other clients or when J.P. Morgan acts for its own account.\n\nInvestment strategies are selected from both J.P. Morgan and third-party asset managers and are subject to a review process by our manager research teams. From this pool of strategies, our portfolio construction teams select those strategies we believe fit our asset allocation goals and forward-looking views in order to meet the portfolio\u2019s investment objective.\n\nAs a general matter, we prefer J.P. Morgan managed strategies. We expect the proportion of J.P. Morgan managed strategies will be high (in fact, up to 100 percent) in strategies such as, for example, cash and high-quality fixed income, subject to applicable law and any account-specific considerations.\n\nWhile our internally managed strategies generally align well with our forward-looking views, and we are familiar with the investment processes as well as the risk and compliance philosophy of the firm, it is important to note that J.P. Morgan receives more overall fees when internally managed strategies are included. We offer the option of choosing to exclude J.P. Morgan managed strategies (other than cash and liquidity products) in certain portfolios.\n\nThe Six Circles Funds are U.S.-registered mutual funds managed by J.P. Morgan and sub-advised by third parties. Although considered internally managed strategies, JPMC does not retain a fee for fund management or other fund services.\n\nLegal Entity, Brand & Regulatory Information\n\nIn the United States, bank deposit accounts and related services, such as checking, savings and bank lending, are offered by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Member FDIC.\n\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its affiliates (collectively \u201cJPMCB\u201d) offer investment products, which may include bank-managed investment accounts and custody, as part of its trust and fiduciary services. Other investment products and services, such as brokerage and advisory accounts, are offered through J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (\u201cJPMS\u201d), a member of FINRA and SIPC.

        "text": "Russia \u2013 Results of the presidential election (18 Mar. 2024)\nFrance notes the expected result of the presidential election by which Vladimir Putin continues as President of the Russian Federation for a fifth term.\n\nThe electoral process in Russia went ahead against the backdrop of a heightened crackdown on civil society and all forms of opposition to the regime, ever greater restrictions on freedom of expression, and a ban on the operation of independent media outlets. The political opposition figure Alexei Navalny died a few weeks before this election, among other things following a hardening of his conditions of detention by the Russian authorities. Candidates opposed to continuing the war in Ukraine were not allowed to compete in the election, significantly reducing its level of pluralism. International standards in terms of candidates\u2019 equal access to the media during the campaign were not complied with. Once again, the conditions for a free, pluralist and democratic election were not met. France salutes the courage of many Russian citizens who peacefully demonstrated their opposition to this attack on their fundamental political rights.\n\nFrance regrets the fact that, contrary to its international commitments, Russia decided not to invite the observation mission of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which meant that the election went ahead without any impartial international observation.\n\nFrance also condemns the fact that Russia organized a so-called \u201celection\u201d in the Ukrainian territories temporarily occupied by Russia: in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol, as well as part of the regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. The illegal organization of a so-called \u201celection\u201d in the Ukrainian territories temporarily occupied by Russia constitutes a further violation of international law and the Charter of the United Nations. France does not and will never recognize the holding of this so-called \u201celection\u201d and its results, and reaffirms its commitment to Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity.\n\nFrance also condemns the fact that Russia set up polling stations in the separatist regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, as well as the region of Transnistria in the Republic of Moldova, without the consent of the Georgian or Moldovan authorities.",

The debaters were assigned to their respective sides randomly, and the discussion had a purely intellectual and academic character - thus, the debaters did not express their personal preferences.\n\nEach participant delivered a five-minute opening speech, followed by presenting arguments, to which the opposing side was obliged to respond.\n\nFollowing this part, Prof. Mark J. Rozell, Dean and founder of the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University in the USA, and Prof. Marek Pietra\u015b, Director of the Institute of International Relations at the Faculty of Political Science and Journalism UMCS, shared their expert opinions.

        "text": "Putin claims landslide in Russian election and scorns US democracy\nPutin claims landslide in Russian election and scorns US democracy\n\nWatch: Supporters applaud Putin as he thanks Russians for putting their trust in him\n\nBut when election officials said results gave him more than 87% of the vote, he said Russia's democracy was more transparent than many in the West.\n\nIn truth no credible opposition candidate was allowed to stand.\n\nSupporters of dead Putin critic Alexei Navalny did stage symbolic protests.\n\nTheir \"Noon against Putin\" initiative meant that long queues of voters formed at midday in Russian cities including Moscow and St Petersburg and in even greater numbers outside many embassies abroad, but it was never going to have any impact on the result.\n\nMonitoring group OVD-Info said at least 80 Russians were arrested. There was no repeat of the sporadic attacks on some polling stations that happened on Friday.\n\nWestern countries lined up to condemn the vote as neither free nor fair.\n\nGermany called it a \"pseudo-election\" under an authoritarian ruler reliant on censorship, repression and violence.\n\nUK Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron condemned \"the illegal holding of elections on Ukrainian territory\".\n\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said \"the Russian dictator is simulating another election\".\n\nIn the words of Navalny ally Leonid Volkov, savagely beaten with a meat hammer in exile in Lithuania last week: \"The percentages drawn for Putin have, of course, not the slightest relation to reality.\"\n\nRussians had three days to vote and people in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine had even longer, in an attempt to persuade residents to take part.\n\nOne election commission official was reported killed in the occupied town of Berdyansk on Sunday and residents spoke of pro-Russian collaborators going from home to home with ballot boxes accompanied by armed soldiers.\n\nAnadolu/Getty Images Officials said turnout was greater than 74% in the election\n\nBut on Russia's carefully controlled state TV channels the result was hailed as a triumph.\n\n\"This is an incredible level of support and unity around the figure of Vladimir Putin,\" said one correspondent excitedly, \"and a signal to Western countries\".\n\nPresident Putin was more subdued as he took questions from reporters, but he did hail Russia's presidential campaign as far more advanced than the US, citing Russia's use of online voting, which officials said brought in eight million voters.\n\nMr Putin had earlier been filmed performing a single keystroke to exercise his democratic right.\n\n\"It's transparent and absolutely objective,\" he suggested, \"not like in the US with mail-in voting... you can buy a vote for $10\".\n\nThe Russian leader made the same false claim about US elections earlier this year but never offered any evidence.\n\nMeanwhile, independent Russian watchdog Golos, which has been branded a foreign agent, said that Russia had never before \"seen a presidential campaign that fell so far short of constitutional standards\".\n\nVladimir Putin is now set to stay in power until at least 2030, and has ruled Russia since 2000 - the longest-serving Kremlin leader since Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin.\n\nGolos was barred from observing the vote but reports of irregularities have emerged, as well as pressure on public sector employees to vote either in polling stations or online.\n\nVoters were not able \"to form and express their free will, or to establish the true outcome of the vote\", it said.\n\nPresident Putin praised opposition campaigners for encouraging voters to turn out in greater numbers, although he condemned those who spoilt their ballots and said action would be taken against them.\n\nFor the first time he referred to Alexei Navalny by name, a month after his most vocal critic died in a penal colony inside the Arctic Circle.\n\nIn a remark possibly aimed at rebutting widespread allegations that he had Navalny killed, Mr Putin confirmed reports that he had explored exchanging him for prisoners held in the West, but on the condition that his rival never returned.\n\n\"I said I'm for it but, unfortunately, what happened happened. What can you do? That's life.\"\n\nYulia Navalnaya described queuing for six hours outside the Russian embassy in Berlin as part of the protest vote campaign. She said she had written her late husband's name on her ballot paper, and praised everyone who turned up, for giving her \"hope that everything is not in vain\".\n\nSean Gallup/Getty Images Yulia Navalnaya had backed calls for anti-Putin voters to turn up at polling stations at midday\n\nOne protest voter in London said she had queued for more than seven hours before casting her ballot.\n\nActivist and lawyer Lyubov Sobol said in Washington DC that the protest votes would not be reflected in the Kremlin's results, \"but this solidarity, this symbol, is nonetheless important\".\n\nRussia's presidential election was never going to be a level playing field. The Kremlin tightly controls the political system, the media and elections.\n\nCommunist Party candidate Nikolai Kharitonov managed little more than 4% of the vote and his fellow candidates even less.\n\nNone of the three were serious candidates and Mr Kharitonov even praised the president ahead of the election for \"trying to consolidate the nation for victory in all areas\".\n\nMillions of Russians will have voted for a fifth Putin presidential term partly because they see no credible alternative.\n\nBut that is purely because the Kremlin has removed any possible challenger from the political landscape. Opponents have either been jailed, or they have fled into exile, or they have lost their lives.",

        "text": "The Mexican Energy Sector after AMLO\nMexico's current administration, in its final stretch, will leave behind a legacy of a highly controversial and ideological energy policy that in practice halted the progress of the ambitious 2013 energy reform.\n\nNow, the country is gearing up for its largest-ever elections in 2024, and Claudia Sheinbaum, the candidate currently leading the polls, has declared her intention to continue the main policies of the AMLO administration, including a vision of the energy sector premised on the notion that the current government did not achieve all its energy policy objectives due to an \u201cinherited\u201d legal framework\u2014the energy reform of 2013\u2014that hindered the advancement of energy sovereignty goals. Recently the president has proposed a constitutional reform that dismantles, in part, the legal framework of 2013, to which Sheinbaum has expressed absolute support.\n\nIn this context, a review of Claudia Sheinbaum's academic and policy background on energy issues can help us understand the possible future scenarios that could be at play in the energy sector if she wins the presidency in June 2024. While these ideas may not necessarily materialize into public policy, they provide a scenario of how her perception of the sector has been shaped.\n\nWhat would be similar to and different from the current administration?\n\nFrom her writings and discourses, it is clear that Sheinbaum shares with AMLO the idea of having strong state-productive companies to promote energy supply security; that a national energy policy should encourage a low rate of energy imports, particularly emphasizing the dependence on foreign natural gas and fuel imports; and that private participation in the energy sector should be allowed but in second-order behind the state's role.\n\nOn hydrocarbons, Sheinbaum has criticized in the past multiple-service contracts in Pemex, the \u201cobsession\u201d with deep-water exploration at the expense of exploration and production in shallow waters, and the need to involve foreign companies in these activities. When it comes to electricity, Sheinbaum publicly backed AMLO's electricity reform initiative, particularly the idea of CFE becoming the main electricity generator in Mexico.\n\nSo where are the differences? Do they exist?\n\nOne area where Sheinbaum seems to differentiate from AMLO's views have to do with climate change and renewables. There, she has been a longtime advocate of the need for a broader diversification of Mexico\u00b4s energy matrix, with a specific focus on increasing the share of renewable energy sources, as well as a deeper commitment to the country's climate change goals where she has expressed the need for the country to be more ambitious. For example, during her tenure as Head of Mexico City, several of her government projects had a personal imprint toward these goals, although she never suggested in any way discomfort with AMLO's pro-hydrocarbon policies.\n\nHence, if one would want to foresee how a Sheinbaum energy policy would look if she becomes the next president of Mexico, the conclusion would have to be overall continuity with ideology continuing to shape many policy decisions, with some minor changes.\n\nHowever, despite any preconceived ideas about the energy sector that either Sheinbaum or X\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez could have about it, the inherited challenges that the next administration will face are far more complex than the one AMLO inherited in 2018. In a nutshell, Mexico faces increasing energy demand due to pent-up demand and nearshoring, coupled with insufficient investment in energy infrastructure, mainly for electricity transmission. There is also a significant dependence on US natural gas, oil production that has fallen instead of increasing as the administration promised, a deteriorating financial situation in Pemex and, widespread business distrust primarily caused by abrupt legislative and regulatory changes that halted investments and the function of market mechanisms, such as the oil rounds and electricity auctions.\n\nTherefore, in the end, no matter the ideological views any of the candidates have about energy, reality will play a critical force in shaping the route Mexico will follow in its always highly politicized energy sector.",

        "text": "\u201cIn some ways this election is unique in American history\u201d\n\u201cYes, the primaries continue until the beginning of June but both candidates have already secured a majority of the delegates to their party conventions.\u201d\n\nDoes this election so far differ from other American presidential elections?\n\n\u201cIn some ways this election is unique in American history. This is the first time a former president is facing criminal charges and several cases are in progress in parallel with his campaign to be re-elected as president. The legal proceedings that Trump is facing also give state and federal courts a very important role in this election.\n\nAccording to many observers, the survival of American democracy is at stake in this year\u2019s presidential election. Both the right and the left are warning of this danger. While the Democrats perceive democracy to be threatened by Trump, the Republicans argue that democracy is threatened by Biden.\n\nAnother factor that makes this year\u2019s election unusual is the age of the two candidates. Biden will be 81 and Trump 78 on election day. No matter which of them wins, he will be the oldest US President ever.\u201d\n\nHow will the election campaign continue now during the spring? Are there any special events we should watch out for?\n\n\u201cSince Biden and Trump have already won their party\u2019s nominations in reality, the upcoming primaries will not be particularly big events as such. Instead, the next important step will be the formal nominations at the party conventions, which will be held by the Republicans on 15\u201318 July and by the Democrats on 19\u201322 August.\n\nOne thing to keep an eye on is Trump\u2019s legal cases. Exactly how these will unfold is unclear, as Trump has appealed several of them. One important date is 22 April, when the Supreme Court will hold a hearing in the federal case on alleged electoral fraud. Trump\u2019s attempt to claim immunity in the case was dismissed by a court in Washington DC and the Supreme Court will now determine whether to uphold that judgment and if so whether the proceedings on electoral fraud can go ahead.\u201d\n\nWhich issues do you think will be most important to American voters?\n\n\u201cIn the midterm elections in 2022, it was primarily two issues that were decisive: a perceived threat to American democracy and abortion rights following the decision by the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade. As the Democrats fared considerably better than expected in the 2022 elections on the back of these two issues, they\u2019re likely to focus on them again in this year\u2019s presidential election.\n\nTwo other issues that will play a major role are immigration and the economy. As things stand, Trump has a certain advantage in opinion polls on both these issues. It will also be important to watch how Biden handles the war between Israel and Hamas. There is growing discontent here, particularly among Arab-American voters in states like Michigan that Biden can\u2019t afford to lose.\u201d\n\n\u00c5sa Malmberg",

        "text": "Middle-aged Americans lonelier than European counterparts\nWashington \u2014 Middle-aged adults in the U.S. tend to report significantly higher levels of loneliness than their European counterparts, possibly due in part to weaker family ties and greater income inequality, according to research published by the American Psychological Association.\n\n\u201cLoneliness is gaining attention globally as a public health issue because elevated loneliness increases one\u2019s risk for depression, compromised immunity, chronic illness and mortality,\u201d said lead author Frank Infurna, PhD, an associate professor of psychology at Arizona State University. \u201cOur research illustrates that people feel lonelier in some countries than in others during middle age. It also sheds light on reasons this may be occurring and how governments can address it with better policies.\u201d\n\nThe research was published in the journal American Psychologist.\n\nConsidering the increased public health focus in the United States (as evidenced by the surgeon general\u2019s 2023 advisory on the epidemic of loneliness and isolation) and abroad (countries such as the United Kingdom and Japan have appointed ministers to address the problem), the researchers explored how loneliness has historically changed over time and how it differs across countries.\n\nInfurna and his colleagues examined data from ongoing, nationally representative longitudinal surveys from the United States and 13 European countries, with more than 53,000 participants from three different generations (the Silent Generation, baby boomers and Generation X). Data were collected from 2002 to 2020 and only included responses given when participants were between the ages of 45 and 65.\n\n\u201cWe focused on middle-aged adults because they form the backbone of society and empirical evidence demonstrates that U.S. midlife health is lagging other industrialized nations,\u201d said Infurna. \u201cMiddle-aged adults carry much of society\u2019s load by constituting most of the workforce, while simultaneously supporting the needs of younger and older generations in the family.\u201d\n\nCompared with European counterparts, adults in the U.S. reported significantly higher levels of loneliness. This \u201cloneliness gap\u201d widened with younger generations (late baby boomers and Generation X) reporting greater loneliness than older ones (early baby boomers and the Silent Generation).\n\nWhile the U.S. showed consistent historical increases in midlife loneliness during the period data were collected, some European nations displayed more varied patterns. For instance, England and Mediterranean Europe demonstrated similar increases in loneliness for later-born participants (late baby boomers and Generation X). Continental and Nordic Europe demonstrated stable or even slightly declining levels across generations.\n\nThe study identified differences in cultural norms, socioeconomic influences and social safety nets between the U.S. and other European countries as potential explanations for the loneliness gap between the U.S. and Europe. Cultural norms in the U.S. are often characterized by individualism, increased social media use, declining social connections and increasing political polarization. The pressure faced by U.S. middle-aged adults is also further compounded by a higher residential mobility, weaker family ties, increasing job insecurity and income inequality. Additionally, social safety nets in the U.S. tend to be less comprehensive compared with some European nations regarding family leave, unemployment protection and childcare support.\n\n\u201cThe cross-national differences observed in midlife loneliness should alert researchers and policymakers to better understand potential root causes that can foster loneliness and policy levers that can change or reverse such trends,\u201d said Infurna.\n\nThe study also found that loneliness is generally on the rise compared with previous generations across both the U.S. and Europe, with Europe\u2019s numbers only slightly behind those of the United States.\n\nThe researchers said that loneliness as a public health issue requires policy interventions tailored to national contexts and generational shifts, including promoting family and work benefits, and reducing income inequality.\n\nLoneliness as a global public health issue has called attention to the importance of advancing social connections, according to Infurna. The study defends the promotion of social safety nets, through generous family and work policies, which may lessen midlife loneliness by reducing financial pressures and work-family conflict, in addition to strengthening job security and workplace flexibility. Infurna said such practices would also address health and gender inequities.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. surgeon general advisory report coupled with nations appointing ministers of loneliness have shined a bright light on loneliness being a global public health issue,\u201d he said. \u201cAs opposed to being considered an epidemic\u2014an outbreak that spreads rapidly and affects many individuals\u2014our findings paint a picture akin to loneliness being endemic, regularly occurring within an area or community.\u201d\n\nArticle: \u201cLoneliness in Midlife: Historical Increases and Elevated Levels in the United States Compared With Europe,\u201d by Frank J.

        "text": "Happiness Poll: Democrats, Biden Voters Report More Happiness Than GOP\nHappiness Poll: Democrats, Biden Voters Report More Happiness Than GOP\n\nVoters of the Democratic party and U.S. President Joe Biden are happier than voters for the Republican party, according to a new FAU PolCom and Mainstreet Research happiness poll.\n\nVoters of the Democratic party and U.S. President Joe Biden are happier than voters for the Republican party and former U.S. President Donald Trump, while older and wealthier adult voters are happier than younger and less-wealthy ones, according to a new Florida Atlantic University PolCom and Mainstreet Research happiness poll released today in advance of the United Nation\u2019s International Day of Happiness on March 20.\n\n\u201cHappiness is important to understand as it influences the well-being and satisfaction of citizens, which in turn shapes their voting behavior,\u201d said Carol Bishop Mills, Ph.D., FAU\u2019s communication professor, PolCom co-director, and expert in relational communication. \u201cAs demonstrated by Ronald Reagan\u2019s enduring question in the 1980 presidential election, \u2018Are you better off today than you were four years ago?\u2019 capturing public sentiment toward governance and policy efficacy is critical \u2013 especially in today\u2019s contentious political climate.\u201d\n\nThe Happiness Thermometer poll employed the well-established \u201cSatisfaction with Life Scale,\u201d developed by Ed Diener, et. al (1985), which uses five items that are designed to assess overall happiness. Through its application in the poll, the thermometer measures connections between happiness and politics, revealing measurable differences in happiness among age and economic groups, as well as party affiliation and voter intention.\n\nAmong the findings: 69 percent of Democratic voters reported they\u2019re at least \u201cslightly satisfied\u201d with their lives, while 66 percent of Republican respondents said they were so. Among voters who would vote for Biden in 2024, 75 percent answered that they were at least \u201cslightly satisfied\u201d with their lives, while 62 percent of Trump voters said the same.\n\n\u201cThis pattern highlights the importance of happiness not just as a personal pursuit but as an important predictor of voting behavior that harks back to Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1980s question,\u201d Mills said. \u201cAs seen in the connections between happiness and political intention, people who are content are more likely to support incumbents than people who do not feel happy.\u201d\n\nThe Kids are not Alright: People are Happy Overall; Younger People Aren\u2019t\n\nIn line with prevailing research in the field, most individuals surveyed reported a sense of contentment: 66 percent of respondents expressed satisfaction with their lives, with 22 percent reporting that they were \u201cextremely satisfied;\u201d 25 percent who were \u201csatisfied;\u201d and 19 percent who were \u201cslightly satisfied.\u201d Eighty-nine percent of people over 65 and nearly 67 percent of people ages 50 to 64 reported being \u201chappy.\u201d\n\nBut not all news is good. Roughly 56 percent of younger respondents 18 to 34 (millennials and Generation Z) indicated that they were \u201cdissatisfied\u201d with their lives, and only 21 percent of this age group indicated that they were \u201cextremely satisfied\u201d or \u201csatisfied.\u201d According to the poll, 49 percent voted Democrat in the 2020 presidential election and 42 percent voted Republican.\n\nThis response indicates that respondents\u2019 voter intentions mirror their emotional state. Reversing their previous voting behavior in the 2024 presidential election, 54 percent of likely voters in this age group indicated they would vote for Trump, while only 37 percent reported that they would vote for Biden. Among all voters in this age group, 50 percent indicated they would vote for Trump and 34 percent indicated they would vote for Biden.\n\n\u201cThis finding is important. Generally, young adults through the early 30s have high levels of happiness, bolstered by optimism, new experiences and independence. Then, happiness dips for mid-life periods and rebounds with the highest levels in adults over 50,\u201d Mills said. \u201cYoung people with high levels of unhappiness is noteworthy \u2013 and so is the level of satisfaction among older voters. We have seen a rise in depression, anxiety and mental health issues in the younger population, and it is important to take these concerns seriously.\u201d\n\nDemographic Variations Matter (in Happiness and Politics): Race, Income and Education\n\nMeaningful disparities in candidate support emerged across various demographic factors. Although it is said that money can\u2019t buy happiness, the data demonstrates that in some ways, it does. Of respondents making $50,000 or less, 62 percent indicated that they are happy, but 72 percent of respondents with incomes of more than $100,000 reported that they are happy. Economic dissatisfaction may be translating into support for Trump, as 50 percent of people making under $50,000 support Trump and 55 percent making over $100,000 support Biden.\n\nInterestingly in terms of race and ethnicity, white voters emerged as the group exhibiting the highest levels of life satisfaction, with a striking 70 percent indicating at least slight satisfaction. Meanwhile, Black voters demonstrated a satisfaction rate of 60 percent, while Hispanic voters reported 61 percent satisfaction.\n\n\u201cInscribed in the Declaration of Independence is that the pursuit of happiness is a fundamental right,\u201d said Luzmarina Garcia, Ph.D., assistant professor of political science at FAU. \u201cBut when we look at data, it\u2019s clear that people from different races and ethnicities don\u2019t always have the same levels of happiness in modern-day America.\u201d\n\nTight Presidential Contest Unfolds: Biden and Trump Locked, but Biden Gains\n\nThe FAU/Mainstreet poll also reveals a neck-and-neck competition between Biden and Trump in the forthcoming presidential elections, both among all voters and likely voters.\n\nIn response to the question, \u201cIf the election for president was held today, and candidates were Joe Biden and Donald Trump, which candidate would you support?\u201d voters demonstrated a striking split in their preferences, with 44 percent expressing support for Biden and 44 percent for Trump. Similarly, among likely voters, Biden slightly edged out Trump with 47 percent of support compared to Trump\u2019s 45 percent.\n\n\u201cThis difference falls within the margin of sampling error, rendering the presidential race too close to predict a definitive winner at this stage. Notably, a mere 4 percent of undecided likely voters underscore the tightness of the election,\u201d said Dukhong Kim, Ph.D., associate professor of political science at FAU.\n\nComparing these findings to the February poll, Biden has marginally improved his chances of securing victory. In February, he trailed Trump by 4 percent, indicating a subtle shift in voter sentiment within just a month. Additionally, the proportion of undecided voters has dwindled from 9 percent in February to 4 percent in March, further highlighting the competitiveness of the race.\n\nThe analysis is based on the results of a survey conducted Wednesday, March 15 to Friday, March 17 with a sample of 1,053 adults, 18 years of age or older, registered to vote, and living in the United States. The survey was conducted using text message recruitment and interactive voice response to complete the survey. The margin of error for the poll is +/- 3.0 percent at the 95 percent confidence level.

The index is designed to measure performance of the broad domestic economy through changes in the aggregate market value of 500 stocks representing all major industries.\n\nThe information presented is not intended to be making value judgments on the preferred outcome of any government decision or political election.\n\nKey Risks\n\n\n\nThis material is for informational purposes only, and may inform you of certain products and services offered by private banking businesses, part of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (\u201cJPM\u201d). Products and services described, as well as associated fees, charges and interest rates, are subject to change in accordance with the applicable account agreements and may differ among geographic locations. Not all products and services are offered at all locations. If you are a person with a disability and need additional support accessing this material, please contact your J.P. Morgan team or email us at accessibility.support@jpmorgan.com for assistance. Please read all Important Information.\n\nGeneral Risks & Considerations\n\nAny views, strategies or products discussed in this material may not be appropriate for all individuals and are subject to risks. Investors may get back less than they invested, and past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results. Asset allocation/diversification does not guarantee a profit or protect against loss. Nothing in this material should be relied upon in isolation for the purpose of making an investment decision. You are urged to consider carefully whether the services, products, asset classes (e.g., equities, fixed income, alternative investments, commodities, etc.) or strategies discussed are suitable to your needs. You must also consider the objectives, risks, charges, and expenses associated with an investment service, product or strategy prior to making an investment decision. For this and more complete information, including discussion of your goals/situation, contact your J.P. Morgan team.\n\nNon-Reliance\n\nCertain information contained in this material is believed to be reliable; however, JPM does not represent or warrant its accuracy, reliability or completeness, or accept any liability for any loss or damage (whether direct or indirect) arising out of the use of all or any part of this material. No representation or warranty should be made with regard to any computations, graphs, tables, diagrams or commentary in this material, which are provided for illustration/ reference purposes only. The views, opinions, estimates and strategies expressed in this material constitute our judgment based on current market conditions and are subject to change without notice. JPM assumes no duty to update any information in this material in the event that such information changes. Views, opinions, estimates and strategies expressed herein may differ from those expressed by other areas of JPM, views expressed for other purposes or in other contexts, and this material should not be regarded as a research report. Any projected results and risks are based solely on hypothetical examples cited, and actual results and risks will vary depending on specific circumstances. Forward-looking statements should not be considered as guarantees or predictions of future events.\n\nNothing in this document shall be construed as giving rise to any duty of care owed to, or advisory relationship with, you or any third party. Nothing in this document shall be regarded as an offer, solicitation, recommendation or advice (whether financial, accounting, legal, tax or other) given by J.P. Morgan and/or its officers or employees, irrespective of whether or not such communication was given at your request. J.P. Morgan and its affiliates and employees do not provide tax, legal or accounting advice. You should consult your own tax, legal and accounting advisors before engaging in any financial transactions.\n\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR INVESTMENTS AND POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST\n\nConflicts of interest will arise whenever JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or any of its affiliates (together, \u201cJ.P. Morgan\u201d) have an actual or perceived economic or other incentive in its management of our clients\u2019 portfolios to act in a way that benefits J.P. Morgan. Conflicts will result, for example (to the extent the following activities are permitted in your account): (1) when J.P. Morgan invests in an investment product, such as a mutual fund, structured product, separately managed account or hedge fund issued or managed by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or an affiliate, such as J.P. Morgan Investment Management Inc.; (2) when a J.P. Morgan entity obtains services, including trade execution and trade clearing, from an affiliate; (3) when J.P. Morgan receives payment as a result of purchasing an investment product for a client\u2019s account; or (4) when J.P. Morgan receives payment for providing services (including shareholder servicing, recordkeeping or custody) with respect to investment products purchased for a client\u2019s portfolio. Other conflicts will result because of relationships that J.P. Morgan has with other clients or when J.P. Morgan acts for its own account.\n\nInvestment strategies are selected from both J.P. Morgan and third-party asset managers and are subject to a review process by our manager research teams. From this pool of strategies, our portfolio construction teams select those strategies we believe fit our asset allocation goals and forward-looking views in order to meet the portfolio\u2019s investment objective.\n\nAs a general matter, we prefer J.P. Morgan managed strategies. We expect the proportion of J.P. Morgan managed strategies will be high (in fact, up to 100 percent) in strategies such as, for example, cash and high-quality fixed income, subject to applicable law and any account-specific considerations.\n\nWhile our internally managed strategies generally align well with our forward-looking views, and we are familiar with the investment processes as well as the risk and compliance philosophy of the firm, it is important to note that J.P. Morgan receives more overall fees when internally managed strategies are included. We offer the option of choosing to exclude J.P. Morgan managed strategies (other than cash and liquidity products) in certain portfolios.\n\nThe Six Circles Funds are U.S.-registered mutual funds managed by J.P. Morgan and sub-advised by third parties. Although considered internally managed strategies, JPMC does not retain a fee for fund management or other fund services.\n\nLegal Entity, Brand & Regulatory Information\n\nIn the United States, bank deposit accounts and related services, such as checking, savings and bank lending, are offered by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Member FDIC.\n\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its affiliates (collectively \u201cJPMCB\u201d) offer investment products, which may include bank-managed investment accounts and custody, as part of its trust and fiduciary services. Other investment products and services, such as brokerage and advisory accounts, are offered through J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (\u201cJPMS\u201d), a member of FINRA and SIPC. Insurance products are made available through Chase Insurance Agency, Inc. (CIA), a licensed insurance agency, doing business as Chase Insurance Agency Services, Inc. in Florida. JPMCB, JPMS and CIA are affiliated companies under the common control of JPM. Products not available in all states.\n\nIn Germany, this material is issued by J.P.

        "text": "The Mexican Energy Sector after AMLO\nMexico's current administration, in its final stretch, will leave behind a legacy of a highly controversial and ideological energy policy that in practice halted the progress of the ambitious 2013 energy reform.\n\nNow, the country is gearing up for its largest-ever elections in 2024, and Claudia Sheinbaum, the candidate currently leading the polls, has declared her intention to continue the main policies of the AMLO administration, including a vision of the energy sector premised on the notion that the current government did not achieve all its energy policy objectives due to an \u201cinherited\u201d legal framework\u2014the energy reform of 2013\u2014that hindered the advancement of energy sovereignty goals. Recently the president has proposed a constitutional reform that dismantles, in part, the legal framework of 2013, to which Sheinbaum has expressed absolute support.\n\nIn this context, a review of Claudia Sheinbaum's academic and policy background on energy issues can help us understand the possible future scenarios that could be at play in the energy sector if she wins the presidency in June 2024. While these ideas may not necessarily materialize into public policy, they provide a scenario of how her perception of the sector has been shaped.\n\nWhat would be similar to and different from the current administration?\n\nFrom her writings and discourses, it is clear that Sheinbaum shares with AMLO the idea of having strong state-productive companies to promote energy supply security; that a national energy policy should encourage a low rate of energy imports, particularly emphasizing the dependence on foreign natural gas and fuel imports; and that private participation in the energy sector should be allowed but in second-order behind the state's role.\n\nOn hydrocarbons, Sheinbaum has criticized in the past multiple-service contracts in Pemex, the \u201cobsession\u201d with deep-water exploration at the expense of exploration and production in shallow waters, and the need to involve foreign companies in these activities. When it comes to electricity, Sheinbaum publicly backed AMLO's electricity reform initiative, particularly the idea of CFE becoming the main electricity generator in Mexico.\n\nSo where are the differences? Do they exist?\n\nOne area where Sheinbaum seems to differentiate from AMLO's views have to do with climate change and renewables. There, she has been a longtime advocate of the need for a broader diversification of Mexico\u00b4s energy matrix, with a specific focus on increasing the share of renewable energy sources, as well as a deeper commitment to the country's climate change goals where she has expressed the need for the country to be more ambitious. For example, during her tenure as Head of Mexico City, several of her government projects had a personal imprint toward these goals, although she never suggested in any way discomfort with AMLO's pro-hydrocarbon policies.\n\nHence, if one would want to foresee how a Sheinbaum energy policy would look if she becomes the next president of Mexico, the conclusion would have to be overall continuity with ideology continuing to shape many policy decisions, with some minor changes.\n\nHowever, despite any preconceived ideas about the energy sector that either Sheinbaum or X\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez could have about it, the inherited challenges that the next administration will face are far more complex than the one AMLO inherited in 2018. In a nutshell, Mexico faces increasing energy demand due to pent-up demand and nearshoring, coupled with insufficient investment in energy infrastructure, mainly for electricity transmission. There is also a significant dependence on US natural gas, oil production that has fallen instead of increasing as the administration promised, a deteriorating financial situation in Pemex and, widespread business distrust primarily caused by abrupt legislative and regulatory changes that halted investments and the function of market mechanisms, such as the oil rounds and electricity auctions.\n\nTherefore, in the end, no matter the ideological views any of the candidates have about energy, reality will play a critical force in shaping the route Mexico will follow in its always highly politicized energy sector.",

He said it had come \"too slow and too late\".\n\nHe also emphasised that he had advised top American officials that the US \"needed to maintain a minimum force of 2,500 troops on the ground\" in order to prevent the Taliban from seizing control.\n\n\"Without this support, it was my view at the time, that it was a matter of 'when, not if' the Afghan government would collapse and the Taliban would take control,\" said Mr Milley.\n\nAfghanistan President Ashraf Ghani's decision to flee the country as the Taliban marched toward Kabul was then \"the straw that broke the camel's back\", he said.\n\nStill, both men maintained that no single factor alone had led to the US failure in Afghanistan, and they seemed to support the idea that the US should review the entire 20-year history of the conflict, not just its conclusion - a point supported by Democrats.\n\n\"We helped build an army, a state, but we could not build a nation,\" Mr Milley said, calling the outcome a \"strategic failure\".\n\nThey also acknowledged that remaining in Afghanistan would probably have put American troops in harm's way, as the Taliban would have restarted its fight with the US for staying on beyond an agreed 31 August departure deadline, Mr McKenzie said, citing intelligence reports he had reviewed.\n\nBoth men said the Taliban, which they characterised as a terrorist organisation, harboured militants who wished to target the US.\n\n\"They themselves [the Taliban] don't have a desire to attack us and our homeland, but they do harbour entities and organisations that do have a desire to do that,\" Mr McKenzie said.\n\nGetty Images\n\nFamily members of American soldiers who died in the suicide blast at the Kabul airport and others who served in Afghanistan attended the hearing. They watched as the former military leaders gave their sober assessments about the US withdrawal.\n\nAs it was the two retired generals' first time testifying since leaving the service, both were able to be more candid in their criticisms of US civilian officials and policymakers.\n\nMuch of their criticism was directed at the US Department of State for not issuing the order to evacuate American civilians months earlier.\n\nMr McKenzie and Mr Milley both testified that the US still did not know how many Americans were in Afghanistan, and it remains unclear how many were able to safely get out.\n\nWhile much of the hearing rehashed old arguments made by Democrats and Republicans, there was some bipartisan news welcomed by lawmakers in the room.\n\nMichael McCaul, the Republican chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, announced that the White House and Congressional leaders had agreed to grant 12,000 more special immigrant visas for Afghan nationals who assisted the US.\n\nHe said it would be included in a budget deal that is expected to pass this week.\n\nVeterans of the war in Afghanistan and lawmakers have been fighting to expand the number of visas for Afghanistan immigrants, as only about 7,000 remained. The US has issued about 1,000 per month recently, raising fears that they could run out.\n\nUS troops pulled out of Afghanistan after 20 years - the country's longest ever war - and it left many Afghans who supported American forces in danger, particularly as viable exits from the country closed.\n\nThe violent withdrawal dented perceptions of Mr Biden's international competence. Republicans have since seized on the failed exit as key line of attack ahead of the November presidential election.\n\nThe Biden administration and Democrats have regularly blamed Donald Trump for negotiating the agreement with the Taliban that led to the withdrawal, arguing that his decisions \"severely constrained\" Mr Biden's options.\n\nA government watchdog found that both administrations were to blame for the disastrous withdrawal that saw Afghan forces overwhelmed.",

        "text": "Risk assessment of the 2024 US elections\nWe have assessed the risk associated with the different political and economic approaches of Joe Biden and Donald Trump. On November 5, Americans will go to the polls for a historic presidential election.\n\nEvaluation of Risks Surrounding the 2024 US Elections\n\nCoface economists have evaluated the risks pertaining to the outcome of the US elections on November 5 in an internal analysis. The 2024 election in the USA is likely to be incredibly tight and increase political uncertainty. Reference is first made to the fact that the congressional elections coinciding with the presidential election constitute an additional factor of uncertainty. This is reflected in the fact that Congress has been split since the mid-term elections in 2022, with the Republican Party controlling the House of Representatives and the Democrats enjoying a majority in the Senate, which consequently restricts the President\u2019s ability to act.\n\nExamination of Key Policy Areas\n\nThe economists of the Coface economics department focus on five main areas: industrial and climate policy, fiscal policy, trade policy, competition between the USA and China, and foreign policy. In terms of industrial and climate policy, Coface identifies a risk in connection with the fact that Trump has announced that he will eliminate tax incentives for clean energy. For Biden, however, these will remain a priority. Regarding fiscal policy, the report states that both candidates are likely to seek to bring significantly increased budget deficits under control. To this end, Biden would try to increase corporation tax, in addition to the rate of taxation on high-income households. In contrast, for his part, Trump is likely to try to extend tax cuts. In terms of trade policy, neither candidate is keen to get behind free trade agreements. Trump has even raised the possibility of a blanket tariff of 10 percent on all US imports.\n\nForeign Policy Outlook\n\nOn the subject of the competition between the USA and China, the economists talk of \u201cout-competing China\u201d, which is likely to remain a key focus of US foreign policy regardless of who emerges victorious in November. All signs point to foreign policy being one of the biggest points of difference between the two administrations. Biden would be keen to restore a multilateral approach and re-establish traditional alliances. However, Trump\u2019s recent criticism of NATO and countries that are failing to meet the 2 percent of GDP rule on defense spending would seem to suggest a less cooperative approach with traditional allies of the USA.",

        "text": "El Salvador\u2019s president pledges continued fight against gang violence\nThe smallest country in Central America, El Salvador has been defined by its poverty, corruption, and gang-led violence. This has led millions of its residents to leave for safer countries, including the United States.\n\nIn 2019, Nayib Bukele, a businessman and former mayor of the country\u2019s capital San Salvador, was elected president with the promise of transforming the country and invigorating the stagnant economy.\n\nHis tactics for eradicating the gang violence included establishing a continued state of emergency that has led to the incarceration of tens of thousands of suspected gang members, news reports said.\n\nHuman rights organizations claim that this continued state of emergency has allowed for thousands of innocent victims to be jailed without any legal recourse. On Feb. 4, Bukele was reelected with 83 percent of the vote. Some call him a \u201cpopular dictator.\u201d\n\nJohn Twichell, a lecturer and director of Latin American Studies at the University of Miami College of Arts and Sciences, sheds light on what lies ahead for El Salvador.\n\nWhat is the political situation in El Salvador right now?\n\nPolitics in El Salvador hinges on national and citizen security, partly because of decades of gang violence and organized crime, and partly because Nayib Bukele has skillfully securitized Salvadoran politics to further his own authority and incumbency.\n\nUnder Bukele\u2019s leadership since 2019, El Salvador\u2019s number of incarcerated has dramatically risen to an estimated 105,000, or 1.7 percent of the 6.3 million population.\n\nIn parallel, under its leadership, the Bukele government has reduced the national homicide rate from the alarming 105 per 100,000 residents (in 2015) down to the current 8 murders per 100,000 residents, which is equal to that of the U.S.\n\nAs indicated by the presidential election outcome, the electorate approves of the results brought by Bukele\u2019s \u201claw and order\u201d or \u201cmano dura\u201d policies on crime and violence while they have up to now apparently been willing to overlook the associated broad curbing of\u2014and many particular cases of violations of\u2014human rights.\n\nYet, beyond a divided political opposition, there is noticeable resistance to Bukele\u2019s securitization of crime and gangs, and his ostensible rule by decree since 2022.\n\nInternational nongovernmental organizations, or NGOs, are at the forefront of civil society actors challenging Bukele\u2019s methods in restoring security in El Salvador. The number of academics and family members of those imprisoned merely on suspicion of crimes is also growing, accompanied by mounting domestic and international criticism of the harsh strategies and tactics tied to Bukele\u2019s ongoing rule by decree.\n\nThe question is how long the vast majority of Salvadorans will continue to back Bukele\u2019s strongman approach to governing. In the short-term, it appears the majority of the electorate dismisses such criticisms and outcries, apparently more satisfied by increased safety, economic prosperity, and a greater sense of a return to normalcy on the streets of their neighborhoods.\n\nPresident Nayib Bukele is seen by many as an authoritarian dictator. How did he get this reputation?\n\nBukele is a millennial whose previous career was as a publicist and media expert; this is someone who knows the ropes of both politics and social media and what it takes to master digital platforms to promote narratives that serve Bukele\u2019s own interests and those of his New Ideas party. He unabashedly dares others to provoke him on Twitter (X), with his previous profile header proclaiming himself to be \u201cel dictador m\u00e1s cool del mundo mundial\u201d which translates to \u201cthe world\u2019s coolest dictator,\u201d recently updated to \"Philosopher King.\"\n\nIn 2022, Bukele declared a state of emergency to address issues of crime and violence, and as noted above, that decree remains in place today. The decree suspended such civil rights as due process and public assembly, while granting the government extraordinary powers to surveil, arrest, and imprison suspected criminals.\n\nThe legislative assembly, currently controlled by Bukele\u2019s New Ideas party, in 2023 passed judicial reforms granting prosecutors the ability to conduct mass trials\u2014of as many as 900 persons\u2014among those imprisoned as \u201cterrorists\u201d on suspicion of crimes. The mass trials have provoked outrage among those near and far, resistant to Bukele\u2019s manipulation of democratic institutions previously set up to regulate the exercise of power.\n\nThis, plus the perceived unconstitutionality of his reelection bid\u2014in 2021, the Supreme Court overturned a 2014 reaffirming vote of El Salvador\u2019s constitution which prohibits immediate presidential reelection\u2014have earned Bukele a reputation he is outwardly proud of; that of an authoritarian dictator.\n\nHe has won the presidential election, and his party rules the Congress. What makes him so popular?\n\nBukele and his New Ideas party went into last month\u2019s election with the decreased crime and citizen security data, to point to and take credit for, along with other policies and programs such as the Centers for Urban Wellbeing and Opportunities (CUBOs) aimed at local community socioeconomic development, empowerment, and inclusion, 12 of which are now up and running, nearly halfway to achieving the goal of building 30.\n\nSuch data and initiatives aimed at delivering the goods have definitely contributed to New Ideas\u2019 consolidation of single party rule in El Salvador. Equally significant in this case is the broader anti-establishment trend in politics throughout the Caribbean and Latin America, upheld going into last month\u2019s election. While Bukele and New Ideas were the incumbent in that race, they are still considered anti-establishment in contrast to the center-right ARENA and left-wing FMLN, both of which presented candidates, but neither of which were competitive, due in part to voter perceptions of ARENA and FMLN as being historically corrupt and inept.\n\nAs for its popularity, leading up to last month\u2019s election, New Ideas cleverly harnessed state-run media and social media platforms to promote false choice narratives between its own policies and those of the opposition. For example, New Ideas claimed that if the opposition were to win the presidency, they would set free all imprisoned suspected criminals, thus returning El Salvador to its crime-ridden and violent times of a decade ago that most voters still vividly recall. In the eyes of a steadfastly loyal base, Bukele and New Ideas have delivered results in fighting crime and insecurity on the streets of El Salvador, restoring a sense of normalcy to the lives of everyday Salvadorans.\n\nCould Bukele\u2019s strong hand toward crime be exported to other countries in the region?\n\nAs the nature of transnationally-linked organized crime and the violence tied to it continues to threaten the security of Caribbean and Latin American countries, there does appear to be a growing regional diffusion effect brought about by an envy of sorts of the beneficial short-term results of Bukele\u2019s strongman approach to insecurity, whereby confounded political leaders and candidates running in elections to replace them are, at least in rhetorical terms, promising to go the way of Bukele in their own efforts to address spreading problems of drug and human trafficking combined with gang violence.\n\nYet, as the outcome of Guatemala\u2019s 2023 presidential election in which even the left-leaning candidate Sandra Torres vowed to adopt Bukele\u2019s approach to crime prevention illustrates, each country\u2019s politics is unique, with the majority of Guatemalans ultimately favoring Torres\u2019 runoff opponent Bernardo Arevalo in a race determined more by Arevalo\u2019s promise to end corruption, with Torres having been perceived as an archetype of that corruption.\n\nMoreover, as we see in the case of state failure in Haiti, a distinction must be made by political leaders and the international community between situations of organized violence that call for exercise of the rule of law and justice as opposed to military responses\u2014with the case in Haiti now tending toward the latter even though gangs are still Haiti\u2019s greatest threat.\n\nSo, all of this is to say that while the case of El Salvador and Bukele\u2019s handling of the security situation there may be an attractive example for politicians elsewhere in the region to aspire to, the likelihood that any rhetoric they deploy being converted into actionable policy would face countless contextual challenges.\n\nHave government policies helped the economy of the country?\n\nYes, Bukele\u2019s draconian law and order security policies and the targeting of gangs have yielded some positive economic results for El Salvador over the past three years.\n\nOne of the most immediate economic results of the eradication of gang activity has been the elimination of rampant extortion\u2014whereby gang members would, on a daily basis, collect tolls from and force other forms of \u201cprotection\u201d upon nearly all everyday Salvadorans in exchange for payments\u2014which posed a huge drag on the economy.\n\nFree of extortion threats in an environment of restored and relative public safety, there are renewed signs of local businesses opening. That, combined with El Salvador\u2019s rebound as a destination of international tourism, has generated a favorable influx of foreign currency to the benefit of the government and broader economy. Still, the apparent tradeoffs are stark if one considers the limits to civil liberties and human rights being imposed to breathe new life into El Salvador\u2019s economy.",

        "text": "Happiness Poll: Democrats, Biden Voters Report More Happiness Than GOP\nHappiness Poll: Democrats, Biden Voters Report More Happiness Than GOP\n\nVoters of the Democratic party and U.S. President Joe Biden are happier than voters for the Republican party, according to a new FAU PolCom and Mainstreet Research happiness poll.\n\nVoters of the Democratic party and U.S. President Joe Biden are happier than voters for the Republican party and former U.S. President Donald Trump, while older and wealthier adult voters are happier than younger and less-wealthy ones, according to a new Florida Atlantic University PolCom and Mainstreet Research happiness poll released today in advance of the United Nation\u2019s International Day of Happiness on March 20.\n\n\u201cHappiness is important to understand as it influences the well-being and satisfaction of citizens, which in turn shapes their voting behavior,\u201d said Carol Bishop Mills, Ph.D., FAU\u2019s communication professor, PolCom co-director, and expert in relational communication. \u201cAs demonstrated by Ronald Reagan\u2019s enduring question in the 1980 presidential election, \u2018Are you better off today than you were four years ago?\u2019 capturing public sentiment toward governance and policy efficacy is critical \u2013 especially in today\u2019s contentious political climate.\u201d\n\nThe Happiness Thermometer poll employed the well-established \u201cSatisfaction with Life Scale,\u201d developed by Ed Diener, et. al (1985), which uses five items that are designed to assess overall happiness. Through its application in the poll, the thermometer measures connections between happiness and politics, revealing measurable differences in happiness among age and economic groups, as well as party affiliation and voter intention.\n\nAmong the findings: 69 percent of Democratic voters reported they\u2019re at least \u201cslightly satisfied\u201d with their lives, while 66 percent of Republican respondents said they were so. Among voters who would vote for Biden in 2024, 75 percent answered that they were at least \u201cslightly satisfied\u201d with their lives, while 62 percent of Trump voters said the same.\n\n\u201cThis pattern highlights the importance of happiness not just as a personal pursuit but as an important predictor of voting behavior that harks back to Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1980s question,\u201d Mills said. \u201cAs seen in the connections between happiness and political intention, people who are content are more likely to support incumbents than people who do not feel happy.\u201d\n\nThe Kids are not Alright: People are Happy Overall; Younger People Aren\u2019t\n\nIn line with prevailing research in the field, most individuals surveyed reported a sense of contentment: 66 percent of respondents expressed satisfaction with their lives, with 22 percent reporting that they were \u201cextremely satisfied;\u201d 25 percent who were \u201csatisfied;\u201d and 19 percent who were \u201cslightly satisfied.\u201d Eighty-nine percent of people over 65 and nearly 67 percent of people ages 50 to 64 reported being \u201chappy.\u201d\n\nBut not all news is good. Roughly 56 percent of younger respondents 18 to 34 (millennials and Generation Z) indicated that they were \u201cdissatisfied\u201d with their lives, and only 21 percent of this age group indicated that they were \u201cextremely satisfied\u201d or \u201csatisfied.\u201d According to the poll, 49 percent voted Democrat in the 2020 presidential election and 42 percent voted Republican.\n\nThis response indicates that respondents\u2019 voter intentions mirror their emotional state. Reversing their previous voting behavior in the 2024 presidential election, 54 percent of likely voters in this age group indicated they would vote for Trump, while only 37 percent reported that they would vote for Biden. Among all voters in this age group, 50 percent indicated they would vote for Trump and 34 percent indicated they would vote for Biden.\n\n\u201cThis finding is important. Generally, young adults through the early 30s have high levels of happiness, bolstered by optimism, new experiences and independence. Then, happiness dips for mid-life periods and rebounds with the highest levels in adults over 50,\u201d Mills said. \u201cYoung people with high levels of unhappiness is noteworthy \u2013 and so is the level of satisfaction among older voters. We have seen a rise in depression, anxiety and mental health issues in the younger population, and it is important to take these concerns seriously.\u201d\n\nDemographic Variations Matter (in Happiness and Politics): Race, Income and Education\n\nMeaningful disparities in candidate support emerged across various demographic factors. Although it is said that money can\u2019t buy happiness, the data demonstrates that in some ways, it does. Of respondents making $50,000 or less, 62 percent indicated that they are happy, but 72 percent of respondents with incomes of more than $100,000 reported that they are happy. Economic dissatisfaction may be translating into support for Trump, as 50 percent of people making under $50,000 support Trump and 55 percent making over $100,000 support Biden.\n\nInterestingly in terms of race and ethnicity, white voters emerged as the group exhibiting the highest levels of life satisfaction, with a striking 70 percent indicating at least slight satisfaction. Meanwhile, Black voters demonstrated a satisfaction rate of 60 percent, while Hispanic voters reported 61 percent satisfaction.\n\n\u201cInscribed in the Declaration of Independence is that the pursuit of happiness is a fundamental right,\u201d said Luzmarina Garcia, Ph.D., assistant professor of political science at FAU. \u201cBut when we look at data, it\u2019s clear that people from different races and ethnicities don\u2019t always have the same levels of happiness in modern-day America.\u201d\n\nTight Presidential Contest Unfolds: Biden and Trump Locked, but Biden Gains\n\nThe FAU/Mainstreet poll also reveals a neck-and-neck competition between Biden and Trump in the forthcoming presidential elections, both among all voters and likely voters.\n\nIn response to the question, \u201cIf the election for president was held today, and candidates were Joe Biden and Donald Trump, which candidate would you support?\u201d voters demonstrated a striking split in their preferences, with 44 percent expressing support for Biden and 44 percent for Trump. Similarly, among likely voters, Biden slightly edged out Trump with 47 percent of support compared to Trump\u2019s 45 percent.\n\n\u201cThis difference falls within the margin of sampling error, rendering the presidential race too close to predict a definitive winner at this stage. Notably, a mere 4 percent of undecided likely voters underscore the tightness of the election,\u201d said Dukhong Kim, Ph.D., associate professor of political science at FAU.\n\nComparing these findings to the February poll, Biden has marginally improved his chances of securing victory. In February, he trailed Trump by 4 percent, indicating a subtle shift in voter sentiment within just a month. Additionally, the proportion of undecided voters has dwindled from 9 percent in February to 4 percent in March, further highlighting the competitiveness of the race.\n\nThe analysis is based on the results of a survey conducted Wednesday, March 15 to Friday, March 17 with a sample of 1,053 adults, 18 years of age or older, registered to vote, and living in the United States. The survey was conducted using text message recruitment and interactive voice response to complete the survey. The margin of error for the poll is +/- 3.0 percent at the 95 percent confidence level. Margins of error are higher in each subsample.\n\nTo view the poll and report, www.faupolling.com/march-19-2024/ . For more information on FAU\u2019s PolComLab, visit www.faupolling.com\n\n-FAU-",

Nelson. \u201cThe United States, along with our allies and partners, remains steadfast in defending our democratic principles and the credibility of our elections.\u201dRUSSIAN FOREIGN MALIGN INFLUENCEMoscow employs an array of tools, including malign influence campaigns and illicit cyber activities, to undermine the interests of the United States and its allies and partners, including in Latin America, the Middle East, and Europe. Russia routinely uses its intelligence services, proxies, and influence tools in these efforts. Russia\u2019s influence actors have increasingly adapted their methods to hide their involvement by developing a vast ecosystem of Russian proxy websites, personas, and organizations which give the false appearance of being independent news sources.\u00a0Today\u2019s designations follow prior OFAC actions that have highlighted and disrupted Russia\u2019s global malign influence campaigns, which have included\u00a0U.S. election interference, efforts to subvert democracy in Moldova, destabilization activities in Ukraine, and\u00a0the operation of outlets controlled by Russian intelligence services,\u00a0among others.\u00a0\u00a0RUSSIAN AGENTS IMPLEMENTING THE KREMLIN\u2019S DIRECTIVES TO DECEIVE AUDIENCESIlya Andreevich Gambashidze (Gambashidze), the founder of the Moscow-based company Social Design Agency (SDA), together with Nikolai Aleksandrovich Tupikin (Tupikin), the CEO and current owner of Russia-based Company Group Structura LLC (Structura), were involved in a persistent foreign malign influence campaign at the direction of the Russian Presidential Administration. SDA\u00a0and Structura have been identified as key actors of the campaign, responsible for providing GoR with a variety of services, including the creation of websites designed to impersonate government organizations and legitimate media outlets in Europe.\u00a0Leading into Fall\u00a02022, Tupikin and Gambashidze implemented a campaign that impersonated news websites, staged videos, and fake social media accounts. Specifically, Tupikin and Gambashidze, via SDA and Structura, have implemented, on behalf of GoR, a sprawling network of over\u00a060 websites that impersonated legitimate news organizations, and which used misleading social media accounts to amplify the content of the spoofed websites. The fake websites appeared to have been built to carefully mimic the appearance of legitimate news websites. The fake websites included embedded images and working links to legitimate sites and even used the impersonated site\u2019s cookie acceptance page.\u00a0\u00a0Today, OFAC designated SDA\u00a0and Structura pursuant to E.O.\u00a014024 for being owned or controlled by, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, GoR.OFAC designated Gambashidze and Tupikin pursuant to E.O.\u00a014024 for being or having been a leader, official, senior executive officer, or member of the board of directors of SDA and Structura, respectively, persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O.\u00a014024.SANCTIONS IMPLICATIONSAs a result of today\u2019s action, all property and interests in property of the designated persons described above that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked and must be reported to OFAC. In addition, any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, individually or in the aggregate, 50 percent or more by one or more blocked persons are also blocked. Unless authorized by a general or specific license issued by OFAC, or exempt, OFAC\u2019s regulations generally prohibit all transactions by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in property of designated or otherwise blocked persons.\u00a0In addition, financial institutions and other persons that engage in certain transactions or activities with the sanctioned entities and individuals may expose themselves to sanctions or be subject to an enforcement action. The prohibitions include the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any designated person, or the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.\u00a0The power and integrity of OFAC sanctions derive not only from OFAC\u2019s ability to designate and add persons to the SDN List, but also from its willingness to remove persons from the SDN List consistent with the law. The ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish, but to bring about a positive change in behavior.\u00a0For information concerning the process for seeking removal from an OFAC list, including the SDN List, please refer to OFAC\u2019s Frequently Asked Question 897 here.\u00a0For detailed information on the process to submit a request for removal from an OFAC sanctions list, please click here.Click here for more information on the individuals and entities designated today.\u00a0###",

        "text": "2024 National Findings Report\nGlossary of terms\n\nCivic health: The degree to which citizens participate in their communities, from local and state governance to interactions with friends or family. Civic health relates to the overall well-being of neighborhoods, communities, states and the nation (National Conference on Citizenship 2023).\n\nCivic infrastructure: Places, policies, programs and practices that undergird strong communities and foster civic participation (Patrick and Brady 2015).\n\nCivic participation: The ways people participate in the life of a community in order to improve conditions and/or shape the community\u2019s future (Adler and Goggin 2016).\n\nCommunity power: The ability of communities most impacted by structural inequity to develop, sustain and grow an organized group of people who act together through democratic structures to set agendas, shift public discourse, influence who makes decisions and cultivate ongoing relationships of mutual accountability with decision-makers that change systems and advance health equity (Lead Local 2023).\n\nDemocracy: A form of government where citizens elect leaders to govern on their behalf.\n\nDigital redlining: The modern equivalent of this historical form of redlining creates and maintains technological policies, practices and investment decisions that enforce class boundaries and discriminate against specific populations. For example, this entails under-resourced broadband infrastructure in low-income and rural areas and neighborhoods, often with high proportion of people of color (Gilliard and Culik 2016).\n\nHealth equity: Assurance of the conditions for optimal health for all people. Achieving health equity requires valuing all individuals and populations equally, recognizing and rectifying historical injustice and providing resources according to need (Jones 2014).\n\nInformation environment: The space where people process information to make sense of the world. This includes the digital and non-digital resources that shape information flow and the conditions for people to access, process and absorb informatio(Center for Democracy & Technology n.d.).\n\nRedlining: The Federal Housing Administration\u2019s policies from the 1930s that entrenched racial residential segregation. Redlining denied Black people and some other ethnic groups access to government-insured mortgages and labeled homes in neighborhoods where Black people and some other ethnic groups lived as uninsurable, thereby guaranteeing that property values in those neighborhoods would be less than those in non-immigrant white neighborhoods (Mapping Inequality n.d.).\n\nRight-to-Work policies: These policies prohibit unions from collecting dues from non-unionized workers in otherwise unionized workplaces, which weakens the scope of collective action and deprives unions of funds to exert political influence to support workers (Frymer, Grumbach and Hill 2023).\n\nSocial solidarity: Emphasizes the interdependence between individuals in a society, which allows individuals to feel that they can enhance the lives of others. It is a core principle of collective action and is founded on shared values and beliefs among different groups in society (Douwes et al. 2018).\n\nStructural barriers: Obstacles that collectively affect a group disproportionately and perpetuate or maintain stark disparities in outcomes (American Hospital Association Institute for Diversity and Health Equity n.d.).\n\nStructural racism: Refers to the totality of ways in which societies foster racial discrimination through mutually reinforcing systems of housing, education, employment, earnings, benefits, credit, media, health care and criminal justice. These patterns and practices in turn reinforce discriminatory beliefs, values and distribution of resources (Bailey et al. 2017).\n\nFind more information and relevant readings on civic health.",

        "text": "Women Voters\u2019 Pivotal Role in Electing the Next U.S. President\nWomen voters will play a pivotal role in determining the outcome of the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Women comprise the largest group of registered voters, and they tend to turn out at high levels to vote, as 68.4 percent of them did in the 2020 election. The question is, where will women throw their weight?\n\nWhile former President Donald Trump is leading in many polls, the latest Quinnipiac poll shows President Joe Biden in a dead heat with Trump. In that poll, Biden captured 58 percent of the women\u2019s vote, a five-point gain over the last Quinnipiac poll in December. Trump\u2019s support from women declined by five points to 36 percent. That puts Biden ahead of his 2020 performance when he won 55 percent of the women\u2019s vote, compared to 44 percent of women who voted for Trump.\n\nBlack and Hispanic women voters provided Biden his winning edge in 2020, as 90 and 69 percent those blocs respectively voted for him. In contrast, Trump still retains the loyalty of a majority of white women, who form the largest single bloc of the electorate at 40 percent, and the largest subgroup of women voters.\n\nRenewing America Ideas and initiatives for renewing America\u2019s economic strength.

Trump\u2019s share of the white women vote in 2020 actually increased from 2016, when he garnered 39 percent. However, the recent South Carolina Republican primary indicated that Trump could be losing some of them. According to exit polls, a shocking 43 percent of women voted for Nikki Haley, despite the fact that Trump was widely forecast to win that contest by a significant margin. That signals a willingness to cast a protest vote against Trump (and likely some loyalty to their former state governor). Deep-red South Carolina will certainly not cross over to vote Democratic in November, but it may mean that some women are turned off enough by Trump to refrain from voting for him.\n\nWomen\u2019s rising discomfort with Trump could be due to several factors, including a jury finding him liable for sexual assault of E. Jean Carroll in a civil case and the imposition of an $88 million penalty by two juries. In addition, he continued to defame the plaintiff during and after the trial. He also repeatedly belittled and made racist and false comments about Haley, his own ambassador to the United Nations. Finally, the abortion issue could have opened a seam even in deep red South Carolina. While 51 percent of South Carolina Republicans support a total or near total abortion ban, significant differences could nonetheless exist\u2014including a reluctance to back a 15-week national abortion ban that Trump has pledged to seek. According to South Carolina exit polls, abortion was the top issue for 58 percent of those who voted for Haley, who has repeatedly warned her party that the votes for a national ban do not exist.\n\nIt has become clear that abortion rights are a significant issue animating voters in the battleground states that will determine the outcome of the election. The success of state-level measures defending abortion rights in Kansas, Michigan, Ohio, and elsewhere suggests that significant support for abortion and reproductive rights exist among women and men in red and purple states.\n\nAbortion is far from the only issue on women voters\u2019 minds, of course, although the stories of women facing life-threatening decisions continue to galvanize attention around the issue. Economic concerns predominate across the electorate, and younger voters in particular, including younger women, could choose not to vote for Biden over differences regarding his approach to the Israel-Hamas war. A third-party candidate in battleground states could also pose a significant challenge to Biden\u2019s reelection bid if the margins are close.\n\nAnother important subgroup is independent voters, who represent 43 percent of the total electorate; they are roughly divided between those who lean Republican and Democratic. The majority of independents identify as moderate or liberal, rather than conservative, including on social issues, according to the Pew Research Center. That suggests Biden could find some crossover votes if Republican leaners perceive Trump\u2019s positions as too extreme. He will certainly need to retain most of the Democratic leaners to win.\n\nBiden acknowledged the importance of women\u2019s votes in his State of the Union address, and the campaign is giving it new priority with Vice President Kamala Harris leading the charge.\n\nTurnout rates for women have a very good chance of reaching a historic high, not just due to the overturning of the fifty-year-old right to an abortion, but also because that ruling has been followed by an avalanche of actions that many women view as direct attacks on their rights and autonomy. These include state-level abortion bans and restrictions in twenty-four states, court rulings that prevent women from urgently needed abortions to protect their health, efforts to ban the abortion drug mifepristone and limit birth control, and laws that would prosecute women who leave states for abortion care and those who help them. The Alabama Supreme Court decision that frozen embryos are persons caused providers to suspend in vitro fertilization treatments. All of this could lead to a \u201cblue wave\u201d far exceeding the turnout in the 2022 midterms, and with it the possibility that the next president will owe his presidency to women turning out to express their views.\n\nThis post was written for the Council on Foreign Relations\u2019 Renewing America initiative\u2014an effort established on the premise that for the United States to succeed, it must fortify the political, economic, and societal foundations fundamental to its national security and international influence.

Mr Anies and Mr Ganjar got 25% and 16%, respectively.\n\nMr Prabowo thanked the popular Jokowi, whose tacit backing is widely believed to have helped him win. The former general lost two presidential elections to Mr Jokowi in 2014 and 2019.\n\nHis running mate - now the vice president-elect - is Mr Jokowi's eldest son, Gibran Rakabuming Raka, who was only able to run only after a last-minute lowering of a minimum age requirement.\n\nWatch: Prabowo Subianto danced as he claimed victory - unofficial counts put him well over the 50% vote mark\n\nMr Prabowo claimed victory after the election on 14 February when unofficial tallies showed he had a strong lead over his rivals. World leaders have also congratulated him over the past weeks.\n\nOn Wednesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken extended his \"sincere congratulations\" and applauded Indonesians for \"their robust turnout and commitment to democracy and the rule of law\".\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in a statement that he looked forward \"to deepening our strategic partnership even further\", a view echoed by the French foreign ministry.\n\nAnticipating protests from Mr Anies' and Mr Ganjar's supporters, police deployed more than 3,000 officers to stand guard across the capital city Jakarta before official results were announced.\n\nDemonstrators have taken to the streets in the past weeks alleging widespread election fraud.\n\nAmong other things, Mr Anies and Mr Ganjar had earlier alleged that Mr Gibran's candidacy was a part of behind-the-scenes manoeuvring that showed Mr Jokowi's partiality for the Prabowo-Gibran camp.\n\nMr Anies said on Wednesday that there had been election irregularities and that his legal team would take it to court.\n\n\"A leadership born out of a sullied process, with deviations, fraud, will produce a regime with unjust policies,\" Reuters news agency cited him as saying.\n\nThe head of Mr Ganjar's legal team had also told BBC Indonesia they would challenge the result in court. They have to do so within the next three days, according to the country's laws.\n\n\"There have been a lot of complaints about irregularities. This election in the Reformasi era is considered [by many] to be less free and fair than previous elections in the post-Suharto period,\" Indonesian professor Dewi Fortuna Anwar told the BBC's Newsday programme on Thursday.\n\nThe Reformasi, also known as the Reform era, began with the fall of Indonesia's authoritarian president Suharto in May 1998.\n\n\"Academics and civil society organisations throughout the country have been expressing concerns over [alleged] ethical and legal violations, and improper, or you might even say illegal, use of state resources,\" said Ms Dewi, a professor at the National Research and Innovation Agency in Indonesia.",

        "text": "Risk assessment of the 2024 US elections\nWe have assessed the risk associated with the different political and economic approaches of Joe Biden and Donald Trump. On November 5, Americans will go to the polls for a historic presidential election.\n\nEvaluation of Risks Surrounding the 2024 US Elections\n\nCoface economists have evaluated the risks pertaining to the outcome of the US elections on November 5 in an internal analysis. The 2024 election in the USA is likely to be incredibly tight and increase political uncertainty. Reference is first made to the fact that the congressional elections coinciding with the presidential election constitute an additional factor of uncertainty. This is reflected in the fact that Congress has been split since the mid-term elections in 2022, with the Republican Party controlling the House of Representatives and the Democrats enjoying a majority in the Senate, which consequently restricts the President\u2019s ability to act.\n\nExamination of Key Policy Areas\n\nThe economists of the Coface economics department focus on five main areas: industrial and climate policy, fiscal policy, trade policy, competition between the USA and China, and foreign policy. In terms of industrial and climate policy, Coface identifies a risk in connection with the fact that Trump has announced that he will eliminate tax incentives for clean energy. For Biden, however, these will remain a priority. Regarding fiscal policy, the report states that both candidates are likely to seek to bring significantly increased budget deficits under control. To this end, Biden would try to increase corporation tax, in addition to the rate of taxation on high-income households. In contrast, for his part, Trump is likely to try to extend tax cuts. In terms of trade policy, neither candidate is keen to get behind free trade agreements. Trump has even raised the possibility of a blanket tariff of 10 percent on all US imports.\n\nForeign Policy Outlook\n\nOn the subject of the competition between the USA and China, the economists talk of \u201cout-competing China\u201d, which is likely to remain a key focus of US foreign policy regardless of who emerges victorious in November. All signs point to foreign policy being one of the biggest points of difference between the two administrations. Biden would be keen to restore a multilateral approach and re-establish traditional alliances. However, Trump\u2019s recent criticism of NATO and countries that are failing to meet the 2 percent of GDP rule on defense spending would seem to suggest a less cooperative approach with traditional allies of the USA.",

        "text": "Who might Trump pick to be vice president? Here are 7 possibilities\nThe presidential primary season is over, and now that former President Donald Trump has secured the Republican nomination, he's getting questions about who's on his VP short list and what qualities he's looking for in a running mate.\n\nIn February, while the primaries were still underway, Trump told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo that he wasn't planning to announce his choice \"for awhile.\" He said he was looking for someone who's \"able to be a good president\" and told Bartiromo he had been talking to a number of people and mentioned South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem.\n\nIn January, he'd said of his potential running mate, \"I know who it's going to be,\" but offered no further detail.\n\nMost candidates don't announce a running mate until the official nominating conventions are held in the summer, and Trump is expected to follow that precedent. Sources close to the Trump campaign say they have advised Trump to withhold announcing the nomination until the convention to build suspense and increase his leverage over candidates vying for the role.\n\nPotential picks whom sources within Trump's orbit have discussed for the role have been prominently featured on the campaign trail with the former president. Here are seven of them.\n\nNew York Rep. Elise Stefanik\n\nFile: GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York smiles as she arrives to vote for the new GOP conference chairperson at the Capitol in Washington, D.C. on May 14, 2021. MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images\n\nNew York Rep. Elise Stefanik is one of Trump's fiercest defenders. As the No. 4 House Republican, she was one of the first members of Congress to endorse Trump when he announced his third bid for the White House.\n\nThirty-nine year-old Stefanik is almost half the age of Trump, who is 77 years old. She is seen as someone who would carry the torch for the MAGA movement he began and has fought for Trump on numerous occasions as a key member of his impeachment defense team in 2019.\n\nIn January, she echoed Trump's characterization of jailed Jan. 6 defendants as \"hostages,\" and she's filed multiple ethics complaints against judges in cases involving the former president. Stefanik was one of 147 Republicans who voted against certifying the 2020 election results.\n\nSources tell CBS News that Trump sees Stefanik as a potential running mate. When asked whether she would serve as his vice president, Stefanik told NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" that she would be \"honored to serve in any capacity in a Trump administration.\"\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Tim Scott\n\nFile: Sen. Tim Scott (R) (R-SC) shakes hands with Republican presidential candidate and former President Donald Trump during a campaign rally at the Grappone Convention Center on January 19, 2024 in Concord, New Hampshire. Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images\n\nThe South Carolina senator dodged questions about being Trump's vice president when he was running for president himself. He dropped his bid for the White House in November, and he endorsed Trump just before the New Hampshire primary in a blow to fellow South Carolinian and former Gov. Nikki Haley, who appointed him to a vacant U.S. Senate seat.\n\nTrump told Bartiromo that he had called Scott and told him, \"'You are a much better candidate for me than you are for yourself.'\"\n\n\"We need Donald Trump,\" Scott told a crowd of Trump supporters at a Jan. 19 rally in Concord, New Hampshire. \"We need a president who will unite our country.\"\n\nTrump praised Scott as a \"man of faith, courage and conviction, a man who fought for those opportunities zones like nobody would ever fight and school choice and also taking care of the historically black colleges.\"\n\nScott,the highest-ranking Black Republican in the GOP, could help Trump court Black voters, traditionally a key Democratic voting bloc.\n\nScott told \"CBS Mornings\" that he would never ask for a cabinet position from Trump, but declined to answer whether he wants to serve as Trump's vice president.\n\n\"The one thing I want to do is make sure we win in 2024,\" he told \"CBS Mornings\" anchor Gayle King, \"I don't think about this from a personal perspective.\"\n\nSouth Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem\n\nFile: South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem speaks at Calvin Coolidge Foundation conference at Library of Congress on Feb. 17, 2023 in Washington, D.C. Anna Moneymaker / Getty Images\n\nNoem has been fiercely loyal to Trump and has long been mentioned as a vice presidential candidate. Hailing from the red state of South Dakota, Noem considered a 2024 presidential run, but ultimately decided not to pursue it when Trump announced he was running again.\n\n\"I think he's gonna run. And if President Trump runs, I'll support him,\" Noem told CBS News' Major Garrett in 2022.\n\nShe rose to prominence in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic when she refused to implement strict mask mandates in South Dakota.\n\nNoem was one of the first governors to endorse Trump, announcing she was backing him at a rally last September, and she campaigned for him several times in Iowa before the January caucuses. Noem told Newsmax in September that she would consider the vice presidential slot \"in a heartbeat.\" She also has close ties to MAGA world and with former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski.\n\nNorth Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum\n\nFile: North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, former President Donald Trump, Kathryn Burgum, North Dakota's first lady, left, during campaign event at Simpson College in Indianola, Iowa, on Jan. 14, 2024. Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nNorth Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum \u2014 another former 2024 presidential candidate \u2014 has also been raised by the Trump campaign as a potential running mate. Burgum was the first of the former 2024 presidential candidates to officially endorse Trump, joining him for a rally in Indianola, Iowa, on Jan. 14, the eve of before the caucuses, to announce his support.\n\nThe Trump team likes Burgum, who refrained from saying anything negative about the former president when he was a candidate himself. Burgum is seen as a solid conservative with credentials that could be a good fit for various cabinet positions, including vice president.\n\n\"He's one of the best governors in our country, and I hope that I'm going to be able to call on him to be a piece of the administration, a very important piece of the administration,\" Trump said of Burgum during the Jan. 14 rally.\n\nAs governor, Burgum signed into law a six-week abortion ban and legislation to restrict transgender rights. He's also a fiscal hawk who has cut state spending while enacting the largest tax cut in North Dakota history. He's led North Dakota since 2016 and announced in January that he would not seek a third term as governor.\n\nArkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders\n\nFile: Sarah Huckabee Sanders at Republican Jewish Coalition, in Las Vegas, Nevada, Nov. 6, 2021. Bridget Bennett/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nThe former Trump administration official and current governor of Arkansas is another young, female conservative likely being considered by Trump for the ticket. Sanders, 41, is the youngest governor in the country and is seen as a rising star in the party who can speak to suburban women. Last year, Sanders delivered the Republican response to President Biden's State of the Union address. She officially endorsed Trump during a campaign rally in Hialeah, Florida, in November 2023.\n\nBut Sanders has dismissed the idea of serving as vice president. When asked by \"Face the Nation\" moderator Margaret Brennan if she'd say yes to joining the Trump ticket, Gov. Sanders said, \"I am honored to serve as governor, and I hope I get to do it for the next seven years.\"\n\nFormer HUD Secretary Dr. Ben Carson\n\nFile: Former HUD Secretary Ben Carson campaigns for former President Donald Trump at the Grace Baptist Church on January 11, 2024 in Marion, Iowa. Anna Moneymaker / Getty Images\n\nCarson, a renowned neurosurgeon and former secretary of Housing and Urban Development, was one of the longest-serving cabinet secretaries during Trump's administration. Carson remained loyal to the former president after Jan. 6, when several cabinet secretaries resigned in protest, citing the attack on the Capitol.\n\nCarson \u2014 who ran against Trump in the 2016 presidential primary \u2014 campaigned for the former president in Iowa before the caucuses. The devout Christian told a church full of Trump supporters to look less at Trump's words and more at what he has accomplished when voting for him.\n\n\"He's a strong believer. Now, sometimes that might not be reflected in his speech, but I always say, 'Isn't it better to look at what a person does?'\" Carson said.\n\nCarson is seen as someone who would be a safe choice for vice president, since he is well-liked by conservatives and Christians. In response to whether he and Trump have had discussions about serving as vice president, Carson said, \"I don't want to speak about private conversations.\"\n\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., speaks with members of the media as he walks, Wednesday, Feb. 28, 2024, at the Capitol in Washington. Mark Schiefelbein / AP\n\nThe senior senator from Florida \u2013 and ex-2016 presidential rival to Trump \u2013 is also under consideration as a potential running mate in 2024. Rubio, the son of two Cuban immigrants, is seen as someone who could help the campaign in appealing to Latino voters.\n\nRubio endorsed Trump the day before the Iowa caucuses in a post on X, and referenced working with Trump on the expanded Child Tax Credit and sanctions on Venezuela and Cuba during his presidency.\n\n\"I support Trump because that kind of leadership is the ONLY way we will get the extraordinary actions needed to fix the disaster Biden has created,\" Rubio wrote.\n\nIn an interview with Glenn Beck on March 21, Rubio said that he hadn't spoken to Trump or his campaign about being considered for vice president.\n\n\"The reason I'm in public service and the reason why I even ran for reelection \u2014 it's a six-year contract you sign when you come here \u2014 is I still want to save this country,\" Rubio said. \"I love this country with all my heart. It changed the life of my family and the trajectory of my family. I mean, I'm not saying that people whose families were born here don't love the country this well, but when your parents came from somewhere else, you realize that but for the grace of God and the existence of America, how different my life would have been. I think this country is in a lot, a lot of trouble.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time Rubio's been on the short list for vice president. The Florida senator was also a top contender to be on the ticket with Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP nominee. Romney ended up choosing then Wisconsin GOP Rep. Paul Ryan on their failed White House bid.\n\nSources in Rubio's office declined to comment.",

        "text": "El Salvador\u2019s president pledges continued fight against gang violence\nThe smallest country in Central America, El Salvador has been defined by its poverty, corruption, and gang-led violence. This has led millions of its residents to leave for safer countries, including the United States.\n\nIn 2019, Nayib Bukele, a businessman and former mayor of the country\u2019s capital San Salvador, was elected president with the promise of transforming the country and invigorating the stagnant economy.\n\nHis tactics for eradicating the gang violence included establishing a continued state of emergency that has led to the incarceration of tens of thousands of suspected gang members, news reports said.\n\nHuman rights organizations claim that this continued state of emergency has allowed for thousands of innocent victims to be jailed without any legal recourse. On Feb. 4, Bukele was reelected with 83 percent of the vote. Some call him a \u201cpopular dictator.\u201d\n\nJohn Twichell, a lecturer and director of Latin American Studies at the University of Miami College of Arts and Sciences, sheds light on what lies ahead for El Salvador.\n\nWhat is the political situation in El Salvador right now?\n\nPolitics in El Salvador hinges on national and citizen security, partly because of decades of gang violence and organized crime, and partly because Nayib Bukele has skillfully securitized Salvadoran politics to further his own authority and incumbency.\n\nUnder Bukele\u2019s leadership since 2019, El Salvador\u2019s number of incarcerated has dramatically risen to an estimated 105,000, or 1.7 percent of the 6.3 million population.\n\nIn parallel, under its leadership, the Bukele government has reduced the national homicide rate from the alarming 105 per 100,000 residents (in 2015) down to the current 8 murders per 100,000 residents, which is equal to that of the U.S.\n\nAs indicated by the presidential election outcome, the electorate approves of the results brought by Bukele\u2019s \u201claw and order\u201d or \u201cmano dura\u201d policies on crime and violence while they have up to now apparently been willing to overlook the associated broad curbing of\u2014and many particular cases of violations of\u2014human rights.\n\nYet, beyond a divided political opposition, there is noticeable resistance to Bukele\u2019s securitization of crime and gangs, and his ostensible rule by decree since 2022.\n\nInternational nongovernmental organizations, or NGOs, are at the forefront of civil society actors challenging Bukele\u2019s methods in restoring security in El Salvador. The number of academics and family members of those imprisoned merely on suspicion of crimes is also growing, accompanied by mounting domestic and international criticism of the harsh strategies and tactics tied to Bukele\u2019s ongoing rule by decree.\n\nThe question is how long the vast majority of Salvadorans will continue to back Bukele\u2019s strongman approach to governing. In the short-term, it appears the majority of the electorate dismisses such criticisms and outcries, apparently more satisfied by increased safety, economic prosperity, and a greater sense of a return to normalcy on the streets of their neighborhoods.\n\nPresident Nayib Bukele is seen by many as an authoritarian dictator. How did he get this reputation?\n\nBukele is a millennial whose previous career was as a publicist and media expert; this is someone who knows the ropes of both politics and social media and what it takes to master digital platforms to promote narratives that serve Bukele\u2019s own interests and those of his New Ideas party. He unabashedly dares others to provoke him on Twitter (X), with his previous profile header proclaiming himself to be \u201cel dictador m\u00e1s cool del mundo mundial\u201d which translates to \u201cthe world\u2019s coolest dictator,\u201d recently updated to \"Philosopher King.\"\n\nIn 2022, Bukele declared a state of emergency to address issues of crime and violence, and as noted above, that decree remains in place today. The decree suspended such civil rights as due process and public assembly, while granting the government extraordinary powers to surveil, arrest, and imprison suspected criminals.\n\nThe legislative assembly, currently controlled by Bukele\u2019s New Ideas party, in 2023 passed judicial reforms granting prosecutors the ability to conduct mass trials\u2014of as many as 900 persons\u2014among those imprisoned as \u201cterrorists\u201d on suspicion of crimes. The mass trials have provoked outrage among those near and far, resistant to Bukele\u2019s manipulation of democratic institutions previously set up to regulate the exercise of power.\n\nThis, plus the perceived unconstitutionality of his reelection bid\u2014in 2021, the Supreme Court overturned a 2014 reaffirming vote of El Salvador\u2019s constitution which prohibits immediate presidential reelection\u2014have earned Bukele a reputation he is outwardly proud of; that of an authoritarian dictator.\n\nHe has won the presidential election, and his party rules the Congress. What makes him so popular?\n\nBukele and his New Ideas party went into last month\u2019s election with the decreased crime and citizen security data, to point to and take credit for, along with other policies and programs such as the Centers for Urban Wellbeing and Opportunities (CUBOs) aimed at local community socioeconomic development, empowerment, and inclusion, 12 of which are now up and running, nearly halfway to achieving the goal of building 30.\n\nSuch data and initiatives aimed at delivering the goods have definitely contributed to New Ideas\u2019 consolidation of single party rule in El Salvador. Equally significant in this case is the broader anti-establishment trend in politics throughout the Caribbean and Latin America, upheld going into last month\u2019s election. While Bukele and New Ideas were the incumbent in that race, they are still considered anti-establishment in contrast to the center-right ARENA and left-wing FMLN, both of which presented candidates, but neither of which were competitive, due in part to voter perceptions of ARENA and FMLN as being historically corrupt and inept.\n\nAs for its popularity, leading up to last month\u2019s election, New Ideas cleverly harnessed state-run media and social media platforms to promote false choice narratives between its own policies and those of the opposition. For example, New Ideas claimed that if the opposition were to win the presidency, they would set free all imprisoned suspected criminals, thus returning El Salvador to its crime-ridden and violent times of a decade ago that most voters still vividly recall. In the eyes of a steadfastly loyal base, Bukele and New Ideas have delivered results in fighting crime and insecurity on the streets of El Salvador, restoring a sense of normalcy to the lives of everyday Salvadorans.\n\nCould Bukele\u2019s strong hand toward crime be exported to other countries in the region?\n\nAs the nature of transnationally-linked organized crime and the violence tied to it continues to threaten the security of Caribbean and Latin American countries, there does appear to be a growing regional diffusion effect brought about by an envy of sorts of the beneficial short-term results of Bukele\u2019s strongman approach to insecurity, whereby confounded political leaders and candidates running in elections to replace them are, at least in rhetorical terms, promising to go the way of Bukele in their own efforts to address spreading problems of drug and human trafficking combined with gang violence.\n\nYet, as the outcome of Guatemala\u2019s 2023 presidential election in which even the left-leaning candidate Sandra Torres vowed to adopt Bukele\u2019s approach to crime prevention illustrates, each country\u2019s politics is unique, with the majority of Guatemalans ultimately favoring Torres\u2019 runoff opponent Bernardo Arevalo in a race determined more by Arevalo\u2019s promise to end corruption, with Torres having been perceived as an archetype of that corruption.\n\nMoreover, as we see in the case of state failure in Haiti, a distinction must be made by political leaders and the international community between situations of organized violence that call for exercise of the rule of law and justice as opposed to military responses\u2014with the case in Haiti now tending toward the latter even though gangs are still Haiti\u2019s greatest threat.\n\nSo, all of this is to say that while the case of El Salvador and Bukele\u2019s handling of the security situation there may be an attractive example for politicians elsewhere in the region to aspire to, the likelihood that any rhetoric they deploy being converted into actionable policy would face countless contextual challenges.\n\nHave government policies helped the economy of the country?\n\nYes, Bukele\u2019s draconian law and order security policies and the targeting of gangs have yielded some positive economic results for El Salvador over the past three years.\n\nOne of the most immediate economic results of the eradication of gang activity has been the elimination of rampant extortion\u2014whereby gang members would, on a daily basis, collect tolls from and force other forms of \u201cprotection\u201d upon nearly all everyday Salvadorans in exchange for payments\u2014which posed a huge drag on the economy.\n\nFree of extortion threats in an environment of restored and relative public safety, there are renewed signs of local businesses opening. That, combined with El Salvador\u2019s rebound as a destination of international tourism, has generated a favorable influx of foreign currency to the benefit of the government and broader economy. Still, the apparent tradeoffs are stark if one considers the limits to civil liberties and human rights being imposed to breathe new life into El Salvador\u2019s economy.",

        "text": "Mug shot of Donald Trump\nBooking photograph of the 45th U.S. president\n\nMug shot of Donald Trump Trump's booking photograph released by the Fulton County, Georgia sheriff's office Completion date August 24, 2023 ( ) Medium Photograph Subject Donald Trump Location Atlanta, Georgia, U.S.\n\nOn August 24, 2023, after being indicted on racketeering and related charges, Donald Trump, former president of the United States and current president-elect of the United States, voluntarily surrendered himself to authorities at the Fulton County Jail in Atlanta, Georgia, where a mug shot of him was taken. In the photograph, Trump, wearing a blue suit with a white shirt and a red tie, glowers at the camera in front of a gray backdrop. His face is lit from the side and from above.[1] It is the first and thus far only police booking photograph of a U.S. president.[1][2][3] After its publishing, the mug shot was used on merchandise by Trump's 2024 presidential campaign, in Internet memes, and featured on various media reports worldwide.[4][5][6]\n\nBackground [ edit ]\n\nOn August 14, 2023, a grand jury in Fulton County, Georgia, indicted Trump on charges of election racketeering and related offenses, and issued an arrest warrant. The county's district attorney Fani Willis offered him the option to surrender voluntarily.[7] Shortly after 19:30 Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), August 24, Trump turned himself in at the Fulton County Jail in Atlanta, Georgia and was booked, given inmate number P01135809, processed and released on bond.[8] At 20:05 EDT, a copy of the booking photograph without the Fulton County Jail watermark was posted on Twitter.[9] CNN released the official image at 21:27.[10]\n\nAt 21:38, Trump posted the photograph to X with the text \"MUG SHOT - AUGUST 24, 2023, ELECTION INTERFERENCE, NEVER SURRENDER!\" The post contained a link to a WinRed page soliciting contributions for his 2024 presidential campaign.[11][12] The post was the first instance of Trump's activity on Twitter since his account was reinstated in November 2022 by Elon Musk following his acquisition of the platform.[13]\n\nUsage [ edit ]\n\nFundraising [ edit ]\n\nBefore Trump's arraignment in April 2023 in New York City, his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, said that any mug shot of Trump would \"go down in history as the most famous mug shot ever to exist in America\".[3] Ex-Trump spokesman Hogan Gidley joked that such a photograph would be the \"most manly, most masculine, most handsome mug shot of all time\".[14] No booking photograph was taken during the arraignment, and Trump's campaign website began selling T-shirts featuring a pretend mug shot.[15]\n\nNinety minutes after Trump's release from the Fulton County Jail on August 24, the Trump campaign began selling T-shirts, mugs, and other merchandise with his booking photograph.[16] On August 26, the campaign said it had raised $7.1 million since the release of the photo.[17] The Lincoln Project, sellers on Etsy, and others also began selling merchandise with the booking photo; the Trump campaign, which did not hold the copyright, threatened to sue any user who did not obtain their prior authorization.[18][19]\n\nIn December 2023, Trump launched a set of digital trading cards as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which he labeled the \"Mugshot Edition\". 100,000 digital cards were released at a price of $99 each. Customers who purchased 47 or more digital trading cards would receive one of 2,042 limited edition physical trading cards, 25 of which are hand-signed by Trump, along with a piece of the suit that he wore in the Fulton County Jail for the mugshot, and an invitation to dine with Trump at Mar-a-Lago. The first 200 customers who purchased at least 100 cards would receive a unique NFT, two tickets to a cocktail reception with Trump, a second physical card with pieces of Trump's suit and tie, and two additional commemorative cards.[20]\n\nNews coverage [ edit ]\n\nMany newspapers in the United States and other countries featured the mug shot \"splashed across\" or in articles on the front page of their print issues while others printed teasers with thumbnails of the booking photograph on the front page.[21][22] Other news outlets reported on the reporting.[23][24][25]\n\nFox News featured the mug shot in an article on an exclusive interview Trump gave them soon after his release from jail. They cited him as saying that \"officials in Georgia 'insisted' on a mugshot\" and that he \"agreed to do that\".[26]\n\nReactions [ edit ]\n\nThe Associated Press called it \"an American moment\" and an \"enduring image that will appear in history books long after Donald Trump is gone.\" They described the image as Trump glaring at the camera defiantly, as if he was \"staring down a nemesis through the lens.\"[27] The Guardian's Chris McGreal referred to it as the defining mug shot of the decade, and one that defines modern U.S. politics. He noted, \"Trump's hostility shines through as he turns his eyes up toward the camera above him and in his taut, downturned mouth [...] Dressed in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie, he makes no attempt to put on a smile like some of his co-defendants in their mugshots. The picture does not flatter but it does convey the message many of Trump's supporters want to hear\u2014belligerence.\"[28]\n\nThe New York Times fashion critic Vanessa Friedman called the image \"a mug shot for history that is unprecedented\" and noted that \"his face is lit from above by a blinding white flash that hits his ash blond hair like a spotlight. [...] He glowers out from beneath his brows, unsmiling, eyes rendered oddly bloodshot, brow furrowed, chin tucked in, as if he is about to head-butt the camera. The image is stark, shorn of the flags and fancy that have been Mr. Trump's preferred framings for photo ops at Mar-a-Lago or Trump Tower, or during his term in office, and that communicate power and the gilded glow of success.\" Friedman quoted historian Sean Wilentz as saying that, of the myriad of photos of Trump, it could be the most famous or notorious and serve as \"the ultimate bookend to a political arc in the United States that began decades ago, with Richard Nixon's 'I am not a crook.'\"[1]\n\nCNN called the image \"one of the most iconic images of anyone who served as commander in chief\" and \"stark in its simplicity in a way that must surely grate for an ex-reality star for whom image is everything\".[2] The Independent observed that \"the 45th president glowers straight into the camera, brow furrowed and sizable bushy eyebrows lowered as he faces his fate\", adding \"it is an undeniable fact that Trump's mug shot is both historically and culturally significant\u2014and soon to be seen everywhere, forever.\"[29]\n\nThe Telegraph stated, \"The 45th president is pictured striking a hostile pose, with his eyebrows contracted, lips pursed and a menacing scowl on his face. His head and the top of his shoulders are visible in what is likely to become a world-famous image.\"[30] Time commented, \"His platinum blonde [sic] cotton candy wisp of hair shimmering in the harsh jailhouse lighting. His eyes locked in a hard stare. His mouth flattened in a grimace. Instead of smiling like some of his co-defendants, he appears to be scowling.\"[31] BBC News referred to the composition of the picture as a \"photographer's nightmare.\"[32]\n\nBritish film critic Robbie Collin likened Trump's expression to the \"Kubrick stare\", emblematic of several memorable characters of American filmmaker Stanley Kubrick's films.[33] In Internet memes and commentary, the booking photograph was also said to imitate character Vigo the Cruel's \"menacing stare featured prominently in Ghostbusters II\",[34] as well as the eponymous character's \"blue steel\" pose in the movie Zoolander (Trump himself made a cameo appearance in the latter).[34][35]\n\nColumnist Maureen Dowd of The New York Times observed that \"the Picture of Donald Trump should have been a 'foul parody,' a reflection of what the chancer has done with his life. It should have shown Trump's corroding soul rather than his truculent face. It should have revealed a man so cynical and depraved that he is willing to smash our nation\u2019s soul\u2014our democracy\u2014and destroy faith in our institutions. All this simply to avoid being called a loser.\"[36] On August 27, art critic Jerry Saltz called the mug shot \"the most famous photograph in the world\" and that \"[a]lready the man with the scowl is using his portrait as both a statement of defiance and a claim of persecution\u2014a symbol as diabolically ingenious as the red MAGA hat.\"[37]\n\nWhen asked by a journalist for his opinion of the photograph, President Joe Biden, Trump's successor and predecessor, quipped \"handsome guy, wonderful guy\".[38]\n\nOn February 23, 2024, Trump was criticized for comments during a campaign speech for saying his four criminal indictments and mug shot boosted his appeal among black voters and for comparing his legal jeopardy to historical anti-black discrimination,[39][40] stating that \"when I did the mug shot in Atlanta, that mug shot is No. 1. You know who embraced it more than anyone else? The Black population.\"[41]\n\nSee also [ edit ]",
