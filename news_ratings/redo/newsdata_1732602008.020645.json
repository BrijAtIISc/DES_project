        "text": "Iran election: Hardliners dominate presidential candidates\nHardliners dominate Iran presidential candidates\n\nEPA (Clockwise from top left) Saeed Jalili, Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, Masoud Pezeshkian, Mostafa Pourmohammadi, Amirhossein Qazizadeh Hashemi, and Alireza Zakani\n\nIran\u2019s Guardian Council has approved six candidates to run in this month's presidential election. Almost all of them are Islamic hardliners close to the thinking of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The constitutional body vetted the 80 people who registered to stand on 28 June according to their religious and revolutionary credentials. It appears to have approved candidates with a view to setting up hardliners to hold on to the presidency following the death of President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash last month.\n\nEPA Saeed Jalili was Iran's chief nuclear negotiator and ran the supreme leader's office\n\nOne front-runner is Saeed Jalili, a former secretary of the Supreme National Security Council and nuclear negotiator who is thought to be the favourite of Ayatollah Khamenei. In his time as head of Iran\u2019s nuclear negotiating team, Mr Jalili repeatedly stonewalled the talks with five world powers while Iran advanced its nuclear programme. He is seen by many as a largely tedious, hard-line Islamist ideologue with no executive experience.\n\nEPA Mohamad Baqer Qalibaf unsuccessfully ran for the presidency in 2005, 2013 and 2017\n\nThe present Speaker of Parliament, Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, is another candidate with a good chance. He is a regime insider and former general of the Revolutionary Guards who has also served as the country\u2019s police chief and mayor of Tehran. One of that pair might decide to leave the race at the last minute in order not to divide the votes. Three other candidates - Tehran Mayor Alireza Zakani, Vice-President Amirhossein Qazizadeh Hashemi and Mostafa Pourmohammadi - are also hardliners of various shades. Mr Pourmohammadi is a former justice and interior minister who, along with Ebrahim Raisi, was a member of the so-called \u201cDeath Committee\u201d that approved the execution of thousands of political prisoners in the late 1980s. An exception to the hardliners is Massoud Pezeshkian, the member of parliament for Tabriz. A relative moderate, he has an outside chance of winning if turnout is very low. Mr Pezeshkian could win the votes of many otherwise reluctant voters who may see a vote of him is a vote against the hardliners. He is also ethnically Azeri, and is thought to have the votes of the some in the north-east of Iran, where the bulk of the population are Turkish-speaking Azeris. Leaving him in the mix might be a ploy to push up a turnout that otherwise could be historically low.\n\nGetty Ex-president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has not been allowed to run",

        "text": "Trump and Biden neck and neck nationally and in battlegrounds \u2014 CBS News poll\nAmong all the factors on voters' minds this election, former President Donald Trump's guilty verdict pales in comparison to issues like the economy, inflation, and the border \u2014 all items on which Trump maintains advantages. As such, the verdict has not dramatically reshaped the race.\n\nBut what we do see is a few more Joe Biden voters activated out of opposition to Trump. His vote has become increasingly centered around anti-Trump sentiment, more so than affinity for Mr. Biden himself. Today, most of Mr. Biden's voters say their main rationale is opposing Trump, and that's up from March.\n\nWhether that dynamic is enough to sustain Mr. Biden looms as one of the central questions of this campaign \u2014 a contest that today is essentially tied in likely voter preference, both nationally and across the collective battleground states.\n\nAmong Trump's voters, the verdict is a wash. A few say it's a reason to show him support, a few say they're backing him despite it, and the great bulk of them say it doesn't matter either way.\n\nA majority say Trump's conviction is not a factor in their vote decision. In fact, the trial ranks much lower as a factor when considered on its own than every other issue tested.\n\nMost of Mr. Biden's voters now say their main rationale is to oppose Trump, not because they like Mr. Biden \u2014 an increase in this rationale since March.\n\n(Mr. Biden capitalized on this kind of sentiment in 2020 too, as substantial numbers expressed it in many battleground states that year.)\n\nMoreover, we see this dynamic again in how people frame their vote decision, along the lines of whether this election is a referendum or a choice.\n\nWhen people say this election is just about their view on Trump, most vote for Mr. Biden.\n\nHowever, when people instead see this race as a judgment just on Mr. Biden, they vote for Trump.\n\nAnd when they're framing it as a comparison between the two, slightly more are voting for Trump than Mr. Biden.\n\nHere's why that direct comparison right now favors Trump:\n\nTrump outpaces Mr. Biden on a range of qualities like being seen as effective, tough, energetic and \u2014 more narrowly \u2014 competent. Also, more think Trump has a vision of where he wants to lead the country.\n\nMr. Biden does better on personal likability and being viewed as compassionate. But that likability gap does not match vote preferences, because a lot of people who dislike Trump personally are voting for Trump anyway.\n\nAnd here's what partially insulates Trump after the trial verdict: so many of his backers, and Republican base, have seen the charges as not serious and the trial as politically motivated.\n\nIn fact, most Republicans believe that the prosecution in New York was brought on not by decisions by New York prosecutors, but at the direction of the Biden administration. Looking forward, if he's elected, that view may have implications for what they'd want Trump to do in turn. Half of Republicans want Trump to get revenge against his political opponents by investigating and bringing criminal charges against them \u2014 a number that rises among MAGA Republicans.\n\nThe border and immigration\n\nThere's broad support for Mr. Biden's recent executive order dealing with the border, including from most Republicans, but despite that, voters who place a high priority on the border are backing Trump by a large margin.\n\nVoters still tend to think migrant crossings will go down more under Trump.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has talked about the actions he would take toward immigration if elected to a second term, including deportation efforts.\n\nA nearly six in 10 majority of voters say they would favor, in principle, a new government program to deport all undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.\n\n(That isn't purely partisan, it includes a third of Democrats. It rises to nine in 10 Republicans.)\n\nA similarly sized majority would have local law enforcement try to identify those living in the U.S. illegally, and just under half support the idea of setting up large government detention centers to sort out which people ought to be deported.\n\nKey voting groups and rationales: Who is backing who?\n\nViews of the national economy are more negative today than they were in March, and voters' financial concerns continue to lead to more Trump support. This, despite positive macro numbers in the jobs report and stock market.\n\nBut inflation \u2014 likely a proxy term for still-high prices \u2014 continues to affect voters.\n\nTrump is up more than 2 to 1 among those who say higher prices have been a hardship. And Trump leads Mr. Biden big among those who say the economy is a major factor in their vote.\n\nMore continue to think they will be financially better off with Trump in office than with Mr. Biden.\n\nNationally, Mr. Biden's support from some key parts of his base have inched up a bit from March, including women. More women now call abortion a major factor in their vote than they did in March and those that do go big for Mr. Biden.\n\nThe president's support among Black voters continues to lag behind his 2020 performance, but it has improved since the spring. More Black voters now say he fights for people like them than said so in March.\n\nMr. Biden has improved a bit with independents compared to our last national poll in early March. (Given that time frame, it's not precisely clear when that shift may have occurred.) That said, there is some anti-Trump sentiment among the independents now backing Mr. Biden. A larger majority of them are doing so now to oppose Trump.\n\nBut Mr. Biden does not have a meaningful advantage among Hispanics, a group he won handily in 2020. More Hispanic voters think they will be financially better off if Trump wins than if Mr. Biden does.\n\nTrump continues to do well with White voters without a college degree and with older voters, groups that backed him in 2016 and 2020. And despite speculation about the \"anti-Trump\" vote in the GOP primaries, more than nine in 10 Republicans are backing Trump, similar to the number of Democrats who are backing Mr. Biden.\n\nMuch of these same patterns play out across the battleground states.\n\nNationally, Republicans have a turnout advantage helping lift Trump, but in the battleground states, Democrats and Republicans are about equally likely to say they'll definitely vote, perhaps due to campaigns trying to activate their voters there.\n\nThis CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,063 U.S. adult residents interviewed between June 5-7, 2024. The data includes an oversample in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. The sample was weighted by gender, age, race, and education, based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as past vote. The margin of error is \u00b13.2 points among all adults and \u00b13.8 points among registered voters.\n\nToplines",

Although probably not in the way he\u2019d have liked.\n\nAs votes for the European Parliament were still being counted, Mr Macron dominated the headlines.\n\nHis drubbing in the poll by French hard-right nationalists had been expected. His decision to dissolve France\u2019s national parliament as a result, came as a shock.\n\nHe had played with the idea last year, after getting trounced in France\u2019s last general election but few expected this move now.\n\nIt\u2019s a huge gamble. From a position of weakness.\n\nEmmanuel Macron describes himself as a centrist and a passionate European.\n\nThis snap general election, taking place in two rounds on 30 June and 7 July, could result in him having to work alongside a French prime minister from the Eurosceptic far right.\n\nMarine Le Pen, regularly portrayed as his political nemesis, declared on Sunday that her party was ready to govern.\n\nIt\u2019s happened before in France that the president, who is the country\u2019s most powerful politician, and the prime minister, hail from different political parties.\n\nBut if the new prime minister were to come from the far right, that would be a first for France.\n\nMarine Le Pen has worked hard in recent years to try to broaden the appeal of her political movement and to soften its extremist image.\n\nShe and her supporters hope this significant victory at EU level (her National Rally party garnered more than double the number of votes of President Macron\u2019s Renaissance party) will translate into huge wins in the snap election back home.\n\nHer dream would be that those successes would then bring her, or her hugely popular prodigee, the 28-year-old Jordan Bardella, a big stride closer to eventually becoming French president - something she\u2019s attempted and failed to achieve a number of times before. The next presidential vote in France is scheduled for 2027.",

        "text": "The Least Important Election of a Lifetime\nSign up for The Media Today, CJR\u2019s daily newsletter.\n\nEarly in the morning at the Trial of the Century\u2122, I was standing in line with a few dozen members of the general public, hoping to snag a seat inside the New York City courtroom where Donald Trump faced the first of his many criminal charges. The line was quiet and orderly. A woman close to the front\u2014she\u2019d been here before, she wanted us to know\u2014walked up and down, counting. We heard there was room for around thirty-five people to get in; she tallied forty-eight. There were two young children, an elderly person with a walker. A man in a cowboy hat and fringed leather jacket was holding a yellow legal pad filled with notes. Beside me, a father and son\u2014a sophomore at Stuyvesant High\u2014took some time off from spring break to witness a former president being tried for a crime. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those once-in-a-lifetime things,\u201d the son said. Besides, he added, \u201cwe already live near here.\u201d Farther back was a man who had come to town to see Billy Joel in concert the night before. \u201cI\u2019m a little hungover,\u201d he confided. \u201cHonestly, I thought there\u2019d be more people here.\u201d\n\nIt was strangely quiet. The park next to us, where the week prior a man lit himself on fire in front of dozens of onlookers\u2014he was protesting something completely unrelated to the trial\u2014was virtually empty. Half an hour earlier, I\u2019d watched as three Secret Service agents roused a man who was sleeping on the ground\u2014checking, I suppose, to make sure he wasn\u2019t hiding weapons or explosives under his blanket. He was now slumped on a nearby bench, looking irritated for having been woken up.\n\nWhere the heck was everyone? Six months into 2024, it\u2019s become clear that this will not be an enthusiastic political season\u2014for voters or for the media. Television audiences were steeply down for the primaries, part of what Semafor has called the \u201ccollapsing US political-media-industrial complex.\u201d President Joe Biden faced no meaningful party opposition; so far this year, he has barely campaigned. Trump has made more of a showing but never bothered to participate in a debate with his Republican challengers. Many voters, sensing an inevitable repeat of the cast, themes, and arguments of 2020, have bailed. In April, NBC reported that just 64 percent of registered voters polled said they had a high level of interest in the race, down from 77 percent in 2020. General engagement in the election has hit its lowest point in nearly two decades.\n\nTrump\u2019s first criminal trial\u2014and his eventual conviction on all thirty-four counts\u2014had its moments, including on the day Stormy Daniels, the former porn star, took the stand. But overall, ratings this year have underperformed what news executives are accustomed to in the lead-up to an election. \u201cThe overarching emotion among voters is apathy and even burnout,\u201d said Brian Stelter, the journalist and close observer of the American political and media landscape, who occasionally reported for CNN from outside the courthouse. \u201cWe can see and measure that sense of exhaustion indirectly through all sorts of yardsticks: traffic to news sites, TV ratings, all these data points that suggest the American electorate is fed up and mostly tuned out.\u201d\n\nSix in ten American adults say they are worn out by coverage of the campaign and candidates.\n\nAs time goes on, voters don\u2019t just pay less attention, they see less meaning in major political events. A poll in April found that only 5 percent of Americans consider the siege of the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, to be the most memorable part of Trump\u2019s presidency. (Four percent said it was the pandemic; nearly a quarter of hands raised for the \u201ceconomy,\u201d whatever that means.) When it comes to the cases against Trump\u2014beyond New York, he faces criminal charges in Georgia state court and in US District Court in DC and Florida\u2014polling by the New York Times shows that as the proceedings drag on, voters become less likely to think that Trump did anything so wrong in the first place. \u201cPeople are\u2014forget fatigued, they\u2019ve got their own opinions about it all already,\u201d Steve Krakauer, a longtime TV producer and journalist who now runs Megyn Kelly\u2019s digital show, told me. \u201cThis is a rerun of 2020, so even if you had enormously popular candidates that happened to be running against each other again,\u201d he added, \u201cit\u2019s never as fun as the first time.\u201d\n\nAcross the spectrum, news outlets are feeling the pain, even on specialized shows such as Krakauer\u2019s, with built-in audiences of partisan political junkies. Conservative news websites have seen their audiences plummet; political fractures and dimming philanthropic enthusiasm have challenged sites on the left. \u201cDonald Trump, the Republican nominee for president, is sitting in a courtroom facing felony charges, every day, and everyone\u2019s like\u2026\u2018Eh,\u2019\u201d Jon Favreau, the former speechwriter for Barack Obama, remarked on his podcast, Pod Save America. \u201cThere is something weird going on,\u201d his cohost Dan Pfeiffer replied.\n\nSign up for CJR\u2019s daily email\n\n\u201cThe segments we do on Trump or the election tend to underperform the average segment,\u201d Ryan Grim, The Intercept\u2019s DC bureau chief and cohost of Counter Points, a digital news show, told me. \u201cI think there\u2019s a collective kind of denial going on, like, There\u2019s no way that we have to confront this election again. You can\u2019t possibly be serious.\u201d Grim compared the attitude of his audience to the 2022 Bo Burnham song \u201cJoe Biden,\u201d which includes the incredulous lyric \u201cThey\u2019re really gonna make me vote for Joe Biden?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s perfect,\u201d Grim said. \u201cThere\u2019s zero enthusiasm.\u201d\n\nBack at the line to get into the Trump trial, a court officer arrived, holding small green slips of paper. He handed them to everyone who made the cut, and stopped about a dozen people short of us at the end. \u201cThat\u2019s it for now,\u201d he said, and offered an apologetic smile. From behind, I heard the man from out of town sigh, accepting his fate. \u201cHonestly,\u201d he said, \u201cI really just came to see Billy Joel.\u201d\n\nThe question facing the political press today is whether the public\u2019s apathy is a problem of circumstance\u2014a uniquely disliked set of candidates, a rare presidential rerun\u2014or if something more fundamental, and therefore worrisome, is going on. Surveys show that Americans aren\u2019t just checking out from the election\u2014they\u2019re tuning out all news. In 2016, Pew found that 51 percent of American adults followed the news all or most of the time. By 2022, that was down to 38 percent. The same year, the Knight Foundation reported that Americans\u2019 attention to national news was the lowest it had been since 2018.\n\nThe term for people who shun current events is \u201cnews avoiders,\u201d and their ranks are swelling. The Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, which has tracked people who say they avoid the news, puts the turning point at the arrival of COVID. In 2017, 29 percent of respondents told Reuters that they often or sometimes avoided the news; by last year, it was up to 36 percent. A new Pew report found that about six in ten American adults say they are worn out by coverage of the campaign and candidates. Another Pew study found that some 70 percent of people who avoid the news say that the news just generally wears them down.\n\nBenjamin Toff\u2014a former journalist, now a professor of journalism at the University of Minnesota\u2014has been talking to the news-fatigued for years. In December, he published Avoiding the News with Ruth Palmer and Rasmus Kleis Nielsen, which looks closely at people who avoid the news entirely\u2014as much as 10 percent of the public, by one estimate. If that seems a small segment of society, it\u2019s about the same as the portion of people who say they follow the news avidly\u2014perhaps even more. \u201cThe percentage of people who pay for a digital subscription to The Atlantic or The New Yorker or the New York Times is smaller than the percentage of consistent news avoiders,\u201d Toff told me. \u201cIf the belief is that news is being made for everyone, that\u2019s a distorted notion, because it\u2019s really largely being consumed by a small segment\u2014and a smaller and smaller segment, as we\u2019ve seen\u2014of the public.\u201d The book examines some of the reasons why people avoid the news\u2014they struggle to determine which sources to trust, the information they find doesn\u2019t provide direct answers to their questions, they have trouble evaluating coverage. \u201cThey see it as a source of conflict and tension,\u201d Toff told me. \u201cAnd they see it as irrelevant\u2014a distraction from the things they really care about.\u201d At some point, they check out.\n\n\u201cThe Hidden Tribes of America,\u201d a yearlong study by More in Common, a public interest group focused on uniting the country, calls these people \u201cthe exhausted majority.\u201d Those in the exhausted majority hold political views and economic identities that cut across the spectrum\u2014but all are turned off by the daily drumbeat of political affairs. According to the research, this cohort accounts for roughly two-thirds of the American population. \u201cThe exhausted majority is flexible, forgotten, and frustrated,\u201d Daniel Yudkin, a social psychologist who helps lead research at More in Common, told me. \u201cThey are more likely to want to find common ground, more likely to want to move past divisions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an encroaching edge of exhaustion that\u2019s creeping outward and pulling more and more people into this center group of the jaded.\u201d\n\nYudkin\u2019s research focuses on moral philosophy\u2014how people navigate thorny questions of right and wrong in their everyday lives. (One of his ongoing projects is a four-year study of Reddit\u2019s \u201cAm I the Asshole?\u201d board.) He doesn\u2019t see the exhausted majority as people who don\u2019t care\u2014quite the opposite. They often care a lot about the things that speak to them directly, it\u2019s just that news coverage and political discourse don\u2019t reliably do so. \u201cThings seem to be moving so fast in the political sphere, but for the exhausted majority, it all just feels like people fighting each other\u2014we\u2019re still not making progress on the issues we care about, we still don\u2019t have a politician who is speaking to what we think is important,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re necessarily tuned out. There\u2019s just other issues and topics and questions that people are dealing with.\u201d\n\nToff notes that many people who say they avoid the news actually interact with a lot of it indirectly, through Instagram influencers or family members. On social media, however, algorithms pull you sharply in one direction or another\u2014the filter bubble effect\u2014and deliver you to intense, sometimes horrifying extremes. What you experience online inevitably bleeds into how you perceive mainstream coverage\u2014and other people. A study out of Northwestern University showed that most Americans see themselves as fairly moderate but imagine those on the \u201cother side\u201d to be significantly more extreme and fervent\u2014one of the many things that turns them off following the news. \u201cSurely one might (understandably) think that the main reason people avoid the news must be the news itself, so the solution must be to fix the news,\u201d Toff and his coathors write in Avoiding the News. \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nYudkin and More in Common haven\u2019t done a \u201cHidden Tribes\u201d survey of American political engagement in several years, but they hope to give the subject another look in 2025. By then, he expects the ranks of the weary to have grown. \u201cIn my head I\u2019m sort of imagining a creeping border of the exhausted majority,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s an encroaching edge of exhaustion that\u2019s creeping outward and pulling more and more people into this center group of the jaded.\u201d\n\nYudkin recently moved from Brooklyn to New Orleans, where his new neighbors include many of the same people he\u2019s been researching. He doesn\u2019t see them surging back to political news anytime soon. \u201cSome of the things that get people to pay attention to the media are the apocalyptic proclamations about the end of democracy,\u201d Yudkin said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s possible the exhausted majority is becoming less susceptible to these kinds of inflammatory headlines. Like, Eh, this is the tenth time I\u2019ve been told this is unprecedented. This idea of something being unprecedented, especially for the exhausted majority, is falling on deaf ears. They\u2019re over it.\u201d\n\nThe notion that national politics, and the news around it, are disconnected from the needs and experiences of Americans is not so novel. In 1988, when Joan Didion surveyed the landscape of a particularly tedious presidential election season, she pronounced that politics had lost its way in minutiae and closely held plotlines that only the most avid disciple could follow. \u201cWhat strikes one most vividly about such a campaign is precisely its remoteness from the actual life of the country,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe figures are well known, and suggest a national indifference usually construed, by those inside the process, as ignorance, or \u2018apathy,\u2019 in any case a defect not in themselves but in the clay they have been given to mold.\u201d Today, amid a perilous decline in subscribers and patrons, that apathy is, if not harder to disdain, at least more difficult to ignore.\n\nSamantha Ragland, the vice president of journalism programs at the American Press Institute, has devoted her professional life to addressing the problem. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to be hopeless, they don\u2019t want to be anxiety-ridden,\u201d told me. She\u2019s now at work developing strategies to help outlets reach news avoiders. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things happening in life, and we are very much still in a post-pandemic mindset,\u201d she said. \u201cSo horse race coverage, just tracking drama in headlines, all that is really going to support people steering away from news.\u201d Lately, she\u2019s turned her attention away somewhat from social media, and focused more on building personal connections. \u201cWe used to talk about audience engagement, and now we talk about community engagement,\u201d she said. \u201cAudience engagement is about the distribution of resources and assets and reporting you have so that as many people as possible can consume your content. Community engagement is about participating in your community as a member of the community. It\u2019s about looking beyond the numbers to see the faces of your readers.\u201d She talks about reporters getting out \u201cin front of their byline\u201d and making themselves known to readers directly. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how to fill someone\u2019s needs until you know the someone.\u201d\n\nAmy O\u2019Leary has spent much of the past decade thinking about these ideas, too. In a past life, she was an editor at the Times; today, she\u2019s a media consultant living in New Hampshire, where her neighbors and friends in town include people who think the moon landing was faked and hoist upside-down American flags over their woodsheds. (\u201cThe conversations we have are very different than the ones I had in Brooklyn,\u201d she said.) O\u2019Leary spends a lot of time wrestling with the question of what journalism is, or should be. \u201cHow do I want to have impact in the world? Because I really don\u2019t think most of the tools I have are doing it.\u201d She\u2019s drawn to the Brave Little State podcast, from Vermont\u2019s public radio station, which solicits story ideas from members of the community and invites listeners to join in the reporting process. She also admires an Internews project called El Migrante, which interviewed migrants at the southern border and asked them what they wanted to read or hear about their own experiences. \u201cWhen you think about journalism as a service,\u201d she said, \u201cwhat you\u2019re really asking is \u2018What is the point of the news? What is its purpose in society?\u2019 And we have to ask that question in a way that\u2019s a little deeper than previous generations have had to ask it. The increasing distrust of news, the emotional experience of the news, the profound feeling of disempowerment that people have\u2014when you look at all those things, the way we\u2019ve been traditionally delivering the news is not meeting those needs.\u201d\n\nTo that end, last year, the Times updated bylines to provide more detail, including biographical information about reporters. \u201cThe new form allows us to more fully describe the scope of our news gathering,\u201d an announcement read, \u201cemphasizing our role as expert eyewitnesses and thus boosting our credibility.\u201d Some publications have experimented creatively with presentation, translating stories into guides and physical pamphlets that boil down reporting to its most user-friendly essence. Toff and his coauthors provide more suggestions in their book, all aimed at making journalism more inviting and accessible. Crucially, Toff said, journalists need to acknowledge the social context in which people consume news: A voracious news consumer, even when the reporting is grim, may have people in their circle \u201cwho can help them make sense of the news, to work through it together,\u201d he said; the act of discussing press coverage, debating its merits, is bonding. But those who avoid news \u201cdon\u2019t derive any social value from consuming the news,\u201d he continued. He and his colleagues are invested in finding opportunities for them to do so.\n\nLocal outlets may be in the best position to convene audiences for journalism that haven\u2019t yet found their place. A Pew survey released last month shows that nearly all Americans consider local news to be important to their lives\u2014and, notably, they don\u2019t see it as being politically skewed or overly negative. Toff was recently in Odessa, Texas, at a listening session put on by the Texas Tribune, where he was pleasantly surprised to see how people with wildly different viewpoints interacted with one another, at some safe remove from the vitriol of national affairs. \u201cPeople are able to talk civilly to each other in person, even when they disagree, in a way that we assume is impossible,\u201d he said. Recently, Will Lewis, the publisher of the Washington Post, gave a presentation to staff on the paper\u2019s dire financial state (\u201cTo speak candidly: we are in a hole, and we have been for some time,\u201d he said); vowing to repair the situation, he announced a product intended to reach new audiences in the DC metro area, including guides and \u201cexclusive experiences.\u201d\n\nThese endeavors may be painfully earnest; they might not make a difference. \u201cThe problems are pretty deep,\u201d as O\u2019Leary told me, \u201cand I think that most current daily newsrooms are not really reckoning with that.\u201d Still, it\u2019s nice to imagine a version of \u201cnews\u201d that doesn\u2019t immediately conjure up feelings of distress or alienation, a version that feels intimately relevant to the lives of the people who need it, that might even be fun to read. \u201cNews can really help communities reconnect\u2014and we are really in a social-isolation crisis post-COVID,\u201d Ragland said. \u201cOne of the core things that held my generation together is that we wanted to be part of something bigger, and I think we are seeing that collectively now in that communities want to engage in news, but also to engage in the solutions that the news can catalyze.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, we\u2019re stuck with the set pieces that stand in for news during the modern election cycle. A little while after giving up on getting inside the court, I ambled over to Collect Pond Park, which had been designated the legally approved zone for public gatherings and protests. Everything about the setup felt rehearsed: a pen for the pro-Trump folk, another for the protesters, all in easy eyeshot of the pens for the TV correspondents and their crews, clustered on the sidewalk like so many bird droppings.\n\nThere were just a few people milling around in the park, half of them journalists. A reporter from the Times was talking to a Trump backer named Dion Cini, a provocative frequent flier, who was busy unfurling a massive banner that read \u201cTrump or Death.\u201d As he muttered a well-practiced list of talking points (\u201cI don\u2019t mean my death, by the way\u2014I always have to explain this\u201d), he suddenly seemed to realize it was nearing the top of the hour, when the TV correspondents would be delivering their live shots. He whipped around to face the row of cameras. \u201cGet your morning shots!\u201d he yelled, leaning over the railing and pointing at his giant flag. \u201cGet your morning hits in! Get your B-roll!\u201d He knew what they wanted, and he was going to give it to them. The producers turned around and pulled out their phones to capture the moment.\n\nHas America ever needed a media defender more than now?

        "text": "EU elections: What the European results and far-right surge tells us\nIn Brussels, at past EU leaders\u2019 summits, Emmanuel Macron has at times been accused of trying to steal the limelight.\n\nHe certainly managed that on Sunday night. Although probably not in the way he\u2019d have liked.\n\nAs votes for the European Parliament were still being counted, Mr Macron dominated the headlines.\n\nHis drubbing in the poll by French hard-right nationalists had been expected. His decision to dissolve France\u2019s national parliament as a result, came as a shock.\n\nHe had played with the idea last year, after getting trounced in France\u2019s last general election but few expected this move now.\n\nIt\u2019s a huge gamble. From a position of weakness.\n\nEmmanuel Macron describes himself as a centrist and a passionate European.\n\nThis snap general election, taking place in two rounds on 30 June and 7 July, could result in him having to work alongside a French prime minister from the Eurosceptic far right.\n\nMarine Le Pen, regularly portrayed as his political nemesis, declared on Sunday that her party was ready to govern.\n\nIt\u2019s happened before in France that the president, who is the country\u2019s most powerful politician, and the prime minister, hail from different political parties.\n\nBut if the new prime minister were to come from the far right, that would be a first for France.\n\nMarine Le Pen has worked hard in recent years to try to broaden the appeal of her political movement and to soften its extremist image.\n\nShe and her supporters hope this significant victory at EU level (her National Rally party garnered more than double the number of votes of President Macron\u2019s Renaissance party) will translate into huge wins in the snap election back home.\n\nHer dream would be that those successes would then bring her, or her hugely popular prodigee, the 28-year-old Jordan Bardella, a big stride closer to eventually becoming French president - something she\u2019s attempted and failed to achieve a number of times before. The next presidential vote in France is scheduled for 2027.",

        "text": "Fox News projects Trump victory in Pennsylvania\nPHILADELPHIA: Fox News projected that Republican Donald Trump has won the battleground state of Pennsylvania, which would all but close off Democrat Kamala Harris\u2019 chances of winning the U.S. presidency.\n\nOther networks and data providers had yet to make a call in the state.\n\nTrump has already won the swing states of North Carolina and Georgia in Tuesday\u2019s U.S. presidential election, according to Edison Research, taking him closer to completing a stunning political comeback four years after he left the White House.\n\nHe was showing strength across broad swaths of the country. The former president was headed to a convention center near his home in Palm Beach, Florida, to address supporters, a campaign aide told Reuters.\n\nRepublicans won a U.S. Senate majority after flipping Democratic seats in West Virginia and Ohio. Neither party appeared to have an edge in the fight for control of the House of Representatives where Republicans currently hold a narrow majority.\n\nTrump went into Election Day with a 50-50 chance of reclaiming the White House, a remarkable turnaround from Jan. 6, 2021, when many pundits pronounced his political career to be over. That day, a mob of his supporters stormed Congress in a violent attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nTrump picked up more support from Hispanics, traditionally Democratic voters, and among lower-income households that have keenly felt the sting of price rises since the last presidential election in 2020, according to exit polls from Edison.\n\nTrump won 45% of Hispanic voters nationwide, trailing Harris with 53% but up 13 percentage points from 2020.\n\nAbout 31% of voters said the economy was their top issue, and they voted for Trump by a 79%-to-20% margin, according to exit polls. Some 45% of voters across the country said their family\u2019s financial situation was worse off today than four years ago, and they favored Trump 80% to 17%.\n\nGlobal investors were increasingly pricing in a Trump win late on Tuesday. U.S. stock futures and the dollar pushed higher, while Treasury yields climbed and bitcoin rose - all flagged by analysts and investors as trades that favor a Trump victory.\n\n\u201cOur county-by-county analysis in key states suggests that Harris is lagging vs 2020, and on this basis it is logical that the market is starting to price a Trump win, as seen in bonds, and the dollar,\u201c said Jens Nordvig, CEO at analytical firm Exante.\n\nAt Howard University, where a large watch party was being held for Harris, supporters were leaving in droves, anticipating that the vice president would not address the crowd on Tuesday night.\n\nCedric Richmond, a co-chair of the Harris campaign, briefly addressed the crowd, and said Harris would not speak. \u201cWe still have votes to count,\u201c he said. \u201cWe still have states that haven\u2019t been called yet.\u201d\n\nTRUMP OUTPERFORMS 2020\n\nTrump was earning a bigger share of the vote than he did four years ago in nearly every corner of the country, from suburban Georgia to rural Pennsylvania.\n\nBy 12:30 a.m. ET, officials had nearly completed their count of ballots in more than 1,600 counties \u2013 about half the country \u2013 and Trump\u2019s share was up about 2 percentage points compared to 2020, reflecting a broad if not especially deep shift in Americans\u2019 support for the president they ousted four years ago.\n\nHe improved his numbers in suburban counties, rural regions and even some large cities that are historically bastions of Democratic support; in high-income counties and low-income ones; and in places where unemployment was comparatively high and in places where it is now at record lows.\n\nHarris had banked on urban and suburban voters, but her support in those places was running well behind Biden\u2019s.\n\nNearly three-quarters of voters said American democracy is under threat, according to the exit polls, underscoring the depth of polarization in a nation where divisions have only grown starker during a fiercely competitive race.\n\nTrump employed increasingly apocalyptic rhetoric while stoking unfounded fears that the election system cannot be trusted. Harris warned that a second Trump term would threaten the underpinnings of American democracy.\n\nHours before polls closed, Trump claimed on his Truth Social site without evidence that there was \u201ca lot of talk about massive CHEATING\u201d in Philadelphia, echoing his false claims in 2020 that fraud had occurred in large, Democratic-dominated cities. In a subsequent post, he also asserted there was fraud in Detroit.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t respond to nonsense,\u201c Detroit City Clerk Janice Winfrey told Reuters.\n\nA Philadelphia city commissioner, Seth Bluestein, replied on X, \u201cThere is absolutely no truth to this allegation.\u201d\n\nDIZZYING CAMPAIGN\n\nTrump voted earlier near his home in Palm Beach, Florida.\n\n\u201cIf I lose an election, if it\u2019s a fair election, I\u2019m gonna be the first one to acknowledge it,\u201c Trump told reporters.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk, a prominent Trump backer, watched the results at Mar-a-Lago with Trump.\n\nMillions of Americans waited in orderly lines to cast ballots, with only sporadic disruptions reported across a handful of states, including several non-credible bomb threats that the FBI said appeared to originate from Russian email domains.\n\nTuesday\u2019s vote capped a dizzying race churned by unprecedented events, including two assassination attempts against Trump, President Joe Biden\u2019s surprise withdrawal and Harris\u2019 rapid rise.\n\nNo matter who wins, history will be made.\n\nHarris, 60, the first female vice president, would become the first woman, Black woman and South Asian American to win the presidency. Trump, 78, the only president to be impeached twice and the first former president to be criminally convicted, would also become the first president to win non-consecutive terms in more than a century.",

        "text": "Trump claims victory over Harris in US presidential election\nWASHINGTON: Donald Trump claimed victory and pledged to \u201cheal\u201d the country Wednesday as results put him on the verge of beating Kamala Harris in a stunning White House comeback.\n\nHis exuberant speech came despite the fact that only Fox News had declared him the winner, with no other US networks having made the call so far.\n\nAs jubilant supporters cheered and chanted \u201cUSA\u201d, Trump took to the stage at his campaign headquarters in Florida along with his wife Melania and several of his children.\n\n\u201cWe are going to help our country heal,\u201c the Republican former president said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a political victory that our country has never seen before.\u201d\n\nALSO READ: Trump on verge of victory over Harris\n\nUS networks have called the swing states of Pennsylvania, Georgia and North Carolina for the 78-year-old, and he led the Democratic vice president in the others although they have not been called yet.\n\nGloom swiftly descended on Harris\u2019s camp.\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t hear from the vice president tonight but you will hear from her tomorrow,\u201c Cedric Richmond, Harris campaign co-chair, told a watch party in Washington as supporters left.\n\nIn a further blow to Democrats, Trump\u2019s Republican Party also seized control of the Senate, flipping two seats to overturn a narrow Democratic majority.\n\nA Trump victory threatens to cause shockwaves around the world, as US allies in Europe and Asia fear a return of his nationalist policies and his praise of autocrats like Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin.\n\nBut the US dollar surged and bitcoin hit a record high while most equity markets advanced as traders bet on a victory for Trump as the results rolled in.\n\nMood shift\n\nPolls for weeks had shown a knife-edge race between Harris and Trump, who would be the oldest ever president at the time of inauguration, the first felon president and only the second in history to serve non-consecutive terms.\n\nTrump also faces sentencing in a criminal case over hush money payments on November 26, while the controversy over his denial of his 2020 election defeat by Joe Biden still persists.\n\nBut in the end victory came surprisingly quickly.\n\nThe mood shifted sharply at Harris\u2019s watch party in Howard University -- her former college and a historically Black university in Washington -- as the results came in.\n\n\u201cI am scared,\u201c said Charlyn Anderson. \u201cI am anxious now. I am leaving, my legs can barely move.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, the celebrations intensified at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida and the watch party nearby.\n\nTech tycoon Elon Musk, who has backed Trump and stands to lead a government efficiency commission under him, posted a picture of himself with the Republican.\n\n\u201cGame, set and match,\u201c Musk said on X, the social media network he owns along with the Tesla electric vehicle firm and the Space X company.\n\nMillions of Americans had lined up throughout Election Day -- and millions more voted early -- in a race with momentous consequences for the United States and the world.\n\nThey were deciding whether to either hand a historic comeback to Trump or make Harris the first woman in the world\u2019s most powerful job.\n\nIn a stark reminder of the tension -- and fears of outright violence -- dozens of bomb threats were made against polling stations in Georgia and Pennsylvania.\n\nThe FBI said the threats appeared to originate in Russia, which is accused by Washington of trying to meddle in the election. The threats were all hoaxes but succeeded in disrupting proceedings.\n\nDark rhetoric\n\nHarris, 60, had aiming to be only the second Black and first person of South Asian descent to be president.\n\nShe made a dramatic entrance into the race when Biden dropped out in July, while Trump -- twice impeached while president -- has since ridden out two assassination attempts and a criminal conviction.\n\nShe hammered home her message that Trump was a threat to democracy and her opposition to Trump-backed abortion bans.\n\nTrump has vowed an unprecedented deportation campaign of millions of undocumented immigrants, in a campaign full of dark rhetoric.\n\nThe election is being watched closely around the world including in the war zones of Ukraine and the Middle East. Trump has indicated he will cut aid to Kyiv\u2019s battle against the Russian invasion.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE: Fox News projects Trump victory in Pennsylvania\n\n\n\n: Trump wins North Carolina, Georgia, narrowing Harris\u2019 possible path to victory\n\n\n\n: Trump takes lead in US presidential race but battleground states still too close to call",

        "text": "American Public Disapproval of the Israel-Hamas War and the U.S. Presidential Election\nThe U.S. presidential election, a rematch between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, is in full swing. President Biden, who has remained unpopular throughout his term domestically, is caught in a \u2018two wars\u2019 dilemma internationally. Some argue that uncertainty has increased over President Biden\u2019s re-election due to a series of foreign policy failures in the Ukraine and Gaza wars. This means that, excluding the Iraq War, which turned into a severe social problem in America in 2008, foreign issues might be an important factor in the U.S. presidential election. This is an interesting claim as it has never been before.\nAs the war between Israel and Hamas continues, the claim that foreign policy issues will become critical in the 2024 presidential election needs to be closely examined. This Issue Brief analyzes multiple polling data to estimate the impact of foreign issues, such as the Israel-Hamas war, on Americans\u2019 vote choices.\nAccording to several polls published to date, some young progressive voters, who are traditional supporters of the Democratic Party, disapprove President Biden\u2019s response to the Israel-Hamas war and tend to withdraw their support as a result.\n\nFigure 1. Americans\u2019 view of the U.S. response to the Israel-Hamas war (%)\n\nIn December 2023, the Pew Research Center revealed that only 35% of Americans approved President Biden\u2019s response to the Israel-Hamas war (41% disapprove, 24% don\u2019t know). The older people are more likely to support President Biden. For example, 50% of those over 65 supported his response to the war, while 46% and 43% of young people in their 20s and 30s, respectively, viewed it negatively (see Figure 1). In particular, only 19% of people in their 20s supported President Biden\u2019s response to the war. It is clear that there is a dissatisfaction with President Biden\u2019s response to the war, especially among young people.\nAccording to another survey by Pew Research Center conducted in April 2024, young Americans sympathized more with Palestinians than with Israelis (18~29 years old: 33%), and 60% favored Palestinians (46% favored Israelis). This was noticeable among young people who support the Democratic Party (sympathy: 47%, favorability: 76%). Pro-Israel views are still common among Americans, but in the late 2000s, the perception of Palestine among young people (18~29 years old) had clearly been improved.\nThis is because young people more easily and frequently encounter foreign policy issues through social media and are more likely to sympathize with the humanitarian crisis caused by war. They grew up with exposure to movements such as \u2018Occupy Wall Street\u2019, \u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019, and students\u2019 gun control campaigns. As civilian casualties rapidly increased in Gaza, a pro-Palestinian anti-war movement was organized around 50 campuses, including Columbia University, the University of Michigan, and UCLA.\n\nHowever, the approval rating for President Biden did not decline. In fact, President Biden\u2019s approval rating has remained around 40% since falling in the third quarter of 2021 and has remained unchanged since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war in October 2023.\n\nFigure 2. President Biden\u2019s approval rating (%)\n\nAccording to another survey by Pew Research Center conducted in April 2024, young Americans sympathized more with Palestinians than with Israelis (18~29 years old: 33%), and 60% favored Palestinians (46% favored Israelis). This was noticeable among young people who support the Democratic Party (sympathy: 47%, favorability: 76%). Pro-Israel views are still common among Americans, but in the late 2000s, the perception of Palestine among young people (18~29 years old) had clearly been improved.\nIn the early days of the war, the Biden administration opposed a ceasefire and sided with Israel, even though civilian casualties increased due to Israel\u2019s massive bombing and collective punishment of the Gaza Strip to destroy Hamas. As a result, turmoil was detected among the young, progressive Democratic Party supporters who contributed to President Biden\u2019s election in 2020. Also, starting in October 2023, many Arab and Muslim community leaders, beginning in Minnesota, began campaigning to abandon and defeat President Biden, who did not call for a ceasefire in the war. During the 2020 presidential election, President Biden won seven swing states, including Minnesota, Michigan, Arizona, Wisconsin, Florida, Georgia, Nevada, and Pennsylvania, where campaigns against him are currently taking place.\n\nTable 1. President Biden\u2019s rating for his handling of major policy issues (%)\n\nWhen we see the approvals of President Biden and his administration by specific policies, low scores were observed in foreign policy and responses to the Middle East situation. According to Table 1, which summarizes a Gallup survey in March 2024, 46% and 42% approved the environmental and energy policies, respectively, exceeding the overall average (40%). On the other hand, the economy and diplomacy fell below the overall average, with only 37% and 33%, respectively, giving an approval. The lowest approval was in President Biden\u2019s response to Middle East issues between Israel and Palestine (approval: 27%).\nIndeed, the general American voter does not consider external issues as a determining factor when deciding their vote choices. In April 2024, Americans\u2019 major national issues were inflation (35%), immigration (35%), economy and jobs (26%), gun control (17%), crime rate (15%), and healthcare (15%), abortion rights (14%), while only 5% each said foreign policy and the war between Israel and Hamas were important. In Seoul, in May 2024, Mike Pompeo, who served as Secretary of State during the Trump administration, also said that in the presidential election, inflation and immigration at the southern border, rather than external issues, would be decisive in voters\u2019 choices.\nThe Iraq War was a key issue in the 2008 U.S. presidential election. However, rather than an external issue, this was due to the serious social problems caused by post-traumatic stress disorder among veterans at the time. The decisive factor in President Carter\u2019s failure to be re-elected in 1980 was the failure of economic policy due to high inflation rather than the foreign policy crisis.\nAs a result of the analysis, the observation that the Israel-Hamas war ahead of this year\u2019s presidential election made President Biden\u2019s re-election uncertain was not clearly supported in the polling data. When deciding which candidate to support, American voters viewed domestic issues such as immigration, inflation, the economy and jobs, gun control, crime rate, healthcare, and abortion rights as more important than external issues. In addition, progressive young people also responded in a public opinion poll, saying, \u201cI dislike both candidates, but I have greater antipathy toward candidate Trump.\u201d\n\nAccording to public opinion polls so far, young American voters have given negative evaluations to the U.S. response to the Israel-Hamas war, but President Biden\u2019s approval rating has not declined since the war. Although they criticized President Biden\u2019s policy toward the Middle East, it is hard to assume that young constituents have completely withdrawn their support for him. Currently, it seems unlikely that young people\u2019s evaluations of specific external issues will emerge as a key variable that will determine the future U.S. presidential election.\nMoreover, the Biden administration sharply changed its position to support an immediate ceasefire, expand humanitarian aid to Palestine, and increase pressure on Israel. As a result, the anti-war movement among young people, which was believed to be a negative factor in President Biden\u2019s re-election bid, is also expected to subside after March 2024.\nPresident Biden criticized the anti-war movement as anti-Semitic but expressed a neutral stance in support of freedom of expression in universities. Accordingly, the anti-war movement appears to have lost momentum and is faltering. Anti-war public sentiment has also weakened, and according to a May 2024 survey by The Economist and YouGov, only 28% of Americans said they supported anti-war protests (47% opposed). The reasons for the decline in approval of the anti-war movement is that it is increasingly viewed as having strayed from its initial cause \u2014criticism of Hamas \u2014and as inciting violence on campus.\nIn this regard, the prediction that the war between Israel and Hamas will have a detrimental effect on President Biden in the U.S. presidential election seems premature.\n\n\nCenter for Regional Studies\nDr. JANG Ji-Hyang is a Principal Fellow and director of the Center for Regional Studies at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies.

President Biden, who has remained unpopular throughout his term domestically, is caught in a \u2018two wars\u2019 dilemma internationally.

They grew up with exposure to movements such as \u2018Occupy Wall Street\u2019, \u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019, and students\u2019 gun control campaigns. As civilian casualties rapidly increased in Gaza, a pro-Palestinian anti-war movement was organized around 50 campuses, including Columbia University, the University of Michigan, and UCLA.\n\u00a0\nPresident Biden\u2019s Approval Rating Unchanged Despite the Israel-Hamas War\n\u00a0\nHowever, the approval rating for President Biden did not decline. In fact, President Biden\u2019s approval rating has remained around 40% since falling in the third quarter of 2021 and has remained unchanged since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war in October 2023.\n\u00a0\nFigure 2. President Biden\u2019s approval rating (%)\n\n\u00a0\nAccording to another survey by Pew Research Center conducted in April 2024, young Americans sympathized more with Palestinians than with Israelis (18~29 years old: 33%), and 60% favored Palestinians (46% favored Israelis). This was noticeable among young people who support the Democratic Party (sympathy: 47%, favorability: 76%). Pro-Israel views are still common among Americans, but in the late 2000s, the perception of Palestine among young people (18~29 years old) had clearly been improved.\nIn the early days of the war, the Biden administration opposed a ceasefire and sided with Israel, even though civilian casualties increased due to Israel\u2019s massive bombing and collective punishment of the Gaza Strip to destroy Hamas. As a result, turmoil was detected among the young, progressive Democratic Party supporters who contributed to President Biden\u2019s election in 2020. Also, starting in October 2023, many Arab and Muslim community leaders, beginning in Minnesota, began campaigning to abandon and defeat President Biden, who did not call for a ceasefire in the war. During the 2020 presidential election, President Biden won seven swing states, including Minnesota, Michigan, Arizona, Wisconsin, Florida, Georgia, Nevada, and Pennsylvania, where campaigns against him are currently taking place.\n\u00a0\nTable 1. President Biden\u2019s rating for his handling of major policy issues (%)\n\n\u00a0\nWhen we see the approvals of President Biden and his administration by specific policies, low scores were observed in foreign policy and responses to the Middle East situation. According to Table 1, which summarizes a Gallup survey in March 2024, 46% and 42% approved the environmental and energy policies, respectively, exceeding the overall average (40%). On the other hand, the economy and diplomacy fell below the overall average, with only 37% and 33%, respectively, giving an approval. The lowest approval was in President Biden\u2019s response to Middle East issues between Israel and Palestine (approval: 27%).\nIndeed, the general American voter does not consider external issues as a determining factor when deciding their vote choices. In April 2024, Americans\u2019 major national issues were inflation (35%), immigration (35%), economy and jobs (26%), gun control (17%), crime rate (15%), and healthcare (15%), abortion rights (14%), while only 5% each said foreign policy and the war between Israel and Hamas were important. In Seoul, in May 2024, Mike Pompeo, who served as Secretary of State during the Trump administration, also said that in the presidential election, inflation and immigration at the southern border, rather than external issues, would be decisive in voters\u2019 choices.\nThe Iraq War was a key issue in the 2008 U.S. presidential election. However, rather than an external issue, this was due to the serious social problems caused by post-traumatic stress disorder among veterans at the time. The decisive factor in President Carter\u2019s failure to be re-elected in 1980 was the failure of economic policy due to high inflation rather than the foreign policy crisis.\nAs a result of the analysis, the observation that the Israel-Hamas war ahead of this year\u2019s presidential election made President Biden\u2019s re-election uncertain was not clearly supported in the polling data. When deciding which candidate to support, American voters viewed domestic issues such as immigration, inflation, the economy and jobs, gun control, crime rate, healthcare, and abortion rights as more important than external issues. In addition, progressive young people also responded in a public opinion poll, saying, \u201cI dislike both candidates, but I have greater antipathy toward candidate Trump.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe Prospects of the Anti-War Movement and Young Voters\n\u00a0\nAccording to public opinion polls so far, young American voters have given negative evaluations to the U.S. response to the Israel-Hamas war, but President Biden\u2019s approval rating has not declined since the war. Although they criticized President Biden\u2019s policy toward the Middle East, it is hard to assume that young constituents have completely withdrawn their support for him. Currently, it seems unlikely that young people\u2019s evaluations of specific external issues will emerge as a key variable that will determine the future U.S. presidential election.\nMoreover, the Biden administration sharply changed its position to support an immediate ceasefire, expand humanitarian aid to Palestine, and increase pressure on Israel. As a result, the anti-war movement among young people, which was believed to be a negative factor in President Biden\u2019s re-election bid, is also expected to subside after March 2024.\nPresident Biden criticized the anti-war movement as anti-Semitic but expressed a neutral stance in support of freedom of expression in universities. Accordingly, the anti-war movement appears to have lost momentum and is faltering. Anti-war public sentiment has also weakened, and according to a May 2024 survey by The Economist and YouGov, only 28% of Americans said they supported anti-war protests (47% opposed). The reasons for the decline in approval of the anti-war movement is that it is increasingly viewed as having strayed from its initial cause \u2014criticism of Hamas \u2014and as inciting violence on campus.\nIn this regard, the prediction that the war between Israel and Hamas will have a detrimental effect on President Biden in the U.S. presidential election seems premature.\n\u00a0\n\nThis article is an English Summary of Asan Issue Brief (2024-16).\n(\u2018\ubbf8\uad6d \ub0b4 \uc774\uc2a4\ub77c\uc5d8\u2219\ud558\ub9c8\uc2a4 \uc804\uc7c1 \ubc18\ub300 \uc5ec\ub860\uacfc \ubbf8 \ub300\uc120\u2019, https://www.asaninst.org/?p=94121)\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAbout Experts\n\n\n\nJang Ji-Hyang\nCenter for Regional Studies\nDr. JANG Ji-Hyang is a Principal Fellow and director of the Center for Regional Studies at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies.

Election.pdf \n\n\nsocial share\n\n Facebook\n Twitter\n\nAmericans\u2019 Views on U.S. Policy Toward the Israel-Hamas War: The Turmoil Among Young Progressive Democrats \n\u00a0\nThe U.S. presidential election, a rematch between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, is in full swing. President Biden, who has remained unpopular throughout his term domestically, is caught in a \u2018two wars\u2019 dilemma internationally. Some argue that uncertainty has increased over President Biden\u2019s re-election due to a series of foreign policy failures in the Ukraine and Gaza wars. This means that, excluding the Iraq War, which turned into a severe social problem in America in 2008, foreign issues might be an important factor in the U.S. presidential election. This is an interesting claim as it has never been before.\nAs the war between Israel and Hamas continues, the claim that foreign policy issues will become critical in the 2024 presidential election needs to be closely examined. This Issue Brief analyzes multiple polling data to estimate the impact of foreign issues, such as the Israel-Hamas war, on Americans\u2019 vote choices.\nAccording to several polls published to date, some young progressive voters, who are traditional supporters of the Democratic Party, disapprove President Biden\u2019s response to the Israel-Hamas war and tend to withdraw their support as a result.\n\u00a0\nFigure 1. Americans\u2019 view of the U.S. response to the Israel-Hamas war (%)\n\n\u00a0\nIn December 2023, the Pew Research Center revealed that only 35% of Americans approved President Biden\u2019s response to the Israel-Hamas war (41% disapprove, 24% don\u2019t know). The older people are more likely to support President Biden. For example, 50% of those over 65 supported his response to the war, while 46% and 43% of young people in their 20s and 30s, respectively, viewed it negatively (see Figure 1). In particular, only 19% of people in their 20s supported President Biden\u2019s response to the war. It is clear that there is a dissatisfaction with President Biden\u2019s response to the war, especially among young people.\nAccording to another survey by Pew Research Center conducted in April 2024, young Americans sympathized more with Palestinians than with Israelis (18~29 years old: 33%), and 60% favored Palestinians (46% favored Israelis). This was noticeable among young people who support the Democratic Party (sympathy: 47%, favorability: 76%). Pro-Israel views are still common among Americans, but in the late 2000s, the perception of Palestine among young people (18~29 years old) had clearly been improved.\nThis is because young people more easily and frequently encounter foreign policy issues through social media and are more likely to sympathize with the humanitarian crisis caused by war. They grew up with exposure to movements such as \u2018Occupy Wall Street\u2019, \u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019, and students\u2019 gun control campaigns. As civilian casualties rapidly increased in Gaza, a pro-Palestinian anti-war movement was organized around 50 campuses, including Columbia University, the University of Michigan, and UCLA.\n\u00a0\nPresident Biden\u2019s Approval Rating Unchanged Despite the Israel-Hamas War\n\u00a0\nHowever, the approval rating for President Biden did not decline. In fact, President Biden\u2019s approval rating has remained around 40% since falling in the third quarter of 2021 and has remained unchanged since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war in October 2023.\n\u00a0\nFigure 2.

The reasons for the decline in approval of the anti-war movement is that it is increasingly viewed as having strayed from its initial cause \u2014criticism of Hamas \u2014and as inciting violence on campus.\nIn this regard, the prediction that the war between Israel and Hamas will have a detrimental effect on President Biden in the U.S. presidential election seems premature.\n\u00a0\n\nThis article is an English Summary of Asan Issue Brief (2024-16).\n(\u2018\ubbf8\uad6d \ub0b4 \uc774\uc2a4\ub77c\uc5d8\u2219\ud558\ub9c8\uc2a4 \uc804\uc7c1 \ubc18\ub300 \uc5ec\ub860\uacfc \ubbf8 \ub300\uc120\u2019, https://www.asaninst.org/?p=94121)\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAbout Experts\n\n\n\nJang Ji-Hyang\nCenter for Regional Studies\nDr. JANG Ji-Hyang is a Principal Fellow and director of the Center for Regional Studies at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies.

President Biden, who has remained unpopular throughout his term domestically, is caught in a \u2018two wars\u2019 dilemma internationally. Some argue that uncertainty has increased over President Biden\u2019s re-election due to a series of foreign policy failures in the Ukraine and Gaza wars. This means that, excluding the Iraq War, which turned into a severe social problem in America in 2008, foreign issues might be an important factor in the U.S. presidential election. This is an interesting claim as it has never been before.\nAs the war between Israel and Hamas continues, the claim that foreign policy issues will become critical in the 2024 presidential election needs to be closely examined. This Issue Brief analyzes multiple polling data to estimate the impact of foreign issues, such as the Israel-Hamas war, on Americans\u2019 vote choices.\nAccording to several polls published to date, some young progressive voters, who are traditional supporters of the Democratic Party, disapprove President Biden\u2019s response to the Israel-Hamas war and tend to withdraw their support as a result.\n\u00a0\nFigure 1. Americans\u2019 view of the U.S. response to the Israel-Hamas war (%)\n\n\u00a0\nIn December 2023, the Pew Research Center revealed that only 35% of Americans approved President Biden\u2019s response to the Israel-Hamas war (41% disapprove, 24% don\u2019t know). The older people are more likely to support President Biden. For example, 50% of those over 65 supported his response to the war, while 46% and 43% of young people in their 20s and 30s, respectively, viewed it negatively (see Figure 1). In particular, only 19% of people in their 20s supported President Biden\u2019s response to the war. It is clear that there is a dissatisfaction with President Biden\u2019s response to the war, especially among young people.\nAccording to another survey by Pew Research Center conducted in April 2024, young Americans sympathized more with Palestinians than with Israelis (18~29 years old: 33%), and 60% favored Palestinians (46% favored Israelis). This was noticeable among young people who support the Democratic Party (sympathy: 47%, favorability: 76%). Pro-Israel views are still common among Americans, but in the late 2000s, the perception of Palestine among young people (18~29 years old) had clearly been improved.\nThis is because young people more easily and frequently encounter foreign policy issues through social media and are more likely to sympathize with the humanitarian crisis caused by war. They grew up with exposure to movements such as \u2018Occupy Wall Street\u2019, \u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019, and students\u2019 gun control campaigns. As civilian casualties rapidly increased in Gaza, a pro-Palestinian anti-war movement was organized around 50 campuses, including Columbia University, the University of Michigan, and UCLA.\n\u00a0\nPresident Biden\u2019s Approval Rating Unchanged Despite the Israel-Hamas War\n\u00a0\nHowever, the approval rating for President Biden did not decline. In fact, President Biden\u2019s approval rating has remained around 40% since falling in the third quarter of 2021 and has remained unchanged since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war in October 2023.\n\u00a0\nFigure 2. President Biden\u2019s approval rating (%)\n\n\u00a0\nAccording to another survey by Pew Research Center conducted in April 2024, young Americans sympathized more with Palestinians than with Israelis (18~29 years old: 33%), and 60% favored Palestinians (46% favored Israelis). This was noticeable among young people who support the Democratic Party (sympathy: 47%, favorability: 76%). Pro-Israel views are still common among Americans, but in the late 2000s, the perception of Palestine among young people (18~29 years old) had clearly been improved.\nIn the early days of the war, the Biden administration opposed a ceasefire and sided with Israel, even though civilian casualties increased due to Israel\u2019s massive bombing and collective punishment of the Gaza Strip to destroy Hamas. As a result, turmoil was detected among the young, progressive Democratic Party supporters who contributed to President Biden\u2019s election in 2020. Also, starting in October 2023, many Arab and Muslim community leaders, beginning in Minnesota, began campaigning to abandon and defeat President Biden, who did not call for a ceasefire in the war. During the 2020 presidential election, President Biden won seven swing states, including Minnesota, Michigan, Arizona, Wisconsin, Florida, Georgia, Nevada, and Pennsylvania, where campaigns against him are currently taking place.\n\u00a0\nTable 1. President Biden\u2019s rating for his handling of major policy issues (%)\n\n\u00a0\nWhen we see the approvals of President Biden and his administration by specific policies, low scores were observed in foreign policy and responses to the Middle East situation. According to Table 1, which summarizes a Gallup survey in March 2024, 46% and 42% approved the environmental and energy policies, respectively, exceeding the overall average (40%). On the other hand, the economy and diplomacy fell below the overall average, with only 37% and 33%, respectively, giving an approval. The lowest approval was in President Biden\u2019s response to Middle East issues between Israel and Palestine (approval: 27%).\nIndeed, the general American voter does not consider external issues as a determining factor when deciding their vote choices. In April 2024, Americans\u2019 major national issues were inflation (35%), immigration (35%), economy and jobs (26%), gun control (17%), crime rate (15%), and healthcare (15%), abortion rights (14%), while only 5% each said foreign policy and the war between Israel and Hamas were important. In Seoul, in May 2024, Mike Pompeo, who served as Secretary of State during the Trump administration, also said that in the presidential election, inflation and immigration at the southern border, rather than external issues, would be decisive in voters\u2019 choices.\nThe Iraq War was a key issue in the 2008 U.S. presidential election. However, rather than an external issue, this was due to the serious social problems caused by post-traumatic stress disorder among veterans at the time. The decisive factor in President Carter\u2019s failure to be re-elected in 1980 was the failure of economic policy due to high inflation rather than the foreign policy crisis.\nAs a result of the analysis, the observation that the Israel-Hamas war ahead of this year\u2019s presidential election made President Biden\u2019s re-election uncertain was not clearly supported in the polling data. When deciding which candidate to support, American voters viewed domestic issues such as immigration, inflation, the economy and jobs, gun control, crime rate, healthcare, and abortion rights as more important than external issues. In addition, progressive young people also responded in a public opinion poll, saying, \u201cI dislike both candidates, but I have greater antipathy toward candidate Trump.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe Prospects of the Anti-War Movement and Young Voters\n\u00a0\nAccording to public opinion polls so far, young American voters have given negative evaluations to the U.S. response to the Israel-Hamas war, but President Biden\u2019s approval rating has not declined since the war. Although they criticized President Biden\u2019s policy toward the Middle East, it is hard to assume that young constituents have completely withdrawn their support for him. Currently, it seems unlikely that young people\u2019s evaluations of specific external issues will emerge as a key variable that will determine the future U.S. presidential election.\nMoreover, the Biden administration sharply changed its position to support an immediate ceasefire, expand humanitarian aid to Palestine, and increase pressure on Israel. As a result, the anti-war movement among young people, which was believed to be a negative factor in President Biden\u2019s re-election bid, is also expected to subside after March 2024.\nPresident Biden criticized the anti-war movement as anti-Semitic but expressed a neutral stance in support of freedom of expression in universities. Accordingly, the anti-war movement appears to have lost momentum and is faltering. Anti-war public sentiment has also weakened, and according to a May 2024 survey by The Economist and YouGov, only 28% of Americans said they supported anti-war protests (47% opposed). The reasons for the decline in approval of the anti-war movement is that it is increasingly viewed as having strayed from its initial cause \u2014criticism of Hamas \u2014and as inciting violence on campus.\nIn this regard, the prediction that the war between Israel and Hamas will have a detrimental effect on President Biden in the U.S. presidential election seems premature.\n\u00a0\n\nThis article is an English Summary of Asan Issue Brief (2024-16).\n(\u2018\ubbf8\uad6d \ub0b4 \uc774\uc2a4\ub77c\uc5d8\u2219\ud558\ub9c8\uc2a4 \uc804\uc7c1 \ubc18\ub300 \uc5ec\ub860\uacfc \ubbf8 \ub300\uc120\u2019, https://www.asaninst.org/?p=94121)\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAbout Experts\n\n\n\nJang Ji-Hyang\nCenter for Regional Studies\nDr. JANG Ji-Hyang is a Principal Fellow and director of the Center for Regional Studies at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies.

President Biden, who has remained unpopular throughout his term domestically, is caught in a \u2018two wars\u2019 dilemma internationally. Some argue that uncertainty has increased over President Biden\u2019s re-election due to a series of foreign policy failures in the Ukraine and Gaza wars. This means that, excluding the Iraq War, which turned into a severe social problem in America in 2008, foreign issues might be an important factor in the U.S. presidential election. This is an interesting claim as it has never been before.\nAs the war between Israel and Hamas continues, the claim that foreign policy issues will become critical in the 2024 presidential election needs to be closely examined. This Issue Brief analyzes multiple polling data to estimate the impact of foreign issues, such as the Israel-Hamas war, on Americans\u2019 vote choices.\nAccording to several polls published to date, some young progressive voters, who are traditional supporters of the Democratic Party, disapprove President Biden\u2019s response to the Israel-Hamas war and tend to withdraw their support as a result.\n\u00a0\nFigure 1. Americans\u2019 view of the U.S. response to the Israel-Hamas war (%)\n\n\u00a0\nIn December 2023, the Pew Research Center revealed that only 35% of Americans approved President Biden\u2019s response to the Israel-Hamas war (41% disapprove, 24% don\u2019t know). The older people are more likely to support President Biden. For example, 50% of those over 65 supported his response to the war, while 46% and 43% of young people in their 20s and 30s, respectively, viewed it negatively (see Figure 1). In particular, only 19% of people in their 20s supported President Biden\u2019s response to the war. It is clear that there is a dissatisfaction with President Biden\u2019s response to the war, especially among young people.\nAccording to another survey by Pew Research Center conducted in April 2024, young Americans sympathized more with Palestinians than with Israelis (18~29 years old: 33%), and 60% favored Palestinians (46% favored Israelis). This was noticeable among young people who support the Democratic Party (sympathy: 47%, favorability: 76%). Pro-Israel views are still common among Americans, but in the late 2000s, the perception of Palestine among young people (18~29 years old) had clearly been improved.\nThis is because young people more easily and frequently encounter foreign policy issues through social media and are more likely to sympathize with the humanitarian crisis caused by war. They grew up with exposure to movements such as \u2018Occupy Wall Street\u2019, \u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019, and students\u2019 gun control campaigns. As civilian casualties rapidly increased in Gaza, a pro-Palestinian anti-war movement was organized around 50 campuses, including Columbia University, the University of Michigan, and UCLA.\n\u00a0\nPresident Biden\u2019s Approval Rating Unchanged Despite the Israel-Hamas War\n\u00a0\nHowever, the approval rating for President Biden did not decline. In fact, President Biden\u2019s approval rating has remained around 40% since falling in the third quarter of 2021 and has remained unchanged since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war in October 2023.\n\u00a0\nFigure 2. President Biden\u2019s approval rating (%)\n\n\u00a0\nAccording to another survey by Pew Research Center conducted in April 2024, young Americans sympathized more with Palestinians than with Israelis (18~29 years old: 33%), and 60% favored Palestinians (46% favored Israelis). This was noticeable among young people who support the Democratic Party (sympathy: 47%, favorability: 76%). Pro-Israel views are still common among Americans, but in the late 2000s, the perception of Palestine among young people (18~29 years old) had clearly been improved.\nIn the early days of the war, the Biden administration opposed a ceasefire and sided with Israel, even though civilian casualties increased due to Israel\u2019s massive bombing and collective punishment of the Gaza Strip to destroy Hamas. As a result, turmoil was detected among the young, progressive Democratic Party supporters who contributed to President Biden\u2019s election in 2020. Also, starting in October 2023, many Arab and Muslim community leaders, beginning in Minnesota, began campaigning to abandon and defeat President Biden, who did not call for a ceasefire in the war. During the 2020 presidential election, President Biden won seven swing states, including Minnesota, Michigan, Arizona, Wisconsin, Florida, Georgia, Nevada, and Pennsylvania, where campaigns against him are currently taking place.\n\u00a0\nTable 1. President Biden\u2019s rating for his handling of major policy issues (%)\n\n\u00a0\nWhen we see the approvals of President Biden and his administration by specific policies, low scores were observed in foreign policy and responses to the Middle East situation. According to Table 1, which summarizes a Gallup survey in March 2024, 46% and 42% approved the environmental and energy policies, respectively, exceeding the overall average (40%). On the other hand, the economy and diplomacy fell below the overall average, with only 37% and 33%, respectively, giving an approval. The lowest approval was in President Biden\u2019s response to Middle East issues between Israel and Palestine (approval: 27%).\nIndeed, the general American voter does not consider external issues as a determining factor when deciding their vote choices. In April 2024, Americans\u2019 major national issues were inflation (35%), immigration (35%), economy and jobs (26%), gun control (17%), crime rate (15%), and healthcare (15%), abortion rights (14%), while only 5% each said foreign policy and the war between Israel and Hamas were important. In Seoul, in May 2024, Mike Pompeo, who served as Secretary of State during the Trump administration, also said that in the presidential election, inflation and immigration at the southern border, rather than external issues, would be decisive in voters\u2019 choices.\nThe Iraq War was a key issue in the 2008 U.S. presidential election. However, rather than an external issue, this was due to the serious social problems caused by post-traumatic stress disorder among veterans at the time. The decisive factor in President Carter\u2019s failure to be re-elected in 1980 was the failure of economic policy due to high inflation rather than the foreign policy crisis.\nAs a result of the analysis, the observation that the Israel-Hamas war ahead of this year\u2019s presidential election made President Biden\u2019s re-election uncertain was not clearly supported in the polling data. When deciding which candidate to support, American voters viewed domestic issues such as immigration, inflation, the economy and jobs, gun control, crime rate, healthcare, and abortion rights as more important than external issues. In addition, progressive young people also responded in a public opinion poll, saying, \u201cI dislike both candidates, but I have greater antipathy toward candidate Trump.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe Prospects of the Anti-War Movement and Young Voters\n\u00a0\nAccording to public opinion polls so far, young American voters have given negative evaluations to the U.S. response to the Israel-Hamas war, but President Biden\u2019s approval rating has not declined since the war. Although they criticized President Biden\u2019s policy toward the Middle East, it is hard to assume that young constituents have completely withdrawn their support for him. Currently, it seems unlikely that young people\u2019s evaluations of specific external issues will emerge as a key variable that will determine the future U.S. presidential election.\nMoreover, the Biden administration sharply changed its position to support an immediate ceasefire, expand humanitarian aid to Palestine, and increase pressure on Israel. As a result, the anti-war movement among young people, which was believed to be a negative factor in President Biden\u2019s re-election bid, is also expected to subside after March 2024.\nPresident Biden criticized the anti-war movement as anti-Semitic but expressed a neutral stance in support of freedom of expression in universities. Accordingly, the anti-war movement appears to have lost momentum and is faltering. Anti-war public sentiment has also weakened, and according to a May 2024 survey by The Economist and YouGov, only 28% of Americans said they supported anti-war protests (47% opposed). The reasons for the decline in approval of the anti-war movement is that it is increasingly viewed as having strayed from its initial cause \u2014criticism of Hamas \u2014and as inciting violence on campus.\nIn this regard, the prediction that the war between Israel and Hamas will have a detrimental effect on President Biden in the U.S. presidential election seems premature.\n\u00a0\n\nThis article is an English Summary of Asan Issue Brief (2024-16).\n(\u2018\ubbf8\uad6d \ub0b4 \uc774\uc2a4\ub77c\uc5d8\u2219\ud558\ub9c8\uc2a4 \uc804\uc7c1 \ubc18\ub300 \uc5ec\ub860\uacfc \ubbf8 \ub300\uc120\u2019, https://www.asaninst.org/?p=94121)\nsocial share\n\n Facebook\n Twitter\nThis article is an English Summary of Asan Issue Brief (2024-16).\n(\u2018\ubbf8\uad6d \ub0b4 \uc774\uc2a4\ub77c\uc5d8\u2219\ud558\ub9c8\uc2a4 \uc804\uc7c1 \ubc18\ub300 \uc5ec\ub860\uacfc \ubbf8 \ub300\uc120\u2019, https://www.asaninst.org/?p=94121)\n\nAbout Experts\n\n\n\nJang Ji-Hyang\nCenter for Regional Studies\nDr. JANG Ji-Hyang is a Principal Fellow and director of the Center for Regional Studies at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies.

So far, it doesn't look like he is.\n\nKennedy\u2019s chance of winning the presidency is essentially nil, and has not improved much as more Americans hear about him. His net favorability \u2014 the difference between the percentage of Americans who have a very or somewhat favorable view of him and the percentage who view him unfavorably \u2014 has dropped 25 points from +12 in January to -13 in June. Only a small portion of Americans intend to vote for Kennedy for president. Over the past several months, his support has increased from 2% of registered voters to 4%, but this rise is within the margin of error and far outside the level of a contender.",

        "text": "ABC News Announcement: All-New Forecasting Model for the 2024 Presidential Election.\nABC News announced that its renowned data journalism organization, 538, launched its all-new forecasting model for the 2024 presidential election. The model will constantly update with newly approved polls as they publish updates based on key indicators, including the polls' historical accuracy and methodological transparency. The tool will examine how reliable polling and other data are at predicting election outcomes from today through election day 2024.\n\nSEE WHO IS FAVORED TO WIN THE 2024 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION\n\nThe model is available on ABCNews.com/538, along with a detailed methodology explaining how the model was built from the ground up. Widget integrations will be available on the website's home page in the coming weeks.\n\n\"The forecast formalizes our theories of voter behavior, uncertainty in the polls, and other factors,\" said G. Elliott Morris, editorial director of data analytics for ABC News. \"It asks how likely either candidate is to win the election, given their position in the polls, the time remaining until election day, and how accurate the polls have been in the past. It's a unique new way of using various data to answer the question: How much should I trust these polls?\"\n\nThe initial forecast reflects a very close race between incumbent President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump. The race remains especially close in key swing states, with Trump leading current polls in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona, Nevada and Georgia.\n\nThe model also makes forecasts for major third-party candidates, including Robert F Kennedy Jr., who currently has a significant chance of affecting the election outcome. However, there is still a lot of uncertainty in the forecast at this stage of the campaign.\n\nForthcoming 538 articles based on the model will spotlight regular election updates on where the race stands, the fundamental indicators of the race, and how reliable the polls are at forecasting outcomes over time. 538 will also report on how the model estimates polls change from now to the conventions and election day, as well as polling bias and how the model processes it, and a comparison of what the model says today versus what it determined at this point in previous presidential elections years, including 2020, 2016, 2012 and more.\n\nAbout 538: ABC News' 538 is a trusted data journalism source for poll aggregation and election-forecasting models for U.S. elections, political reporting and more. 538's models and polling data are used across ABC News' broadcast, streaming and digital channels.",

        "text": "North Dakota sets age limit for US Congressional candidates\nNorth Dakota sets age limit for Congress candidates\n\nThe measure prevents older candidates from appearing on ballots. If a court ruling requires someone to appear on a ballot, the ballot will also include their expected age at the end of the term.\n\nIt passed among voters in one of the least populated US states on Tuesday with a majority of votes - 61%. Nearly 40% of voters opposed it.\n\nThe ballot measure changes the state's constitution to bar North Dakota candidates from representing the state in the US House or Senate if they turn 81 by 31 December of the year when their term ends.\n\nVoters in North Dakota have approved a new candidate age limit that would prevent anyone from running for Congress if they turn 81 during their term.\n\nNorth Dakota's current congressional delegation will not be impacted by the measure. Sen. John Hoeven is the oldest member of the group at 67.\n\nVoters' approval of the law is one of the first measurable indicators of how Americans feel about the age of their representatives.\n\nThe issue is in the spotlight ahead of the November presidential election, when voters will choose between US President Joe Biden, who is 81, and former US President Donald Trump, who is turning 78 this week.\n\nRegardless of which candidates wins, they would become the oldest serving US president - a title President Biden currently holds.\n\nHowever, the North Dakota ballot measure is likely to face legal challenges.\n\nThe US Constitution says senators must be at least 30 years old and members of the House at least 25 years old. There are no term limits or retirement requirements for Congress.\n\nThe US Supreme Court ruled in 1995 that states do not have the authority to establish eligibility rules for congressional candidates. The decision, U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, determined that states can not impose additional restrictions on federal government representatives beyond what is included in the US Constitution.\n\nThe Supreme Court separately affirmed that states cannot set their own requirements for national office in March, when it rejected an effort to remove Trump from Colorado's primary ballot.\n\nThe North Dakota Attorney General's office estimated the age limit measure could lead to an estimated $1m (\u00a3780,000) in litigation costs.\n\nThere are currently three senators older than age 80 - Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, 82, a Republican from Kentucky; Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, 82; and Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, 90.\n\nMr McConnell garnered attention last year after several episodes in which he appeared to freeze in front of TV cameras, raising questions about his health and competency. Mr McConnell has said he is \"completely recovered\" after the episodes.\n\nAt least 10 current House members are older than 80, including Democrat Steny Hoyer of Maryland, 84; Democrat Nancy Pelosi of California, 84 and Democrat James Clyburn of South Carolina, 83.",

        "text": "What is Project 2025? Wish list for a Trump presidency, explained\nProject 2025 is a product of the Heritage Foundation, one of Washington's most prominent right-wing think tanks. It first produced policy plans for future Republican administrations in 1981, when Ronald Reagan was about to take office.\n\nIt has produced similar documents in connection with subsequent presidential elections, including in 2016, when Trump first won the presidency.\n\nThat's not unusual - it's common for US think tanks of all political stripes to propose policy wish lists for future governments.\n\nAnd Heritage has been successful in influencing Republican administrations. A year into Trump's first term, it boasted that the White House had adopted nearly two-thirds of its proposals.\n\nThe Project 2025 report was unveiled in April 2023, but it went largely unnoticed outside of policy circles until earlier this year, when Democratic opposition to the document ramped up.\n\nDemocratic politicians launched a \"Stop Project 2025 Task Force\" and even set up a tip line to collect insider information on Heritage's activities, claiming there is a \"secret\" part of the agenda pushing a list of executive orders that Trump could implement.\n\nThe Harris campaign and its surrogates consistently brought up the project in interviews and speeches.\n\nTrump began pushing away from the document in early July.\n\n\"I know nothing about Project 2025,\" he posted on his social media platform, Truth Social. \"I have no idea who is behind it.\n\n\"I disagree with some of the things they're saying and some of the things they\u2019re saying are absolutely ridiculous and abysmal.\"\n\nBut the team that created the project was chock-full of former Trump advisers, including director Paul Dans, who was chief of staff at the Office of Personnel Management while Trump was president. Dans later left the project.\n\nRussell Vought, another former Trump administration official, wrote a key chapter in the document and also served as the Republican National Committee\u2019s 2024 platform policy director.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation's president, Kevin Roberts, oversaw Project 2025 and is close to the vice-president elect, JD Vance, who wrote a forward for his new book Dawn\u2019s Early Light. The book's publication was originally scheduled for September but was delayed until after the election.\n\nAdditionally, more than 100 conservative organisations contributed to the document, Heritage says, including many that will now be hugely influential in Washington.\n\nThe document itself, external sets out four main policy aims: restore the family as the centrepiece of American life; dismantle the administrative state; defend the nation's sovereignty and borders; and secure God-given individual rights to live freely.",

        "text": "Trump promises 'unity' in first Capitol visit since Jan 6 riot\nTrump visits Capitol Hill for first time since Jan 6 riot\n\nDonald Trump has returned to Capitol Hill to meet Republicans in his first visit since the riot by supporters of his at Congress three years ago.\n\nThe presumptive Republican nominee in November's presidential election delivered a message of unity, promising to \"work out\" any lingering differences within the party.\n\nLater in the day, the former president met with an association of 200 corporate leaders.\n\nNancy Pelosi, the former Democratic House Speaker, said in a statement that Trump was the \"instigator of an insurrection... returning to the scene of the crime\".\n\nThe visit comes a fortnight after Trump's criminal conviction for falsifying business records in his hush-money trial in New York.\n\nHe arrived at a Republican office building near the US Capitol building on Thursday morning, passing a small crowd of protesters holding signs with slogans including \"failed coup\" and \"Democracy Forever, Trump Never\".\n\nIn a brief news conference early on Thursday afternoon, Trump said there was \"great unity\" in the party, and vowed to stand by fellow Republicans, even those he disagreed with.\n\n\"I'm with every one of you. I'll be with you always,\" he said. \"If [a relationship] wasn't fantastic, it gets worked out.\n\n\"We have one thing in mind, and that's making our county great again.\"\n\nTrump did not take questions, but waved and gave a thumbs up at a small group of supporters shouting \"I love you\".\n\n\"Thank you,\" he mouthed in response.\n\nFollowing a meeting between Trump and House Republicans earlier in the day, House Speaker Mike Johnson said the former president \"brought an extraordinary amount of energy and enthusiasm this morning\".\n\n\"That is what we're seeing in the party throughout the country,\" Mr Johnson said. \"We believe we are going to win back the White House, and the Senate, and grow the House majority.\"\n\nMatt Gaetz, a Florida Republican, described Trump's meeting with House Republicans as a \"pep-rally environment\" for the former president.\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican, told reporters she saw nothing but \"overwhelming support for Trump\" among the party rank-and-file.\n\n\"I am glad to see Republicans here in Washington rallying around President Trump and his candidacy as president,\" she said.\n\nSenate minority leader Mitch McConnell, who has been openly critical of Trump in the past, called the visit \"really positive\".\n\n\"He got a lot of standing ovations,\" Mr McConnell added.\n\nIn addition to Mr McConnell, two other Trump critics within the party - Utah Senator Mitt Romney and Louisiana's Bill Cassidy - were at the meeting.\n\nSenator Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, described Trump as \"extremely gracious\" and \"warm\" to Senate Republicans.\n\n\"I guess I've just been here five years, and that's probably the warmest meeting that I have been in with senators and Trump,\" he told reporters.\n\nMr Hawley said that Trump spoke about abortion \"quite a lot\" at the meeting, where he reiterated his stance that voters should be the ones to decide on the issue.",

        "text": "RFK Jr. offers foreign policy views on Ukraine, Israel, vows to halve military spending\nIndependent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. vowed Wednesday that if elected president, he'd slash the military budget by half.\n\n\"I will push for [a] 50% reduction in military expenditures in my first four years in office, with more cuts to come thereafter,\" Kennedy said. \"A way to keep the dollar strong is to keep the country strong. We can do that by redirecting our bloated military budget toward infrastructure, education and health and building our economy and building small business\"\n\nSpeaking the day before President Biden signed a security agreement with Ukraine, Kennedy told voters in Yorba Linda, Calif., that U.S. foreign policy has been based on the \"delusion\" that American intervention abroad will uphold democracy.\n\nCiting billion-dollar aid packages that have been approved for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan, Kennedy said he wants to roll back defense spending to the levels last seen under President Eisenhower. Seizing on the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953, Eisenhower believed he had an opening to avert an arms war with Russia and thought dramatically cutting defense spending would aid the cause. He did avoid major conflicts, but the Cold War still intensified during his presidency.\n\nKennedy also faulted the U.S. for \u2014 in his view \u2014 escalating conflict abroad over the past few decades. He has previously said he does not support more military aid for Ukraine, though he stands by Israel, calling the Russia-Ukraine conflict a \"war of choice\" and the Israel-Hamas conflict a \"moral war.\"\n\n\"We created ISIS,\" Kennedy told voters Wednesday night, referring to the brutal terrorist group that grew out of the remnants of al Qaeda in Iraq and spread across the Middle East in 2014. \"We drove four million immigrants up into Europe and destabilized all the Western democracies of Europe for generations.\"\n\nKennedy suggested that the U.S. take a page out of China's book. He said the country has emerged as a world superpower by using its budget more effectively, investing in infrastructure and businesses in places like Africa and South America, rather than beefing up its military presence.\n\n\"They spent $8 trillion on bridges, roads, airports and schools and hospitals,\" Kennedy said. \"Our forever wars made us enemies across the globe \u2014 left us bankrupt at home. China's investments, in contrast, made friends across the globe and brought it influence in every corner of the Earth.\"\n\nWhere does Kennedy stand on Ukraine?\n\nKennedy has rejected any U.S. involvement in Ukraine, including sending military aid, and told reporters at a campaign rally on Long Island in late April that he blames Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for issuing a decree making it \"illegal in Ukraine to negotiate with President Putin.\"\n\n\"[Putin] does not know what dignity and honesty are. Therefore, we are ready for a dialogue with Russia, but with another president of Russia,\" Zelenskyy said in October 2022, after Putin annexed four Ukrainian territories, which world leaders condemned as an illegal land grab.\n\nIn an interview with Twins Pod in early April, Kennedy seemed to praise the Russian leader for what in his view were the Russian leader's pacifist intentions, \"Putin said, 'Look I don't want to go into Crimea. Let's negotiate a peace.'\"\n\nTwo years ago, Putin undertook an invasion of Ukraine to keep it from making common cause with western democracies, thereby posing a threat to his rule in Russia.\n\nKennedy has also repeated the Russian president's claims that he undertook the invasion to keep NATO out of Ukraine and \"de-Nazify\" the country.\n\nMr. Biden has likened Putin's invasion of Ukraine to Hitler's Nazi forces invading other European nations. On Thursday, the leaders of the Group of Seven nations agreed to provide Ukraine with a $50 billion loan amid the ongoing war.\n\nWhere does Kennedy stand on Israel?\n\nKennedy has been a staunch supporter of Israel, often telling reporters that he believes Israel has the right to defend itself against Hamas following the massacre that took place on Oct. 7, 2023. Though the U.S. and western powers have called for restraint from Israel when attacking the Gaza Strip, Kennedy told Reuters that a cease-fire would only allow Hamas to rearm.\n\nKennedy's running mate, Nicole Shanahan, said she disagrees with the independent candidate on this front. Israel's response to Hamas' attack is a topic that leads to \"heated debate\" between the two, Shanahan said during a podcast last week with host Glenn Greenwald.\n\n\"And what I see right now happening on the ground in Gaza, is devastating. I think that, you know, there's arguments to be made, that we're long past the point of a cease-fire,\" Shanahan said. \"I think there's lots of arguments to be made that Israel should be showing more restraint.\"",

        "text": "What are the investment implications of MORENA\u2019s landslide victory in the 2024 Mexican elections?\nIt is still unclear how closely Sheinbaum will follow in Lopez Obrador\u2019s footsteps. While some political analysts view Sheinbaum as a technocrat, she is also part of a left-leaning party with strong ideologies and aims to centralize power.\n\nMORENA party\u2019s candidate, Claudia Sheinbaum, won the Mexican presidential election with a historic margin, receiving 60% of votes. This victory was anticipated, but the scale of left-leaning MORENA's win in Congress was unexpected. The ruling party and its allies achieved a qualified majority in the Chamber of Deputies but not the Senate, falling just short of the two-thirds majority needed in both houses to allow them to enact constitutional changes without opposition support.\n\nWhile policy continuity is still expected, this landslide victory by Morena could lead to increased policy and reform risks at a time when Mexico is currently a focal point for \u201cnearshoring\u201d \u2014a trend that has positioned Mexico as a strategic manufacturing hub for companies diversifying their supply chains. The wider-than-expected margin could make it easier for MORENA to implement more aggressive spending plans and pursue outgoing President Andr\u00e9s Manuel Lopez Obrador (AMLO)\u2019s 20-point reform agenda presented in February 2024, which includes increasing access to education and healthcare, increasing minimum wages and potentially reversing the previous pension system reform. Some market participants are also concerned that a potential reform of the Judicial system could weaken the institution\u2019s independence and judicial power. Sheinbaum has highlighted this will be one of her administration\u2019s first priorities.\n\nIt is still unclear how closely Sheinbaum will follow in Lopez Obrador\u2019s footsteps. While some political analysts view Sheinbaum as a technocrat, she is also part of a left-leaning party with strong ideologies and aims to centralize power. At the same time, she faces significant external pressure to keep the fiscal balance in check, boost trade and investment, and reduce violence.\n\nLooking ahead, U.S. investors should monitor several key challenges ahead for the new administration in Mexico. The upcoming review of the USMCA in the second half of 2026 will be crucial for understanding the future of trade relations and regulatory frameworks affecting multinational companies in Mexico. Additionally, the ability of Sheinbaum\u2019s administration to enhance infrastructure and strengthen the rule of law will be critical for attracting firms looking to relocate production to Mexico. Moreover, the rhetoric of U.S. candidates in the upcoming U.S. election, especially regarding potential tariffs and migration policies, could impact bilateral relations and economic policies, influencing the investment climate in Mexico.\n\nThe immediate market reaction to the election results was negative, with the Mexican peso depreciating over 4% the day following the quick vote release. Despite the MXN being one of the strongest performing major currencies again this year, supported by high real interest rates and robust inflows from remittances and tourism, the election outcome introduces new uncertainties that could lead to further volatility. In the short-term, jitters in Mexican equities and bonds could persist as investors continue to digest the potential for non-market friendly reforms, especially given that Mexican assets had become a consensus overweight. Longer term, \u201cnearshoring\u201d is a key tailwind for Mexico\u2019s economy and markets, but exactly how much it captures of this potential remains to be seen.",

        "text": "US declines to charge Merrick Garland for contempt of Congress\nUS declines to charge Merrick Garland for contempt\n\nThe US Department of Justice (DoJ) has declined to press charges against Attorney General Merrick Garland for contempt of Congress after the House of Representatives narrowly voted to punish him for his refusal to hand over audio tapes from an investigation into President Joe Biden.\n\nThe Republican-controlled House voted 216-207 on Wednesday to recommend that the DoJ, the department that Mr Garland oversees, file criminal charges against America's top law enforcement officer.\n\nThe move stems from Mr Garland's refusal to turn over to Republican lawmakers recorded interviews from a justice department probe of Mr Biden's handling of classified documents.\n\nIn a letter sent to Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson on Friday, a top DoJ official said the department found that Mr Garland's actions \"do not constitute a crime\". Mr Johnson called the move \"sadly predictable\".\n\nCarlos Felipe Uriarte, an assistant attorney general, said it was a \"longstanding position\" of the department not to bring charges in cases where the president has made the decision to conceal the requested material using his power of executive privilege.\n\nExecutive privilege is legal doctrine that grants presidents the right to withhold executive branch information from the other two branches of US government.\n\n\"Accordingly the Department will not bring the congressional contempt citation before a grand jury or take any other action to prosecute the Attorney General,\" Mr Uriarte wrote.\n\nThe House Speaker said he would go to federal court to force the attorney general to hand over the audio.\n\nMr Johnson called the DoJ decision \u201canother example of the two-tiered system of justice brought to us by the Biden Administration\u201d.\n\nHe cited the case of two ex-Trump aides, Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro, who tried to cite executive privilege in flouting congressional subpoenas. They were found in contempt of Congress, criminally prosecuted and sentenced to prison terms.\n\nLast month, Mr Biden invoked executive privilege to block congressional Republicans from accessing tapes of his interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur, who was investigating his retention of classified documents after he served as vice-president.\n\nMr Biden turned in the documents once they had been discovered. The DoJ special counsel who interviewed the Democratic US president said that although he had retained the files, he should not be charged as jurors would probably view him as a \"well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory\".\n\nThe White House said that Republicans had no legitimate need to access the five hours of audio, since a transcript had already been released. They argued that Republicans wanted to use the audio for campaign attack ads against Mr Biden as he seeks his second term as president this November.\n\nAs the oldest US president, 81-year-old Mr Biden's age is seen by opponents as a key political vulnerability. His Republican challenger, Donald Trump, just turned 78.\n\nTrump is facing a federal prosecution on charges of having retained documents that were meant to be handed over to government archivists after he left office.\n\nHe allegedly attempted to obstruct justice by hiding the classified memos after he had been ordered to submit them.\n\nTwo other attorneys general have been held in contempt of Congress in recent years.\n\nIn both cases Eric Holder, a Democrat, and Bill Barr, a Republican, received similar letters from the DoJ stating that prosecutors were declining to press charges.",

        "text": "Claudia De la Cruz\nAmerican community organizer and activist\n\nClaudia De la Cruz (born 1980/1981)[1] is a far-left[2] American community organizer and activist. She was the Party for Socialism and Liberation nominee for President of the United States in the 2024 election.[3]\n\nEarly life and education [ edit ]\n\nDe la Cruz was born in the South Bronx to immigrants from the Dominican Republic.[1][3][4] She attended Theodore Roosevelt High School, graduating in 1997.[1] A visit to Cuba at the age of 17 inspired her opposition to imperialism.[5]\n\nIn 2001, De la Cruz earned a bachelor's degree in forensic psychology from the John Jay College of Criminal Justice.[1] In 2007, she earned a master's degree in social work from Columbia University, and a master's degree in divinity from Union Theological Seminary.[1]\n\nCareer and activism [ edit ]\n\nAt the City University of New York, De la Cruz coordinated a teen group to study resistance movements and march against the 2003 Iraq War.[1][5] In 2004, she founded Da Urban Butterflies (DUB), a Washington Heights-based leadership group for teens and young women of Dominican and Puerto Rican descent. The \"Butterflies\" name honored the three Dominican Mirabal sisters who were killed in November 1960 for opposing the dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo.[1]\n\nDe la Cruz attended and later served as pastor of Santo Romero de Las Am\u00e9ricas church, a UCC congregation in New York City.[1][6] She saw that church as important to her \"social and political formation\"; she \"wanted to do community organizing from a faith-based perspective\".[1]\n\nDe la Cruz served as co-executive director of The People's Forum, an activist organization in New York City which she co-founded.[4][5][7][8] With the People's Forum, she has participated in numerous pro-Palestinian protests, including a \"Shut Down Wall Street\" event during the 2023 Israel\u2013Hamas war.[3][7][9][10]\n\n2024 presidential campaign [ edit ]\n\nLogo for the 2024 presidential campaign for the Party for Socialism and Liberation\n\nDe la Cruz announced her presidential campaign on September 7, 2023. She and running mate Karina Garcia are the presidential ticket for the Party for Socialism and Liberation (PSL), a Marxist\u2013Leninist party, in the 2024 U.S. presidential election.[3][5] Their socialist policy program includes a pledge to support reparations for Black Americans, institute a single-payer healthcare system, end all U.S. aid to Israel, forgive all student loan debt, fully recognize Native American sovereignty and honor treaty rights, cut the U.S. military budget by 90%, seize the 100 largest corporations, expand public transportation, and use taxation to eliminate billionaires.[11]\n\nOn January 28, 2024, Claudia De la Cruz and Karina Garcia held their first in-person campaign event in Newark, New Jersey.[12] On February 29, 2024, De la Cruz participated in a presidential candidates debate hosted by the Free & Equal Elections Foundation, alongside Green Party candidates Jill Stein and Jasmine Sherman, and Libertarian Party candidates Chase Oliver and Lars Mapstead.[13][14]\n\nIn March 2024, the South Carolina Workers Party voted to place De la Cruz and Garcia on the state ballot for president and vice president.[15] In June 2024, De la Cruz gave a speech at a pro-Palestine protest that surrounded the White House.[16]\n\nFor the 2024 election, Democrats worked to keep De la Cruz and other third-party candidates such as Cornel West off of ballots,[17] while Republicans intervened to keep third-party candidates on ballots.\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "United States\nA year of sweeping job losses that some compare to the 2008 financial crisis has left US newsrooms hoping that heightened attention in a presidential election year will staunch the industry-wide bleeding. Meanwhile, publishers have been wrestling with how generative AI could help drive greater efficiency in the newsroom without damaging trust. New roles are being created to manage this process.\n\nThe US news industry shed jobs at a precipitous rate over the last year, with total losses of nearly 2,700 positions in 2023 \u2013 the grimmest year since the pandemic \u2013 followed by a wave of high-profile layoffs in early 2024. The cuts have hit iconic brands across the industry, from broadcast giants NBC News and ABC News, to Time Magazine and National Geographic, to major NPR affiliates like New England Public Radio, New York Public Radio, and Southern California Public Radio.\n\nNewspapers continue to be hit the hardest. The Los Angeles Times laid off 115 journalists to begin 2024, more than one-fifth of its newsroom. That followed a year in which the Washington Post cut more than 250 positions through a combination of layoffs and buyouts. Many regional papers, like the Dallas Morning News and the San Diego Union Tribune, saw major newsroom cuts in 2023.\n\nAmong digital-first venues, the non-profit Texas Tribune announced its first-ever layoffs in August, losing 10% of its newsroom. Vox Media and Vice Media both saw two waves of staff cuts in 2023; the latter then laid off \u2018hundreds\u2019 more in February 2024 and announced it would shutter its news site, vice.com. Business Insider, owned by Axel Springer, likewise announced an 8% staff cut to begin the new year. The revered music journalism site Pitchfork, launched in 1996, was restructured by parent Cond\u00e9 Nast and folded into GQ magazine.\n\nMeanwhile, a report from the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University found 2.5 local newspapers closed every week in 2023; that leaves more than half of all counties in the US with \u2018limited access to reliable news and information\u2019, the authors found. According to the report, by the end of 2024, the US will have lost a third of its newspapers since 2005.1\n\nTo help mitigate these trends, a coalition of 22 national funders and donors launched Press Forward in 2023. The national initiative will invest more than $500m over five years to strengthen local newsrooms, address inequalities facing underserved communities and news-desert areas, and support policies focused on access to news and information, among other goals. Public officials at the state and national levels have also introduced bills focused on supporting and sustaining local news outlets and journalists.\n\nGenerative AI is becoming an important tool for newsrooms. Some news organisations drew negative attention for their AI use, including Sports Illustrated, which published AI-generated articles accompanied with bylines and headshots of fake writers, according to reporting by Futurism. Earlier, the website CNET published more than 70 articles written using AI tools, some of which contained mistakes and were inadequately labelled.2\n\nThe New York Times has begun building a team to explore strategies for using AI in the newsroom, hiring Quartz co-founder Zach Seward as the editorial director of AI initiatives. A social media post from Seward referenced plans to hire a machine-learning engineer, a software engineer, a designer, and editors for the initiative. The Times also drew attention for its lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement. The suit alleges that the companies\u2019 chatbots were trained with millions of articles published by the Times \u2013 and now represent sources of competition.3\n\nThe challenges facing X (formerly Twitter) continue to mount, with a study from Edison Research finding that the platform experienced a 30% usage drop from 2023\u201324. More than a year after taking over as CEO, Elon Musk has eliminated the platform\u2019s blue-check verification system and outsourced content moderators, and many staff members have been fired, laid off, or have exited, including the head of Trust and Safety. In July, Musk tweeted that the company had seen a 50% drop in advertising revenue. In July, Facebook launched Threads, a text-based version of Instagram that drew 10 million users in its first seven hours and surpassed 100 million within days but has struggled to maintain that early momentum.\n\nCable news outlets have seen major shakeups over the past year, including the September retirement of Rupert Murdoch from the Fox and News Corp boards and the appointment of his son Lachlan to run the global media empire. New CNN chief executive Mark Thompson announced in early 2024 that the network would overhaul its morning programming, including transitioning flagship show CNN This Morning from a chat-show format to straight news coverage, amid viewership declines.\n\nJoy Jenkins and Lucas Graves\n\nUniversity of Missouri/University of Wisconsin-Madison",

        "text": "The Economist\u2019s US presidential forecast gives Joe Biden a 34% chance of staving off a second Trump term\nToday The Economist launched its statistical forecast model for the 2024 US presidential election, which, at the moment, gives Joe Biden a 34% chance of holding on to the presidency.\n\nMr Biden trails in polling averages in all six plausibly decisive states, with deficits ranging from one to six percentage points. In the two where he is closest, Wisconsin and Michigan, Democratic candidates\u2019 margins have under-performed the final polls by an average of six percentage points during the past two elections. And even if he wins both, he would still need one more swing state to secure the 270 electoral votes necessary for re-election.\n\n\u201cOur 2024 forecast deploys rigorous statistical methods, but ultimately reflects the data that go into it. Donald Trump leads polls nationally and in every swing state. Unless and until that changes, the model will make Trump at least a narrow favorite,\u201d said Dan Rosenheck, data editor.\n\nAs of June 12th, The Economist forecast model suggests:\n\nBiden is slightly more likely to gain ground on Trump during the next five months than to lose it\n\nOn average, the model predicts Biden to pick up half a percentage point nationwide, yielding a tie in the popular vote\n\nBiden has a 24% chance of holding on to Georgia, where his lost popularity with black voters is most damaging, and a 31% and 36% chance in Arizona and Nevada, respectively\n\nRead Dan Rosenheck\u2019s\u2019 analysis of The Economist\u2019s forecast model here: https://www.economist.com/US-forecast-analysis\n\nTo interview an editor or to find out more about the forecast, please contact: Tom Amos [email protected]\n\nAbout The Economist\n\nWith rigorous reporting, in-depth analysis and global perspective, The Economist explains today\u2019s most important events and seeks to discern the trends that will shape the future. In addition to the weekly print edition, The Economist publishes its journalism daily through its website, app, podcasts, newsletters, videos and Espresso, an app for concise global news. The Economist has 1.2m subscribers. More than 60m people follow The Economist across X (formerly Twitter), Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, LinkedIn, TikTok and Threads.\n\nAbout the forecast model\n\nThe model is updated every day and combines state and national polls with economic indicators to predict the election results across the country. To work out the likely electoral-vote totals, we run over 10,000 simulations of the election.",

Bitcoin regained some ground on Wednesday before tumbling again on Friday. While other risk assets such as stocks bounced back on cooler-than-expected inflation data, bitcoin failed to claw back the losses.\n\nDespite bitcoin's performance last week, crypto is having a moment on the U.S. presidential election campaign trail. Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump met with bitcoin miners last week and a leaked email showed members of President Joe Biden's adminstration will meet with members of the crypto community.\n\nElsewhere, Terraform Labs has agreed to a massive $4.5 billion settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding the TerraUSD stablecoin disaster from 2022, and an investigative report concluded that Binance founder and former CEO Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao is one of the top 25 richest people in the world.\n\nCrypto Growing as a U.S. Presidential Election Issue\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has shifted his stance on cryptocurrencies during the current election cycle, now actively courting the crypto community to gain an edge over rivals Joe Biden and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nAfter meeting with bitcoin miners at his Mar-a-Lago estate, Trump urged cryptocurrency enthusiasts on his Truth Social platform to \"vote for Trump,\" positioning himself as a defender against what he calls \"Biden's hatred of Bitcoin.\"\n\n\n\nThis new approach follows Trump's previous strong criticism of cryptocurrencies during his presidency, where he labeled them as highly volatile and unregulated assets that facilitate illegal activities. Now, however, Trump's campaign has announced plans to accept cryptocurrency donations, aiming to mobilize a \"crypto army\" to secure his election victory.\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, the Biden Administration's approach to Bitcoin and crypto has come under fire, especially with a recent veto on legislation supporting crypto custody by financial institutions and proposed taxes on Bitcoin mining. According to a report in The Block, Biden is also expected to start accepting campaign contributions via crypto.\n\nPeople in Biden's camp will reportedly be attending a Bitcoin and blockchain roundtable next month, according to Bitcoin Magazine.\n\nTerraform Labs Agrees to $4.5 Billion SEC Settlement\n\nLast Wednesday, a court filing revealed that Terraform Labs consented to a nearly $4.5 billion settlement to resolve a lawsuit from the SEC. The filing requested court approval for the settlement, which would put an end to a legal battle over the company's role in the dramatic failure of TerraUSD in May 2022 that led to an estimated $40 billion loss for investors.\n\n\n\nThe settlement comprises roughly $3.5 billion in disgorgement, over $460 million in prejudgment interest, and $420 million as a civil penalty. Former CEO Do Kwon will also personally contribute over $200 million to the Terraform bankruptcy estate and is barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.\n\nThis agreement, originally reached ahead of a May 29 hearing, aims to impose substantial financial remedies and facilitate swift recovery for investors. The SEC highlighted that these penalties are intended to deter future fraudulent activities in the cryptocurrency market. Terraform Labs declared bankruptcy earlier this year, just before its trial with the SEC, where it was found guilty of defrauding investors.\n\nBinance Founder Changpeng Zhao Estimated to Be 24th Richest Person in the World\n\nSince his imprisonment, Binance founder Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao has seen a significant increase in his net worth.\n\nForbes now estimates Zhao\u2019s fortune is $61 billion, making him the world's 24th richest person.\n\nThis rise comes from his 90% stake in Binance, valued at $33 billion. Zhao stepped down as CEO of the company in November 2023 as a result of a plea deal with the U.S. Department of Justice. Despite the company's legal challenges and a $4.3 billion fine, Zhao's personal financial impact was limited to a $50 million fine. Since then, Binance has continued to grow, with its market share rising to 42% from 38% before Zhao's departure.\n\n\n\nA major boost to Zhao\u2019s wealth comes from his holdings in Binance Coin (BNB). Forbes estimates he owns around 94 million tokens, which is 64% of all BNB tokens. Despite Binance\u2019s legal troubles, BNB has surged by 100% in 2024, reaching a market cap of $110 billion.\n\nBinance\u2019s initial coin offering in 2017 was undersubscribed, and forensic analysis indicates Zhao and Binance retained a significant portion of the unsold tokens. Currently, BNB trades heavily on Binance\u2019s platform, and the token's performance has continued to add billions to Zhao\u2019s net worth, even as he serves his sentence.\n\nWhat to Expect in the Markets This Week\n\nAll eyes are on the bitcoin price this week, as digital asset investment products, which include U.S.-based bitcoin ETFs, experienced more than $600 million in outflows amidst bitcoin's price drop last week, according to CoinShares.\n\nDespite the price drop, the notorious bitcoin bulls at MicroStrategy (MSTR) announced another $500 million convertible note offering for the purpose of purchasing more bitcoin before updating the offering to $700 million later in the week.\n\nWhile bitcoin has traded in a relatively narrow range this month, the crypto asset has been outperformed by several bitcoin mining stocks, as noted by a JPMorgan report. This is thought to be a response to Core Scientific's (CORZ) deal with CoreWeave related to artificial intelligence.\n\nThe SEC's approval of spot ether ETFs also now appears to be an issue of \"when\" rather than \"if.\" SEC Chair Gary Gensler indicated in a Senate hearing last week that the matter will be resolved over the summer. Additionally, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas gives a 50-50 chance that the approval will take place by July 2. Prediction market Polymarket puts chances of a spot ether ETF trading by July 4 at 75%.",

        "text": "Biden preparing to offer legal status to undocumented immigrants who have lived in U.S. for 10 years\nThe Biden administration is making plans to announce one of the largest immigration relief programs in recent history, developing a policy that would offer legal status to hundreds of thousands of immigrants living in the country without proper documents, four people familiar with the plans told CBS News.\n\nA program being developed by White House officials would offer work permits and deportation protections to unauthorized immigrants married to U.S. citizens, as long as they have lived in the U.S. for at least 10 years, the sources said, requesting anonymity to talk about internal government plans.\n\nThe proposal, known as \"Parole in Place,\" would also open up a pathway to permanent legal status and U.S. citizenship for some beneficiaries by removing an obstacle in U.S. law that prevents those who entered the U.S. illegally from obtaining green cards without leaving the country.\n\nAnother plan being prepared by the Biden administration would streamline the process for so-called DREAMers and other undocumented immigrants to request waivers that would make it easier for them to obtain temporary visas, such as H-1B visas for high-skilled workers, the sources said.\n\nThe proposal is set to be announced Tuesday, according to sources briefed on the White House's plans, when administration officials are preparing to host an event to celebrate the 12th anniversary of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which shields roughly 530,000 undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children from deportation.\n\nSome Democratic lawmakers have already been invited to Tuesday's immigration event at the White House, three congressional officials told CBS News, requesting anonymity to share private invitations.\n\nA White House official said no final decisions had been made. White House spokesperson Angelo Fernandez Hernandez previously said the administration is \"committed to taking action to address our broken immigration system.\"\n\nThe \"Parole in Place\" plan would be the largest immigration program for unauthorized immigrants since DACA, a policy that former President Barack Obama announced in 2012 as a \"stopgap\" measure to protect DREAMers in light of congressional inaction on immigration.\n\nThe policy would benefit a subset of the estimated 1.1 million unauthorized immigrants with American citizen spouses, as long as they meet the residency requirement and other rules. Overall, there are approximately 11 million immigrants living in the U.S. unlawfully, according to the most recent government estimate.\n\nThe move would further underscore an increased willingness by President Biden to take executive actions on immigration ahead of the presidential election in November. Just last week, Mr. Biden invoked his executive authority to enact a partial ban on asylum claims at the southern border, a move that has already been challenged in federal court by the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nJust like the border executive action, the \"Parole in Place\" program will likely face legal challenges, possibly from Republican-led states, which have filed multiple lawsuits against Mr. Biden's more generous immigration policies.\n\nThe program would almost certainly garner vocal opposition from Republican lawmakers, who have increasingly taken strong stances against \"amnesty\" for those living in the U.S. illegally.\n\n\"Biden's border is still in crisis and his latest idea is amnesty. This will invite more chaos,\" said Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma, the lead Republican negotiator of a border security deal brokered by the White House and a group of senators earlier this year.\n\nStill, Mr. Biden has been arguing that he's acting unilaterally on immigration because Congress failed to pass that agreement, which was rejected by most Republican lawmakers. Political analysts also believe the \"Parole in Place\" policy could help Mr. Biden's chances of earning more support from Latino voters, especially those in mixed-status families that would benefit from the move.\n\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the federal agency that oversees the legal immigration system, has administered a more limited \"Parole in Place\" program for military families for over a decade. The policy allows some undocumented immigrants who are immediate relatives of U.S. service members or veterans to obtain green cards, without having to leave the country.",

        "text": "Trump allies working to flip Arab American votes in Michigan\nOne of Donald Trump's emissaries to Arab Americans is a Lebanese-born businessman who moved to Texas as a teenager, speaks Arabic, English and French, and recently joined the Trump family when his son married the former president's younger daughter.\n\nTrump made his first appearance in Michigan on Saturday since his \"hush money\" conviction. Trump hosted a roundtable at an African American church in Detroit before speaking at Turning Point Action's \"People's Convention.\"\n\nMassad Boulos has taken on the challenge of trying to convince a politically influential community angry at President Joe Biden that Trump is a better option. But many Arab Americans also note Trump has positioned himself as more pro-Israel than Mr. Biden and has made a series of comments and policy announcements that critics blast as Islamophobic.\n\nTrump has long put family members and their relatives in key roles in his campaigns and the White House. Boulos, whose son Michael married Tiffany Trump two years ago, is the latest relative to rise in Trump's political orbit as he uses long-standing connections in an effort to build support for the presumptive Republican nominee's 2024 campaign.\n\nSome Trump allies think they can capitalize on dissension within Mr. Biden's Democratic base over his support for the Israeli offensive in Gaza, where more than 37,000 people have died since Hamas' Oct. 7, according to health officials in the Hamas-run territory who do not give the breakdown of civilians and fighters. Mr. Biden faced a significant protest vote during the Michigan primary in February in areas with high numbers of Arab Americans, who are an important Democratic bloc.\n\n\"Obviously the No. 1 point that is of high priority within the Arab American community is the current war in the Middle East,\" Boulos said in an interview. \"And the question is, who can bring peace and who is bringing war? And they know the answer to that.\"\n\nSeveral of the people who have met with Boulos also point to Trump's statements about Arabs and Muslims. While president, Trump banned immigration from several majority-Muslim countries and questioned the loyalty of Muslim lawmakers serving in Congress. Now, as he campaigns for a second term after losing in 2020, Trump has at times criticized Mr. Biden for being insufficiently supportive of Israel and has threatened to deport pro-Palestinian protesters he labels as supporters of Hamas.\n\n\"I told Massad, 'This isn't about you being Lebanese and me being Lebanese,'\" said Osama Siblani, a publisher of the Arab American News in Dearborn. \"You can't just buy votes. You have to give something substantial to the community. And Trump hasn't done that yet.\"\n\nBoulos, who is of medium stature with graying black hair, square glasses, and a warm, friendly smile, is often complimented for his calm demeanor and humility \u2014 qualities not always associated with someone overseeing a billion-dollar conglomerate.\n\nBorn in Lebanon, Boulos moved to Texas shortly before attending the University of Houston and obtaining a doctor of jurisprudence degree. Boulos said he actively participated in Republican politics as a student.\n\nAfter graduating, he eventually joined his family's business of three generations and became the managing director and CEO of the conglomerate SCOA Nigeria, which specializes in the assembly and distribution of motor vehicles and equipment.\n\nBoulos has a background in politics in his home country, having run unsuccessfully for a parliamentary seat in Lebanon in 2009. He describes himself as a \"friend\" of Sleiman Frangieh, a Christian politician allied with the Shiite party and the militant group Hezbollah. Frangieh is currently Hezbollah's endorsed candidate for Lebanon's presidential vacancy.\n\nA supporter of Trump from afar since his first campaign, Boulos became more directly involved after meeting Trump at a White House Christmas party in 2019. At the time, Michael Boulos was dating Tiffany Trump.\n\nMassad Boulos has given no recent donations, according to campaign finance records. But in a trip to Michigan this month, he attended what he described as a \"private fundraising event\" with U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., U.S. Rep. Lisa McClain, R-Mich., and about 50 Arab Americans.\n\nBoulos assisted with the 2020 campaign, but his role has significantly expanded since his son married Tiffany Trump in 2022, especially as Arab American dissatisfaction with Mr. Biden presented what Trump allies think is a larger political opportunity.\n\n\"One less vote for Biden is a vote for Trump,\" said Bishara Bahbah, chairman of the group Arab Americans for Trump.\n\nBoulos maintains a \"very close working relationship\" with the group, Bahbah said.\n\nThe group, which says it is independent of the Trump campaign, has established operations in Michigan and Arizona, states identified as priority areas by \"people close to Trump,\" Bahbah said.\n\nA May meeting held in Troy, Michigan, included Massad and Michael Boulos as well as Richard Grenell, who was Trump's ambassador to Germany and is a key foreign policy adviser to the former president. Approximately 40 Arab American activists from across the country attended.\n\nWhile Arab Americans for Trump was involved in the event, Boulos said that it had primarily been initiated by Grenell. The gathering received mixed feedback, with some attendees saying it lacked substance and failed to address their concerns regarding Trump.\n\n\"Grenell didn't say what they would do, but he kept reminding us that when Trump was president, there was no war whatsoever and that he launched the biggest peace effort in the Middle East. But most Arabs and Muslims don't consider the Abraham Accords a peace agreement,\" said Khaled Saffuri, an Arab American political activist who was in attendance.\n\nGrenell tried to call Trump to have him address attendees by phone, according to multiple people at the meeting. The former president did not answer.\n\nGrenell and the Trump campaign declined to comment.\n\nJust over a week later, Boulos returned for another round of engagements. This time, he had several meetings with nearly 50 members of the Arab American community, alongside one-on-one sessions with individuals identified as \"high-target\" leaders by Mike Hacham, the coordinator for Arab Americans for Trump in Michigan.\n\nBoulos said his efforts so far have been \"more of a personal effort to reconnect with friends.\" He said he typically begins meetings by speaking for close to 20 minutes, laying out the records of the Biden and Trump presidencies. He then opens the floor for any questions.\n\nSiblani had a nearly two-hour meeting with Boulos, who was accompanied by Bahbah, the chair of Arab Americans for Trump.\n\nAccording to Siblani, Boulos argued that things were better for Arab Americans under Trump and that the world saw less conflict and fewer wars during his presidency, suggesting Trump could help resolve the Gaza conflict.\n\nBut when Siblani pushed back, he said that Boulos lacked \"facts to prove his claim that Trump is better.\"\n\n\"Massad is unable to convince people to come to Trump's side because he hasn't offered anything substantial to the community, except that his son is married to Trump's daughter and he has access,\" Siblani said. \"That is fine, but what we need is policy and what Trump will do.\"\n\nIn interviews, Boulos said that Trump \"respects and admires\" the Arab American community. He denied the existence of a \"Muslim ban,\" which is how many Trump opponents refer to his ban on immigrants from several majority-Muslim countries. Boulos argued it was actually \"extreme vetting from certain parts of the world.\"\n\nThe key messages arising from these meetings, Boulos said, are communicated to Trump. Boulos highlighted a recent social media post from Trump that promised to bring \"peace in the Middle East\" if reelected, as evidence. Boulos asserted that the timing of the post \"wasn't a coincidence\" but rather a response to \"listening to the community's concerns.\"\n\nTrump's statement, posted on his social media platform, Truth Social, on June 4, did not go far enough for multiple community leaders who met with Boulos.\n\nIn a statement, Trump campaign spokesperson Brian Hughes said the campaign is \"grateful that supporters of President Trump are working to communicate with this community.\"\n\n\"We share the belief that Biden's failed Middle East policies have brought death, chaos and war to the region. That failure led tens of thousands of Democrats to vote 'uncommitted' in Michigan's Presidential primary. The Trump campaign has and will continue to communicate to those voters and remind them that President Trump's policies in the Middle East brought that region historic levels of peace and stability,\" Hughes said.\n\nSome in the community still feel that there are other options than just Trump and Mr. Biden. Green Party candidate Jill Stein visited Dearborn this year to meet with leaders and recently had conversations with the city's mayor, Abdullah Hammoud, about the possibility of him becoming her running mate.\n\nHammoud, at 34 years old, is ineligible to serve as vice president. The U.S. Constitution requires both the president and vice president to be at least 35.\n\nOfficials in Mr. Biden's administration have also visited Dearborn to meet with local leaders and have maintained ongoing contact with them, including Siblani.\n\nAmmar Moussa, a spokesperson for the Biden campaign, criticized Trump allies' outreach, saying in a statement that Trump \"is the biggest threat to the Muslim and Arab community.\"\n\n\"He and his allies believe we don't belong in this country and Trump is openly speaking about allowing Israel to bomb Gaza without regard,\" said Moussa, who is Arab American. \"Trump and his campaign are racists and Islamophobes. Period. President Biden, on the other hand, is working tirelessly towards a just and lasting peace.\"\n\nUntil the November election, Boulos said he will continue to divide his time between managing his company and meeting with the Arab American community.\n\nHe stressed that he is solely driven by being a \"concerned citizen and a Republican.\" He has not contemplated a role in Trump's administration if the Republican were to win.\n\n\"I honestly don't have any thoughts about that at this time. I didn't give this any thought whatsoever, but definitely I do not aspire for anything,\" he said.",

        "text": "Biden faces complex juggling act on immigration as election nears\nBiden is walking immigration tightrope - but he's under fire no matter what\n\nImmigration and the US-Mexico border are cited by many Americans are their primary electoral concern.\n\nUS President Joe Biden has vowed not to \"play politics\" with the southern border and immigration - a potentially tall order as the US hurtles toward the November presidential election.\n\nMr Biden's comments came on what he called a \"good day\" in which he announced an executive order aimed at protecting hundreds of thousands of undocumented spouses of US citizens from deportation and allowing them to work in the US.\n\nHis actions, however, have drawn criticism from Republicans and some fellow Democrats alike, forcing the president into a complex juggling act.\n\nPolls show that a majority of voters see immigration as one of the most important problems facing the country - a fact which makes Mr Biden's stated desire to be apolitical on the issue difficult.\n\nThe new executive action announced by the administration on Tuesday has been widely praised by immigration activists and Democrats alike, many of whom have lauded it as the most significant relief programme for undocumented migrants already in the US since the Obama administration announced the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or Daca, in 2012.\n\nThe chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC), California Democrat Nanette Barrag\u00e1n, praised the move as a \u201chappy day\u201d for immigrant families, who \u201ccan go to sleep tonight knowing their loved ones will not be going anywhere\u201d.\n\nBut the latest move stands in stark contrast to his sweeping immigration order issued in early June, which allows officials to quickly remove migrants entering the US illegally without processing their asylum requests.\n\nThe executive actions - spaced out over the span of just two weeks - have highlighted the complex tightrope that Mr Biden finds himself in with regards to the issue.\n\n\u201cBiden always finds himself in a hard place,\u201d Republican strategist Doug Heye told the BBC. \u201cWhatever he does is going to get criticism. This is a perfect example.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s underperforming with Hispanic voters, so he\u2019s trying to make a move to bring in a lot of votes. But it can cost him votes as well,\u201d he added. \u201cThat is, by definition, mixed messaging.\u201d\n\nThe asylum restrictions announced on 5 June, now the focus of a lawsuit from the American Civil Liberties Union, were widely criticised by immigration advocates and even some of Mr Biden\u2019s Democratic allies.\n\nIn a statement, the CHC called the order \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d and symptomatic of enforcement strategies that have \u201crepeatedly proven ineffective\u201d and created \u201cchaos\u201d at the border.\n\nSpokespeople for Donald Trump, Mr Biden's Republican challenger, condemned both actions as a move towards \u201camnesty\u201d for undocumented workers.",

        "text": "Catholics could decide the 2024 election\nThis combination image of two file photos shows then-President Donald Trump, left, and then-Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden during a presidential debate Sept. 29, 2020, at Case Western University and Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland. (RNS/AP/Patrick Semansky)\n\nWith the 2024 presidential election predicted to be very close, American Catholics could be the deciding voters in the election. Catholics are a significant voting bloc, almost evenly divided among Republicans and Democrats (though white Catholics tend to be Republican and Hispanic Catholics Democrats). Because they reside in significant numbers in battleground states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Nevada, they have all the more power to decide who will be the next president. All these demographic facts make Catholics a good weathervane, and indeed they tend to vote for the winner in presidential elections. If you win Catholics, you probably win the country. Catholics were once dependable members of the Democratic coalition. Beginning in 1928, they began voting Democratic when Protestant and Republican operatives smeared New York Gov. Al Smith, the first Catholic to run for president, with anti-Catholic propaganda. Catholics went on to support Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal, breaking ranks with the Democrats only to reelect Dwight Eisenhower to his second term in 1956. They reverted to form in 1960 and '64, voting for John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson, both Democrats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRichard Nixon was the first to recognize that Republicans had a chance of wooing Catholics to their party. By 1968, white Catholics had joined the middle class and moved to the suburbs. They were paying more taxes, and some objected to affirmative action and the integration of schools through busing. The bond with the Republicans was deepened by Ronald Reagan, who switched his stance on abortion to pro-life in an appeal to both Catholics and evangelical Christians in 1980. Today, Donald Trump appeals to the same nativist prejudices against immigrants that were directed at Catholics in the first half of the 20th century. That many white Catholics respond to this appeal shows how ignorant they are of what their grandparents and great-grandparents experienced. But many feel abandoned by the Democrats, especially working-class white Catholics in the Rust Belt who have suffered from factory closings. The Catholic bishops have tended to ally with the Republican Party, as they have made the abortion issue preeminent. Though Trump has changed his position on abortion numerous times, when it mattered most he appointed justices to the U.S. Supreme Court who overturned Roe v. Wade. But on issues such as health care, immigration, the environment and help for the poor, the bishops have been critical of Republican policies and supported Democratic programs.\n\nThis is reflected in their election-year document, \"Faithful Citizenship,\" which is strongly pro-life but also concerned for the poor. Sadly, it has not been updated to reflect Pope Francis' concern about global warming and the environment.",

        "text": "Biden faces complex juggling act on immigration as election nears\nUS President Joe Biden has vowed not to \"play politics\" with the southern border and immigration - a potentially tall order as the US hurtles toward the November presidential election.\n\nMr Biden's comments came on what he called a \"good day\" in which he announced an executive order aimed at protecting hundreds of thousands of undocumented spouses of US citizens from deportation and allowing them to work in the US.\n\nHis actions, however, have drawn criticism from Republicans and some fellow Democrats alike, forcing the president into a complex juggling act.\n\nPolls show that a majority of voters see immigration as one of the most important problems facing the country - a fact which makes Mr Biden's stated desire to be apolitical on the issue difficult.\n\nThe new executive action announced by the administration on Tuesday has been widely praised by immigration activists and Democrats alike, many of whom have lauded it as the most significant relief programme for undocumented migrants already in the US since the Obama administration announced the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or Daca, in 2012.\n\nThe chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC), California Democrat Nanette Barrag\u00e1n, praised the move as a \u201chappy day\u201d for immigrant families, who \u201ccan go to sleep tonight knowing their loved ones will not be going anywhere\u201d.\n\nBut the latest move stands in stark contrast to his sweeping immigration order issued in early June, which allows officials to quickly remove migrants entering the US illegally without processing their asylum requests.\n\nThe executive actions - spaced out over the span of just two weeks - have highlighted the complex tightrope that Mr Biden finds himself in with regards to the issue.\n\n\u201cBiden always finds himself in a hard place,\u201d Republican strategist Doug Heye told the BBC. \u201cWhatever he does is going to get criticism. This is a perfect example.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s underperforming with Hispanic voters, so he\u2019s trying to make a move to bring in a lot of votes. But it can cost him votes as well,\u201d he added. \u201cThat is, by definition, mixed messaging.\u201d\n\nThe asylum restrictions announced on 5 June, now the focus of a lawsuit from the American Civil Liberties Union, were widely criticised by immigration advocates and even some of Mr Biden\u2019s Democratic allies.\n\nIn a statement, the CHC called the order \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d and symptomatic of enforcement strategies that have \u201crepeatedly proven ineffective\u201d and created \u201cchaos\u201d at the border.\n\nSpokespeople for Donald Trump, Mr Biden's Republican challenger, condemned both actions as a move towards \u201camnesty\u201d for undocumented workers.",

        "text": "Biden immigration program offers legal status to 500,000 spouses of U.S. citizens. Here's how it works.\nWho would be eligible for citizenship in Biden's new immigration policy?\n\nPresident Biden on Tuesday announced a large-scale immigration program that will offer legal status and a streamlined path to U.S. residency and citizenship to roughly half a million unauthorized immigrants married to American citizens.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security policy will allow these immigrants to apply for work permits and deportation protections if they have lived in the U.S. for at least 10 years and meet other requirements, senior administration officials said previewing the announcement.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, however, Mr. Biden's move will unlock a path to permanent residency \u2014 colloquially known as a green card \u2014 and ultimately U.S. citizenship for many of the program's beneficiaries.\n\n\"For those wives or husbands and their children who have lived in America for a decade or more, but are undocumented, this action will allow them to file paperwork for legal status in the United States, allowing them to work while they remain with their families in the United States,\" Mr. Biden said.\n\nThe policy, if upheld in court, would be the largest government program for undocumented immigrants since the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals initiative, which currently shields 528,000 so-called \"Dreamers\" who were brought to the U.S. as children from deportation.\n\nMr. Biden announced the measure at a White House event on Tuesday marking the 12th anniversary of DACA, alongside another move to make it easier for employers to sponsor \"Dreamers\" and other undocumented immigrants for work visas.\n\nIt's the second time in one month that Mr. Biden has taken a sweeping \u2014 and legally risky \u2014 executive action on immigration. Earlier in June, he invoked a presidential power used frequently by former President Donald Trump to disqualify most migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border from asylum.\n\nHow Biden's immigration plan would work\n\nPresident Biden speaks in the East Room of the White House in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, June 18, 2024. Ting Shen/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nThe Biden administration program for undocumented immigrants married to U.S. citizens will provide two key immigration benefits.\n\nIt will allow eligible applicants to work and live in the U.S. legally on a temporary basis under the immigration parole authority. The policy, known as \"Parole in Place,\" will also help these immigrants clear roadblocks in U.S. law that prevent them from getting permanent legal status without having to leave the country.\n\nAn immigrant who marries a U.S. citizen is generally eligible for a green card. But current federal law requires immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally to leave the country and re-enter legally to be eligible for a green card. Leaving the U.S. after living illegally in the country for certain periods of time can trigger a 10-year ban, leading many mixed-status families to not pursue this process.\n\nThe Biden administration's policy would allow eligible immigrants to obtain a green card without having to leave the U.S. After 3 to 5 years of living in the U.S. as a green card holder, immigrants can apply for American citizenship.\n\nAdministration officials estimate that roughly 500,000 unauthorized immigrants with U.S. citizen spouses will qualify for the program. Applicants must have been legally married to their American citizen spouse by June 17. Those who are deemed to pose a threat to national security or public safety will not qualify.\n\nThe policy is also expected to benefit an estimated 50,000 immigrant children with a parent who is married to a U.S. citizen, officials said. Undocumented stepchildren of U.S. citizens \u2014 who must also leave the country to obtain green cards \u2014 will be eligible to apply for the parole process if they are under the age of 21.\n\nA senior administration official said the government is planning to open the Parole in Place program to applications \"by the end of summer.\" The policy will almost certainly generate legal challenges, possibly from Republican-led states, which have sued the Biden administration over its immigration policies several times.\n\nFor over a decade, the U.S. government has overseen a more limited Parole in Place policy for unauthorized immigrants who are the immediate relatives of U.S. service members or veterans. In 2020, Congress affirmed that policy.\n\nThe State Department is also announcing on Tuesday a streamlined process for DACA recipients and other undocumented immigrants who have graduated from U.S. colleges to more easily obtain employment-based visas, such as H-1B visas for high-skilled workers.",

        "text": "Employers taking \u2018wait and see\u2019 approach before US presidential election\nThe United States presidential election takes place in a little over 4 months\u2019 time on 5 November. Voters will decide between incumbent President Joe Biden and his Democratic Party, and former Republican President Donald Trump with the winner inaugurated on January 20, 2025. The polls suggest it is a tight race which means there is uncertainty over the country\u2019s legislative programme. Legislation, which is currently making progress may, or may not, become law by 5 November and, even if it does become law, a Tump administration could reverse it very quickly.\n\n\n\nThat uncertainty is a problem if you are a business with a presence in the US trying to plan ahead. For example:\n\n\n\nThe FTC\u2019s non-compete rule on course to become law on 4 September unless one of the many legal challenges to it proves successful. The rule operates to ban most post-employment non-compete agreements between employers and their workers. It\u2019s a very big deal for employers concerned about how to protect the business if the rule passes.\n\n\n\nThere is also Biden\u2019s plan to extend mandatory overtime pay to an estimated 4 million salaried workers. That would require employers to pay overtime premiums to workers who earn a salary of less than $1,128 per week, or about $58,600 per year, when they work more than 40 hours in a week.\n\n\n\nThere is also the expansion of what constitutes protected employee concerted activity under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act. This is where two or more employees act together to improve the terms and conditions of their employment. Over the past decade, the parameters of protected concerted activity have expanded and contracted, based on the objectives of the NLRB under different political administrations making compliance challenging and means employers need to be cautious when taking disciplinary action against employees who have complained about their wages, hours, or working conditions.\n\n\n\nSo let\u2019s get a view on how the current uncertainty is affecting employers. Scott LeBlanc is an employment lawyer in the US at law firm Husch Blackwell in Wisconsin and earlier he joined me by video-link phone to discuss it. First the election in November:\n\n\n\nScott Le Blanc: \u201cRight, so obviously we have the presidential elections and with that comes the congressional elections coming up at the beginning of November and so anytime we are only a couple months away from an election, an election that, particularly this year, but you know, anytime that we have a large federal election, if there's a change in power there's going to be a lot of changes with respect to laws in many different areas, labour and employment included. So we've got a couple of different things that are going on right now that our clients are wrestling with and they're asking us, what do we do in the meantime between now and the election and a lot of times our answer is it's really wait and see.\u201d\n\n\n\nJoe Glavina: \u201cOne of the areas of uncertainty, Scott, is around the expansion of what constitutes Protected Concerted Activity under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act. Can you tell me about that and the role of the NLRB?\u201d\n\n\n\nScott Le Blanc: \u201cSo, the National Labor Relations Board, of all of the federal agencies that we have, and we talked a little bit about the Federal Trade Commission which is the agency that covers the non-compete rule, the Department of Labor which is the agency that enforces the salary basis rule. The National Labour Relations Board, which is concerned with, essentially, union organising activity in the United States is the one federal agency in the labor and employment space that is probably the most affected whenever there's a change in power in the White House. When there is a Republican administration in the White House we tend to have a very hands-off National Labour Relations Board and when there is a Democratic administration in the White House we tend to have a National Labor Relations Board that does everything in their power to try and encourage employees to exercise their rights to unionise and to give unions a leg up in negotiations. So we had four years of a National Labor Relations Board under President Trump from 2016 to 2020. That was followed up by President Biden coming in with a lot of organised labor support and his national Labor Relations Board has been very activist as far as going after employers for things like independent contractor misclassification, electronic monitoring of communications, cracking down on things like non-disclosure agreements. You mentioned Protected Concerted Activity, and this was a theme that first came up in the Obama-Biden administration from 2008 to 2016, which is essentially this concept of non-union employees having certain rights under the National Labor Relations Act to get together and to discuss terms and conditions of their employment and that's called Protected Concerted Activity. So these are the union rules that apply even to non-unionised workplaces and that that is difficult for clients because usually our clients that have unionised workforces understand the scheme and how to work with unions but non-union employers generally tend to think that they don't have any obligations with respect to union rights and so this is something that often is sort of off their radar. So the Obama-Biden administration kicked off this real push toward protecting concerted activity and back then it was really focused on social media policies. The idea that social media is a water cooler for employees to be able to get together and discuss terms and conditions of their employment and gripes that they might have about unfair conditions in the workplace and that's come back under the Biden administration with, I think, even more aggression from an enforcement standpoint at the National Labor Relations Board than we saw under President Obama. We had a recent case that involved an employee at Home Depot who was disciplined for writing Black Lives Matter on their on their work gear and that was determined by the National Labor Relations Board to be protected concerted activity because they interpreted that as a statement of looking for mutual aid and protection in the workplace, not necessarily just a political statement. So they've looked for these opportunities to advance this idea of protected concerted activity. I think, ultimately, the goal is they want employees to feel empowered and, ultimately, that's going to lead to more employees getting together, realising that they have the ability to collectively bargain and form a union. So that's the ultimate goal here and they're trying to open the doors for that type of activity as much as possible in these non-union workplaces.\u201d\n\n\n\nJoe Glavina: \u201cSo given the uncertainty around this which you\u2019ve talked about, what is the problem facing employers?\u201d\n\n\n\nScott Le Blanc: \u201dWhere this tends to trip up employers is in things like employee handbook policies that speak to things like you can't make statements on behalf of the company, non-disparagement language in employee handbooks, codes of conduct that talk about things like maintaining proper decorum in the workplace. That's the kind of language, this sort of civility language in the workplace, that the National Labor Relations Board is getting really touchy about which they think has the chilling effect on protected concerted activity. Certainly if you're in the middle of an NLRB audit, or an issue that you're dealing directly with the NLRB, where they've highlighted those types of policies as a problem you're going to want to make those changes but if you've so far stayed off the National Labor Relations Board\u2019s radar, and you're not particularly inclined to pick through your employee policies to make sure that none of your language around decorum and appropriate activity and, you know, talking through the right channels in the workplace which may or may not fall foul of what the NLRB is looking at here you might want to wait until making those handbook policies. Generally, if we're asked to do an employee handbook we'll look at that kind of stuff and we'll point it out to clients and we can make a decision about whether or not they want to incorporate, or make certain changes to their policies, but because we're getting closer and closer to an election, and if the Trump administration were to come into power, I think those policies would almost certainly fall off the radar for the NLRB with respect to enforcement. It might be a time where you might want to wait to update your employee handbook until January of 2025.\u201d\n\n\n\nScott went on to talk about those two other major areas of uncertainty in the US, the FTC\u2019s non-compete rule, which is set to come into force on 4 September, if it survives legal challenge, and also Biden\u2019s plan to extend mandatory overtime pay to an estimated 4 million salaried workers. We\u2019ll be covering both of those next week so do watch this space.",

        "text": "Expert Take: How Will the Sheinbaum Presidency Impact Mexico?\nOn June 2nd, Claudia Sheinbaum, the Sigamos Haciendo Historia candidate, was elected president, making history as the first female to hold Mexico's highest elected office. While Sheinbaum's campaign platform and initial comments following her recent election closely reflected the current policy priorities of her predecessor and founder of the political party, Morena, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, much is to be determined about how a Sheinbaum presidency will impact Mexico. Eight experts share their perspectives on how Claudia Sheinbaum may impact the country's trajectory from security and rule of law, to distribution of wealth, migration, and relationship with the private sector.\n\nHow do you foresee the Sheinbaum presidency impacting the US-Mexico relationship?\n\nBy: Ambassador Earl Anthony Wayne\n\nUS-Mexico relations will be tough to manage for the months ahead and could become more challenging to guide depending on the outcome of the November US elections. Yet, there is reason to be hopeful that Claudia Sheinbaum will bring a reasoned and better-coordinated approach to engaging with the United States.\n\nOn a very basic level, current president Andres Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador (AMLO) regularly focused on feeding his domestic audience with morning press conferences during which he would often ad-lib his response to many controversial issues including those involving the US: a DEA statement about fentanyl, the State Department\u2019s Human Right\u2019s report, a critical New York Times article, or a grating statement by a member of the US Congress. President Sheinbaum will certainly defend her views and Mexico\u2019s positions, but she does not appear to be as confrontational as her soon-to-be predecessor.\n\nThose who have worked with her over the years say Sheinbaum\u2019s approach to dealing with problems tends to reflect the scientist she was trained to be -- methodical and listening seriously to a range of options. These terms rarely apply to AMLO, despite being a very skilled politician. Her problem-solving approach should establish a good basis for working through difficult issues on the US-Mexico agenda, including on cross-border crime, migration management, and trade.\n\nUnlike AMLO, who tends to view the US through the lens of Mexican domestic politics, Sheinbaum and her family members have lived in the US and know its strengths and weaknesses. This should give her and US counterparts a better opportunity to find shared solutions or identify additional channels for collaboration on big issues that arise, or at a minimum to better understand why the US may be \u201cunreasonable.\u201d Yes, this happens.\n\nSheinbaum understands that the key for Mexico\u2019s continued growth and prosperity is to stay locked into the mutual production and value chains of North America. This will open opportunities for Mexico\u2019s small and medium enterprises and attract job-creating investment and nearshoring. Sheinbaum has also already indicated an openness to pursuing renewable energy and partnering with the private sector from the US and elsewhere to attract the funding needed to develop these options for Mexico.\n\nIn tackling public security and crime, Sheinbaum demonstrated during her tenure as Mexico City mayor that she supported establishing good policing and sound capacity building to get the criminals off the streets. Her public security team worked well with US counterparts, which bodes well for better bilateral cooperation going forward. This is desperately needed.\n\nProblems and differences will remain, but I am optimistic about the prospects for good collaboration.\n\nHow do you foresee the Sheinbaum presidency impacting security and rule of law in Mexico?\n\nBy: Cecilia Farf\u00e1n-M\u00e9ndez\n\nFirst and foremost, the administration should not underestimate the magnitude of the challenge they face. Even with a slight decrease, the homicide rate in Mexico of 25.4 per 100,000 is well above the Latin America average of 15.8 per 100,000, which is the highest in the world. The forensic crisis of unidentified remains and over 100,000 disappearances is further deteriorating without meaningful resources to address it and there is a well-documented expansion of protection rackets targeting the private sector that could negatively impact nearshoring ambitions.\n\nPer her campaign statements, President Sheinbaum will continue using the Armed Forces for the provision of public security in Mexico. This is concerning because there is robust evidence that shows that this, in fact, undermines citizen security and can result in Human Rights violations, particularly for women and girls. Worryingly, the continuous militarization of public security is not a concern for the average citizen, and I believe the Sheinbaum administration will take advantage of this. Per the Survey of the Quality of Democracy in Mexico, in 2024, 69% of the population feels \u201csafe\u201d or \u201csomewhat safe\u201d using the Armed Forces against organized crime even if 51% think the Armed Forces cut deals with criminal groups and 40% do not think the Armed Forces are held accountable by civilian institutions. Importantly, the Armed Forces will likely capitalize on these high levels of trust, even if there is also perceived corruption within their ranks, to continue pushing for expanded budgets and resources to the detriment of developing civilian institutions for public security in Mexico.\n\nHow do you foresee the Sheinbaum presidency impacting relations with the private sector in Mexico?\n\nBy: Gustavo Almaraz and Mariana Raphael\n\nA Sheinbaum presidency in Mexico is poised to shape relations with the private sector through a blend of pragmatism, technical expertise, and political dynamics. Known for her openness to dialogue with businesses, Sheinbaum has a track record of fostering public-private partnerships, particularly in infrastructure and environmental initiatives during her tenure as mayor of Mexico City. This inclination suggests a collaborative approach that could benefit sectors aligned with her agenda, such as renewable energy and sustainable development.\n\nHer technical background and reliance on well-prepared advisors indicate a methodical approach to governance, likely bringing stability and predictability to regulatory frameworks. This could reassure investors and encourage long-term planning among businesses.\n\nHowever, navigating the USMCA review in 2026 will be crucial. Sheinbaum will need to balance Mexico's international trade commitments with domestic policy priorities, particularly in sectors like automotive manufacturing and agriculture.\n\nThe influence of President Lopez Obrador remains pivotal. If allowed to govern with her distinct style, Sheinbaum's presidency could chart a course characterized by proactive engagement with the private sector, leveraging her majority in Congress and at local levels to enact policies conducive to economic growth and social equity. This alignment of political support provides a strong foundation for effective governance, potentially fostering an environment where businesses thrive under a balanced regulatory framework.\n\nUltimately, while challenges and opportunities will arise, Sheinbaum's presidency has the potential to redefine private-sector relations in Mexico through collaboration, technical expertise, and strategic governance.\n\nHow do you foresee the Sheinbaum presidency addressing the challenges of migration?\n\nBy: Carlos Heredia\n\nMexico militarized its immigration policy during AMLO\u2019s term (2018-2024), heavily influenced by U.S. national security concerns. The promised humanitarian approach to migration and human rights never materialized. The total impunity of high government officials after the incineration of 40 migrants in a government facility in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez on March 27, 2023, is AMLO\u2019s legacy: migrants in transit through Mexico are used as a bargaining chip to be traded away for political expediency.\n\nWith significant assistance from the United Nations, asylum and refuge were the only responsibilities that this government seemed to deliver, but that department was permanently understaffed and underfunded.\n\nPresident Biden\u2019s June 5th, 2024 decree to unilaterally redefine asylum and refuge will bring a larger number of asylum seekers stranded in Mexico, where significant segments of our territory are controlled by organized crime.\n\nIronically, while some in Mexico, the United States, and Canada describe North America as the most competitive region in the world, the rights of Mexican undocumented migrants in the U.S. are not guaranteed. Now that the three countries experience a shortage of workers, a blueprint to regulate labor mobility is needed, even against the political odds.\n\nFuture president Sheinbaum says she will address the root causes of migration in Mexico and the region, but key officials in her administration starting October 1st, are already discussing the continuity of militarized immigration containment. Her huge victory at the polls means no incentive for change, so beyond the speeches, I do not foresee a departure from current practices.\n\nHow do you foresee the Sheinbaum presidency impacting Mexico's energy sector?\n\nBy: Alejandra Le\u00f3n\n\nClaudia Sheinbaum approaches energy with a distinct perspective from the current administration. While many perceive her policies as a continuation of L\u00f3pez Obrador's, her true focus lies in expediting the energy transition. Her rhetoric suggests a continuation of the existing energy policy for the next six years, including controlled increases in gasoline, electricity, and LPG prices, strengthening of Pemex and CFE, maintaining 54% power generation by CFE, upgrading existing refineries, utilizing the Olmeca refinery for self-sufficiency, advancing Plan Sonora, and refraining from fracking for hydrocarbon production. However, Sheinbaum's rhetoric also highlights her commitment to energy transition through the construction of renewable plants, distributed energy systems, solar heaters for residential and commercial use, support for petrochemicals and fertilizers, and the promotion of electromobility in major cities. The logic behind this rhetoric is a topic for another debate.\n\nNonetheless, Sheinbaum acknowledges the reality that replacing hydrocarbons within a six-year timeframe necessitates substantial financial resources. Not only must new energy supplies be built, but consumers must also be incentivized to make the switch. In the best-case scenario, she can meet the expected moderate growth in energy demand with clean energy sources. However, securing private capital efficiently remains a challenge. It is crucial to avoid corruption, obtain cost-efficient technology in a timely manner, and comply with the restrictions imposed by commercial partners. Furthermore, the investment synergy resulting from the 2013 energy reform has largely dissipated. Of note, China is the leader in the supply chain of renewable energy and electromobility; increasing trade and investment from China will increase economic risk during the USMCA revision in 2026. Between 2016 and 2023 Mexico increased an average 6% per year its exports to the US, the same growth rate as Mexican imports from China.\n\nConsidering these factors, it remains unclear how Sheinbaum intends to achieve sufficient, affordable, and clean energy to benefit the Mexican population and enhance Mexico's competitiveness. There are significant obstacles to overcome in realizing her vision.\n\nHow do you foresee the Sheinbaum presidency impacting pending plans for judicial reform?\n\nBy: Alexandra Helfgott\n\nReform to Mexico\u2019s judicial system has been a significant priority for AMLO, but previous efforts have not been successful. Yet, given Morena and its allies\u2019 dominance in both chambers of Congress, AMLO has promised to present the proposed judicial reform to the newly-elected Congress in September, before he leaves office on October 1 \u2013 a final act of his presidency. Though the exact nature of the judicial reform is evolving (it is certain to include the direct, popular election of members of the judicial branch \u2013 scale and scope to be determined), and whether the legislation will ultimately pass is still undecided, mere discussions of the pending reform have already had implications, such as the peso\u2019s nearly 2% drop in value following Sheinbaum\u2019s comments promising to pursue the reform shortly after the election.\n\nThe passage of this reform would further politicize Mexico\u2019s judicial branch, incentivize actions that favor popularity, rather than judicial wellbeing and expertise, and would do little, if anything, to address issues of corruption \u2013 the purported primary purpose of the reform. Not only would the passage of the judicial reform represent a direct threat to democracy and rule of law in Mexico, but more concretely, it would also have significant implications for the country\u2019s competitiveness, particularly when it comes to foreign investment. Both current and former US government officials have commented that the passage of this reform would undoubtedly affect the US-Mexico relationship, particularly as the USMCA\u2019s 2026 review looms on the horizon. Sheinbaum, for her part, has sought to assuage concerns about the pending reform, emphasizing the strength of Mexico\u2019s economy and also promising to hold public consultations throughout the summer on the judicial reform \u2013 though AMLO has already said that the reform will be approved in September.\n\nHow do you foresee the Sheinbaum presidency addressing the challenges of climate change and the environment?\n\nBy: Tania Miranda\n\nClaudia Sheinbaum, an engineer and climate scientist, is viewed by many as the President who will finally prioritize climate change on Mexico\u2019s national agenda. As the country grapples with climate emergencies, including heat stress, water scarcity, and devastating hurricanes, the need for decisive action has never been more urgent. However, her alignment with her predecessor's rhetoric may pose challenges for Mexico's first female President.\n\nDespite the importance of biodiversity in a megadiverse country like Mexico, it is noticeably absent from Sheinbaum's plans. Her campaign platform mentioned biodiversity only once, in the context of food sovereignty. There was no reference to natural protected areas (NPAs), and the environmental section focused mainly on water basin recovery and water access, with only a brief mention of reforestation and forest protection. Moreover, she supports the Tren Maya infrastructure project, which threatens important biodiversity hotspots of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula.\n\nOn a positive note, Sheinbaum appears committed to expanding renewable energy sources and distributed generation. She also plans to invest in the decarbonization of the transportation sector through electromobility, which could significantly improve air quality and mitigate climate change, as the energy sector\u2014including power generation and transportation fuels\u2014accounts for over 60% of the country\u2019s CO2 emissions. However, energy is just one part of the equation. In Mexico, 36% of CO2 emissions and the majority of other potent greenhouse gases (GHGs) originate from other sectors, such as agriculture and livestock.\n\nSheinbaum is expected to continue supporting the national utility CFE and the national oil company Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos, both of which lag in the energy transition and could divert valuable resources. Additionally, she will need to decide whether to permit the expansion of U.S.-owned LNG export terminals along Mexico\u2019s coasts, which could substantially increase GHG emissions.\n\nGiven her involvement in drafting key UN climate reports, it is assumed that she will take Mexico\u2019s international climate commitments seriously, including the Paris Agreement\u2019s Nationally Determined Contributions and the 30x30 goal from the Global Biodiversity Framework. Her cabinet appointments and Mexico\u2019s participation in upcoming biodiversity and climate summits this October and November will provide insights into her environmental agenda. We will see what tomorrow brings, but it is the responsibility of all of us working on climate issues to encourage her to move forward with the net-zero transition, in a political environment that moves in the opposite direction.",

        "text": "How could the US presidential election impact the US dollar?\n[author: Katie Keith]\n\nNumerous countries are holding elections in 2024, but none are likely to have as far-reaching an impact at this year\u2019s US Presidential election.\n\nThe stakes are high not only for domestic policies but also for the global economy. Given its status as the world\u2019s primary reserve currency, the election\u2019s impact on the US dollar may be felt across the globe.\n\nBut how exactly will the expected contest between Joe Biden and Donald Trump in 2024 influence the trajectory of the US dollar in the coming months?\n\nHow has the US dollar performed under President Biden?\n\nSince taking office in January 2021, Biden has pursued an expansionary fiscal policy, including significant infrastructure spending and stimulus measures.\n\nThis initially contributed to a weaker US dollar through 2021, before the sharp acceleration of inflation in 2022 propelled USD exchange rates to a 20-year high as the Federal Reserve was forced to start tightening its monetary policy.\n\nThe effectiveness of Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) subsequently led to a moderation and stabilization of the US dollar through 2023, but ultimately USD exchange rates remain higher than when Biden first took office.\n\nWho is likely to win?\n\nThis time last year it seemed that Biden would comfortably beat Trump in a rematch of the 2020 election.\n\nHowever, less than six months out from the election, national polls suggest that Biden and Trump are virtually neck-and-neck.\n\nThis comes amid an eroding of Biden\u2019s support base, with younger voters growing despondent over the President\u2019s handling of the conflict in Gaza.\n\nOn a state-by-state basis, polls suggest Trump is leading in a number of battleground states, which may be key to swinging the election in the Republican\u2019s favour, although pollsters point out this is well within bounds of statistical error.\n\nHowever, Trump\u2019s legal woes remain a major concern for the former president, and a formal conviction could derail his 2024 campaign.\n\nHow could the election impact the US dollar?\n\nA general rule of thumb is that investors are not fans of political uncertainty. Therefore, the US presidential election and its aftermath are likely to bring about increased volatility in USD, particularly if the polling numbers remain close.\n\nAs for how victory for each candidate may impact the US dollar, it\u2019s difficult to say, however, looking at how previous election results impacted USD exchange rates may offer us some insight.\n\nBiden victory\n\nThe continuity and stability offered by a second term for Biden may be welcomed by USD investors, at least in the short-term.\n\nLonger term the focus will be on Biden\u2019s domestic priorities, particularly regarding his fiscal policy.\n\nPlans for increased government spending, particularly on healthcare, education, and renewable energy initiatives could lead to higher deficits and increased borrowing, potentially putting downward pressure on the US dollar if not matched by sufficient economic growth.\n\nOn the other hand, such policies could also stoke inflationary pressures within the US. This could strengthen the US dollar if it pushes the Federal Reserve to maintain its restrictive monetary policy for longer.\n\nElsewhere, if the Biden administration follows through with promises to raise taxes for corporations and the wealthy, could a flight of capital trigger some weakness in the US dollar?\n\nTrump victory\n\nWhile markets might initially welcome a Trump victory due to expectations of pro-business policies, ongoing trade disputes and geopolitical tensions could infuse significant volatility into the US dollar. During his first term, Trump pursued a more protectionist trade policy, which led to trade tensions with several countries, most notably China.\n\nThese tensions and the associated tariffs had mixed effects on the US dollar, as they simultaneously increased uncertainty and boosted demand for safe-haven assets.\n\nIf Trump were to win a second term, it is expected that his administration would continue to prioritise protectionist policies, which may lead to further trade disputes and geopolitical tensions.\n\nSuch an environment could result in increased volatility for the US dollar, as investors react to changing trade dynamics and assess the potential impact on global economic growth.",

The Kennedy campaign has poured millions into getting on the ballot in all 50 states, each of which has different rules for independent candidates.\n\nThe campaign says it has collected enough petition signatures to get on the ballot in 23 states, totalling 310 electoral votes.\n\nHowever, the campaign acknowledges that only nine states \u2013 totalling just 144 electoral votes - have actually confirmed that RFK Jr will appear on the ballot.\n\nThe Kennedy campaign has lodged a complaint with the FEC, arguing that Mr Biden and Trump have not yet been nominated by their respective parties and thus are not officially on the ballot in any states.\n\nThe campaign has accused CNN of failing to apply objective criteria in deciding who makes the debate stage and have alleged that the broadcast next Thursday amounts to a prohibited \u201ccampaign contribution\u201d.\n\nCNN has said that Mr Kennedy\u2019s complaints are baseless. The broadcaster declined to comment when reached by the BBC on Thursday.",

        "text": "The National Task Force on Election Crises\nCandidate Succession Before Election Day\n\nIn the unfortunate event that a presidential candidate dies, becomes incapacitated, or resigns before Election Day, political parties have established procedures to replace that candidate and continue with the election. Our political system and election laws rely on political parties to determine a replacement. In the rare instances in U.S. history in which this has happened, political parties have worked effectively to do so.\n\n\n\nPolitical parties have control over the process of replacing their candidates.\n\nBefore Election Day, the political parties have principal control over how to handle a dead or incapacitated candidate, or one who steps down. No constitutional or statutory provisions cover this scenario and there is strong legal and historical precedent for party control. Indeed, before the era of modern presidential primaries, parties assumed total control of the nomination process and hand-picked the nominees without direct voter input.\n\nThe exact rules for the process of nominee succession hinge on the timing of when a candidate dies, steps down, or becomes incapacitated:\n\nBefore the conventions\n\nIf a presidential candidate dies, becomes incapacitated or steps down before the party conventions, the party delegates would select their nominee at the convention from among other candidates or new entrants.\n\nAfter the conventions\n\nIf a death or incapacity arises after the convention, the two major political parties each have rules for selecting a substitution:\n\nDemocrats: the members of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) would choose the new nominee by majority vote in a special session called by the chair. The DNC chair is required to consult with Democratic congressional leadership and the Democratic Governors Association, and then reports to DNC members who choose.\n\nThis process was used in 1972, for example, when the Democratic Vice Presidential nominee Thomas Eagleton withdrew his nomination and the DNC members voted to replace him on the ticket with Sargent Shriver.\n\nRepublicans: the Republican National Committee has the power to fill vacancies resulting from \u201cdeath, declination, or otherwise.\u201d Members would vote as part of their state delegation under the same vote distribution used for the convention itself, and delegation members could divide their votes if they did not agree. Alternatively, the Republicans could reconvene the national convention.\n\nElection Laws Control How Ballots are Changed and Counted\n\nGeneral election ballots are generally not printed before early fall and changes can typically be made to the ballots before that time. As it gets closer to Election Day, there would be increasing issues about whether ballots can or should be reprinted and other logistical adjustments can be made. Several administrative processes in the lead-up to elections make last-minute changes difficult. For example, election administrators must conduct pre-election programming and testing before ballots are printed. In addition, at least some ballots must be printed well in advance of Election Day to accommodate military and overseas voting as well as absentee or mail-in voting as permitted in the jurisdiction. A combination of federal and state law governs such processes and as such is not uniform across jurisdictions. This lack of uniformity could contribute to confusion.\n\nDespite the tumult the death, resignation or incapacitation of a presidential candidate would surely cause, one protection built into the system is that in a presidential election voters cast their ballots not for a candidate but for a slate of electors pledged to a candidate. In some cases, the names of the state Electoral College electors appear on the ballot. Even where a replaced presidential or vice presidential candidate\u2019s name might remain on the ballot, votes for that candidate\u2019s electors would still count and those electors \u2013 who are chosen by the parties, usually on the basis of strong loyalty \u2013 could transfer their votes to the party\u2019s replacement nominee (depending on state law).\n\nConclusion\n\nU.S. political parties put voters at the center of the U.S. presidential selection process. But political parties operate as an important safeguard to ensure a rules-based process should a presidential candidate who voters choose in the primary and convention process die, step down or otherwise become incapacitated. It is well within our political norms and the laws of our election processes for a political party to manage such an unfortunate event. Voters should feel confident that political parties and states have rules in place that anticipate such contingencies.",

Kennedy has failed to qualify for the presidential debate with President Biden and former President Donald Trump. The debate will be hosted by CNN next week in Atlanta, on June 27. Kennedy had until 12:00:01 a.m. ET Thursday to fulfill the debate requirements.\n\nUnder CNN's criteria, a candidate must appear on a sufficient number of state ballots to be eligible to win 270 electoral votes, the number needed to win the presidency. Kennedy is on the ballot in five states \u2014 Utah, Michigan, Delaware, Oklahoma and Tennessee \u2014 for a total of 42 electoral votes. He'll also be on the ballot in California as the nominee of the American Independent Party, and in Hawaii, on his We the People ticket, which adds up to 100 potential electoral votes.\n\nThough Kennedy has submitted petitions for ballot access in a number of states, several of his applications are still being reviewed by the state election offices.\n\nCandidates were also required to reach a polling threshold of 15% in four major national polls by June 20. According to CNN, Kennedy fell short, with three qualifying national polls.\n\n\"Presidents Biden and Trump do not want me on the debate stage and CNN illegally agreed to their demand,\" Kennedy said in a statement. \"My exclusion by Presidents Biden and Trump from the debate is undemocratic, un-American, and cowardly.\"\n\nIn May, Kennedy's campaign filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission accusing CNN, Mr. Biden, Trump and their campaigns of violating federal election law.\n\nThe Kennedy campaign claims CNN approached the debate criteria differently for Kennedy than for Trump and Mr. Biden, the presumptive nominees of their respective parties. The debate will take place before either the Democratic Party or the Republican Party hold their conventions to formalize their nominees. The Kennedy campaign is alleging the debate is an illegal campaign contribution to both Mr. Biden and Trump\n\n\"By demanding our campaign meet different criteria to participate in the debate than Presidents Biden and Trump, CNN's debate violates FEC law and is a large prohibited corporate contribution to both the Biden and Trump campaigns,\" Kennedy said.\n\nKennedy says that he cannot file a lawsuit until the FCC complaint is dismissed. His campaign says that the FEC stated there might be merit in his complaint and won't dismiss it, but it has not yet reached a decision. The FEC declined to comment.",

The invitation was extended in accordance with the agreement signed by the government of Venezuela and the Unitary Platform in Barbados in October 2023.\n\nThe international mission will be led by Jennie Lincoln, the Carter Center\u2019s senior advisor on Latin America and the Caribbean. Lincoln and a core team of experts will arrive in Caracas on June 29.

The mission\u2019s assessments will be based on the national legal framework as well as regional and international human rights obligations and standards for democratic elections.\n\nThe Carter Center has observed several elections in Venezuela, most recently in 2021 when it deployed an expert mission for the regional and local elections.

        "text": "Event Recap: 2024 Election Insights\nElections inevitably come with uncertainty. As candidates express differing visions for the direction the country will take, it\u2019s only natural to be concerned about how the outcome could affect different aspects of life for you and your family \u2013 and that includes your finances and investments.\n\nWith the 2024 presidential campaign heating up, J.P. Morgan Wealth Management presented a webcast on May 9 about the possible financial impacts of the election. Moderator Shelby Anderson, Executive Director of J.P. Morgan Wealth Management Wealth Planning & Advice, spoke with Shawn Snyder, Executive Director and Global Investment Strategist at J.P. Morgan, on a range of topics \u2013 from the historical performance of the markets around election time to the potential tax and investment implications of this year\u2019s contest.\n\nThe speakers suggested that, although elections can be stressful, you\u2019ll probably be better off if you avoid any overreactions when it comes to your financial strategy. But even if election season is no reason to panic, it\u2019s important to be aware of how the results at the ballot box could impact your wallet and your portfolio. Here are some highlights from the webcast to help you understand the possible financial repercussions of the 2024 election.\n\nStock market performance around the election\n\nThere may be some misconceptions about how financial markets react to presidential races. During the webcast, Snyder addressed the \u201cfrequent belief that if candidate so and so wins, the stock market is going to crash.\u201d Despite the political passion behind the idea, this scenario has never really played out.\n\nIn fact, if you\u2019ve heard that markets hate uncertainty, it may come as no surprise that stocks tend to rally after the election as uncertainty dissipates. When post-election downturns do hit the markets, it is often a symptom of the wider economic backdrop rather than an identifiable unfavorable market reaction to the newly elected president.\n\nSector impacts\n\nThis is not to say that the winner of the race to the White House has zero influence over the performance of the stock market. Of course, presidential policies and decisions can shape the economy on many levels. For stock investors, election impact tends to be felt most at the sector level.\n\nThe general tendency is for financial stocks to outperform ahead of elections, with an expectation that whoever becomes president will try to bolster growth with new policy initiatives. Health care tends to do better under Democrats, while energy may be boosted under Republican leadership.\n\nThe 2024 campaign is a rare case in that the presumptive nominees from both major parties have been president before. This provides us with a historical reference of what happened in the markets when they took over the Oval Office.\n\nFinancials, industrials, and aerospace and defense stocks did well after Donald Trump won the election in 2016, while infrastructure stocks outperformed following Joe Biden\u2019s victory in 2020. The post-election stock market gains were stronger in 2020, but that also coincided with positive vaccine news, demonstrating once again that factors beyond the election results can influence the markets.\n\nWhile the familiar faces and our knowledge of what happened after the past two elections give us some hints about what we might expect this time around, there is no guarantee that the same developments will repeat in 2024.\n\nTax implications\n\nRegardless of who wins the presidency this year, many provisions from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 are set to expire in 2025. This means lawmakers will have to decide on how to tackle changes to the tax code, striking a balance between even higher national debt and raising taxes. Expiration of the 2017 tax law would lead to higher taxes for most U.S. households.\n\nOf course, the shape of the tax code moving forward depends not only on the outcome of the presidential election but also on congressional results. Party control over the House and the Senate remains uncertain, and it\u2019s even possible that both chambers could switch hands following the 2024 election.\n\nRepublicans may support extending the tax cuts and propose major cuts to nondefense spending, while Democrats could favor tax hikes on corporations and wealthier individuals. However, given the likelihood of a divided government, both parties may have to compromise \u2013 perhaps leaving taxes slightly higher but with little deficit reduction.\n\nOther policy outcomes\n\nTariffs are another area where the major presidential candidates hold different opinions and viewpoints. Trump favors a 10% tariff on all goods imported into the U.S. and a 60% tariff on all imports from China, whereas Biden plans to reassess tariffs but recently announced his own tough stance on China, levying significant tariffs on imports from the country including steel, semiconductors and electric vehicles. Tariffs can affect economic growth and may benefit or harm particular sectors or companies.\n\nThe candidates also have distinct viewpoints on climate and energy policy. A second Trump administration would aim to increase energy production by drilling on federal land and extending pipelines, whereas Biden would aim to reduce emissions and increase energy efficiency.\n\nIncreased production and targeted deregulation under Trump could benefit some companies in the energy sector, but greater energy supply could also lead to lower prices, so the benefits for oil and gas stocks may not be as pronounced as some might expect. Meanwhile, if Biden remains in the White House, assets linked to renewable energy might find more support, but traditional oil and gas companies could come under pressure.\n\nAlthough Trump and Biden have diverging priorities when it comes to geopolitical and domestic security views, defense spending is likely to remain robust under either candidate.\n\nBottom line\n\nWhile there is a lot on the line in the upcoming election \u2013 including potential impacts on your money \u2013 the bottom line is that election outcomes have not driven market outcomes over the long term. There may be volatility leading up to Election Day, but there is no evidence of a clear, long-term impact on the markets or the economy.\n\nWith that in mind, it\u2019s important to be aware of the election\u2019s potential effects so that you can adjust your investing and financial strategies accordingly, but you shouldn\u2019t let your stress or excitement about the political landscape interfere with your long-term financial strategy.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t let that emotion get the best of you,\u201d Anderson advised during the webcast. \u201cYou know, make sure that you are creating a plan \u2013 that you are revisiting it often, or periodically, especially as life circumstances change \u2013 but not letting the emotion in what can seem like a very stressful time leading up to elections really drive our decision making.\u201d",

        "text": "Election 2024: Will Next Week\u2019s Debate Shake Up the Presidential Race?\nPolitical aficionados longing to move past an anti-climactic nominating season will soon get their wish. Unless something unexpected happens, President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump will square off in a debate hosted by CNN next Thursday night. Both campaigns hope that the ninety-minute faceoff will turn Election 2024 decisively in their favor.\n\nHow much any presidential debate matters to the outcome in November is a matter of conjecture. U.S. history is replete with debates that seemed in the heat of the moment to have changed the tide but ultimately didn\u2019t. Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama each famously flopped in their first debates when they sought reelection. Both men then went on to resounding victories.\n\nHow candidates perform on the debate stage would seem to matter most in tight races. That was the case in the three elections typically held up as examples of where debates determined the outcome: the Kennedy-Nixon debate in 1960, the Ford-Carter debate in 1976, and the Carter-Reagan debate in 1980. The first is remembered for Richard Nixon\u2019s five o\u2019clock shadow, the second for Gerald Ford insisting the Soviet Union wasn\u2019t dominating Eastern Europe, and the third for Ronald Reagan assuring viewers that he was reasonable rather than reckless.\n\nThe Water's Edge James M.

But one difference sets it apart from past presidential debates: It is not being held weeks before Election Day but rather months. That will give both campaigns plenty of time, even with early voting starting in some states in late September, to clean up their candidate\u2019s mistakes and to pound their opponents.\n\nBiden and Trump, of course, want to avoid mistakes. To that end, Biden is headed off to Camp David this weekend for intensive debate prep. The Biden team\u2019s messages to press on background is that the president will try to use Thursday\u2019s debate to \u201cremind tuned-out Americans of the former president\u2019s many controversies.\u201d In doing so, Biden will be trying to get into \u201ccampaign shape\u201d and to avoid repeating Reagan\u2019s and Obama\u2019s overconfidence.\n\nTrump is taking a different approach to preparing for next Thursday. Rather than holing up with trusted advisers to pore over briefing books, he has been on the phone with a range of advisers and holding rallies for his supporters. The Trump team\u2019s message is that the forty-fifth president doesn\u2019t need to be \u201ccoached up\u201d by subject-matter experts. Rallies and phone calls are all he needs to prepare.\n\nOne wild card for the debate is whether the U.S. Supreme Court will release its decision on Trump\u2019s claim that he is immune from criminal prosecution for all actions he took as president. The Court\u2019s annual session ends next Friday, and it has yet to issue its ruling. It may wait until Friday to hand down its decision to avoid charges it is trying to influence the debate. But if it releases a ruling before then, the moderators\u2014CNN anchors Dana Bash and Jake Tapper\u2014will have a whole new line of questions for both candidates.\n\nA wild card in all this is the debate\u2019s structure. There will be no audience. So Bash and Tapper won\u2019t be repeatedly asking people to quiet down. Neither Biden nor Trump will be allowed to bring props onstage, though they will be allowed a pen, a pad of paper, and a bottle of water. Both candidates will stand at a podium, and there will be one commercial break. Perhaps most consequentially, CNN will mute each candidate\u2019s microphone when their time is up. So the crosstalk that dominates\u2014and frequently undermines\u2014most debates should diminish.\n\nPundits will be parsing what Biden and Trump say in Atlanta. But as the Kennedy-Nixon debate illustrates, the debate could matter less for what either candidate says and more for how they appear or behave. Both campaign teams and their surrogates will be working the \u201cspin room\u201d onsite, and the multitude of cable and local news channels, to drive home a narrative that favors their candidate.\n\nPerhaps as consequential will be the debate clips that go viral on social media. George H.W. Bush came to rue checking his watch during his 1992 debate with Bill Clinton and Ross Perot. That was long before Facebook and Twitter were a gleam in anyone\u2019s eye. Now a faux pas can be watched and rewatched around the world before a debate even finishes.\n\nAn added worry is that a harmless moment can be turned by critics into a harmful one. The deceptively edited videos circulated last week purporting to show Biden wandering off during the G-7 summit show how a debate debacle can be conjured out of thin air even without resorting to AI and deepfakes. Such videos seem to be catnip on social media, where nearly one-third of Americans say they get their news. Many of them are what political strategists like to call \u201clow-information voters\u201d easily swayed by what they see because they know so little.\n\nSo, yes, a lot is at stake next Thursday, possibly including the outcome of the election.\n\nCampaign Update\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. failed to qualify for the June 27 debate. He did not meet either of CNN\u2019s criteria to be added to the debate stage: reaching at least 15 percent in four national polls and qualifying for enough state ballots to have the potential to win 270 Electoral College votes. Kennedy blamed his exclusion on his opponents: \u201cMy exclusion by Presidents Biden and Trump from the debate is undemocratic, un-American, and cowardly. Americans want an independent leader who will break apart the two-party duopoly.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s conviction last month on thirty-four felony counts may have been bad for him personally, but it did wonders for his fundraising. The latest Federal Election Committee numbers show Trump and the Republican National Committee raised $141 million in May. That\u2019s $60 million more than Biden and the Democratic National Committee raised. One donor gave Trump $50 million. The old saying that \u201cmoney is the mother\u2019s milk of politics\u201d comes to mind.\n\nWhat the Candidates Are Saying\n\nTrump pledged at a rally in Detroit last Saturday to cut U.S. aid to Ukraine. After calling the Ukrainian President \u201cthe greatest salesman of all time\u201d for his ability to persuade the United States to send military aid to Kyiv, Trump went on to claim that when it comes to the war in Ukraine, \u201cI will have that settled prior to taking the White House as president-elect.\u201d The former president seemed unaware that by both law and custom a president-elect should wait until taking the oath of office to begin negotiating with anyone.\n\nBiden announced a new policy on Tuesday that would enable immigrants who have been in the United States for at least a decade and are married to a U.S. citizen to apply for citizenship without first having to leave the country. U.S. policy had previously required such individuals to leave the United States before their spouse could sponsor them for a green card. The problem was, they had no guarantee they would be allowed to return. As a result, few people took that gamble to get citizenship. Biden administration officials say that the policy change will create a path to citizenship for half a million people.\n\nTrump issued a statement denouncing Biden\u2019s decision: \u201cBiden only cares about one thing\u2014power\u2014and that\u2019s why he is giving mass amnesty and citizenship to hundreds of thousands of illegals who he knows will ultimately vote for him and the Open Border Democrat Party.\u201d\n\nTrump said this week that he favored giving foreign students who graduate from U.S. colleges and universities the opportunity to become U.S. citizens. He told the All-In podcast: \u201cYou graduate from a college, I think you should get automatically as part of your diploma a green card to be able to stay in this country, and that includes junior colleges too.\u201d Trump did not pursue that idea when he was president. Rather, his administration was often hostile to legal immigration.\n\nWhat the Pundits Are Saying\n\nThe latest issue of Foreign Affairs has separate essays making the case for Biden\u2019s and Trump\u2019s foreign policies. Ben Rhodes, a deputy national security advisor under President Barack Obama, made the case for Biden. While gently criticizing Biden\u2019s \u201crestorationist\u201d foreign policy for failing to fully acknowledge that \u201cthe old rules-based international order doesn\u2019t really exist anymore,\u201d Rhodes argued that \u201cin its more affirmative agenda, the Biden administration is repositioning the United States for a changing world by focusing on the resilience of its own democracy and economy while rebooting alliances in Europe and Asia. To extend that regeneration into something more global and lasting, it should abandon the pursuit of primacy while embracing an agenda that can resonate with more of the world\u2019s governments and people.\u201d\n\nRobert O\u2019Brien, Trump\u2019s national security advisor from September 2019 through the end of his term, made the case for a second term Trump foreign policy. He portrayed Trump\u2019s four years in office as an unbroken string of successes in which \u201cTrump recognize[d] that a successful foreign policy requires joining forces with friendly governments and people elsewhere.\u201d (That characterization is debatable, to say the least.) O\u2019Brien predicted that \u201ca second Trump term would see the return of realism with a Jacksonian flavor. Washington\u2019s friends would be more secure and more self-reliant, and its foes would once again fear American power. The United States would be strong, and there would be peace.\u201d\n\nMike Levine of ABC News wrote that Kennedy is telling voters that the Central Intelligence Agency now controls major U.S. media outlets. Earlier this spring, Kennedy alleged that \u201cthe new head of NPR is a CIA agent.\u201d Levine argued that \u201cKennedy continues to amplify such claims at campaign events, in media interviews, and on social media, supporting them with what experts described to ABC News as \u2018half-truths,\u2019 \u2018intimations,\u2019 misinterpretations of law, and twisted historical anecdotes. He often cites widespread\u2014but utterly unsubstantiated\u2014allegations that a CIA program supposedly called \u2018Operation Mockingbird\u2019 secretly recruited journalists decades ago to help brainwash Americans.\u201d\n\nPolitico reported today that Washington and Seoul have begun talks a year early over Seoul\u2019s financial support for U.S. military bases in South Korea. The goal is to \u201cTrump-proof\u201d the alliance, at least in the short-term. During his time in office, Trump pressed South Korea for a more than five-fold increase in so-called host-country support, a demand that strained the alliance. The current Special Measures Agreement governing South Korea\u2019s support for U.S. military bases expires at the end of 2025. However, Seoul\u2019s effort to speed up negotiations \u201crisks reprisals if Donald Trump wins in November. They could include punitive financial burdens for South Korea that strain ties between Seoul and Washington amid rising regional tensions with both China and North Korea.\u201d\n\nWhat the Polls Show\n\nA poll commissioned by the Ronald Reagan Institute found rising public support for U.S. engagement in the world. The institute\u2019s poll last November found that just 42 percent of Americans favored greater U.S. engagement in the world. That number is now 54 percent. The poll\u2019s partisan split was relatively small. Two-thirds of Democrats favor great engagement, as do a near majority of Republicans (49 percent). Six in ten Americans polled had a favorable view of NATO.\n\nNational polling looks to have become friendlier to Biden. FiveThirtyEight reported today that for the first time this year that Biden leads Trump in its average of national polls. The margin is slight, 40.7 percent to 40.4 percent, with Kennedy drawing nearly 10 percent support. All the standard caveats apply about margins of error and the fact that presidents aren\u2019t chosen in a national vote but in the aggregation of votes in fifty states and one district.\n\nIt\u2019s not just Democratic-friendly polls that are showing a shift toward Biden. A Fox News poll released this week found that Biden has pulled ahead of Trump in its national poll of registered voters. Biden\u2019s 50-48 lead is the first time he has surpassed Trump in a Fox News poll since last October. Biden\u2019s lead fell to one point, 43-42, when Kennedy is added to the mix. These numbers are all within the poll\u2019s margin of error. Fox News attributes the shift toward Biden to growing support among independent voters. One obvious limitation of the poll is that it spoke to registered voters rather than likely voters. The two groups aren\u2019t the same. As a result, the poll includes the views of respondents who won\u2019t be going to the polls, and hence, won\u2019t be directly deciding the election\u2019s outcome.\n\nThe Campaign Schedule\n\nThe first presidential debate is in six days (June 27, 2024).\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s sentencing hearing is in twenty days (July 11, 2024).\n\nThe Republican National Convention opens in Milwaukee in twenty-four days (July 15, 2024).\n\nThe Democratic National Convention opens in Chicago in fifty-nine days (August 19, 2024).\n\nThe second presidential debate is in eighty-one days (September 10, 2024)\n\nThe first in-person absentee voting in the nation begins in Minnesota and South Dakota in ninety-one days (September 20, 2024).\n\nElection Day is 137 days away.\n\nInauguration Day is 213 days away.\n\nShelby Sires assisted in the preparation of this post.\n\nThis publication is part of the Diamonstein-Spielvogel Project on the Future of Democracy.",

        "text": "Is The US Election an Investing Opportunity?\nA presidential election might cause short-term turbulence in the markets, creating discomfort for investors as they watch their portfolios churn or worry about the outcome.\n\nUnderstanding the impact elections have historically had on markets can serve as Pepto Bismol for investors with bad gut feelings, however.\n\nAre Democrats or Republicans Better for Stocks?\n\nLooking at 70 years of returns, a Democrat in the White House has been better for investors. Since 1953, $1,000 (\u00a3789.79) invested when a Democrat is president, sold to cash when a Republican takes office, then reinvested when a Democrat returns turns into $62,000. The opposite strategy \u2013 only investing when a Republican sits in the Oval Office \u2013 only grows to $27,000.\n\nReturns Since Eisenhower's 1953 Inauguration\n\n$1,000 invested in the S&P 500 based on the presidential party\n\nSource: Bespoke Investment Group, 1953-2023\n\nHowever, this overlooks critical context: investors would have been better off ignoring Washington DC entirely. The original $1,000 investment turns into nearly $1.7 million for those who never acted on their political preferences and remained invested throughout.\n\nReturns Since Eisenhower's 1953 Inauguration\n\nThe same process is repeated, with dramatically different results\n\nSource: Bespoke Investment Group, 1953-2023\n\nThe stock market goes up and down under every president, but the path of least resistance has always been higher. There's no reason to believe this will change because of November's election. In short, politics can be a significant drag on a portfolio. That's why treating the two like oil and water is essential. That's much easier said than done. And the next few months will be fertile ground for political implications on financial markets.\n\nPolitics Could Impact Dealmaking\n\nMajor policy differences cited between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump include healthcare spending, immigration, and business regulation. One interesting example is the regulatory landscape. Paramount Global (PARA), one of the most famous media brands, has been in the news for months because of its possible sale. After months of \"will they or won't they\" the company recently decided it was no longer for sale.\n\nParamount likely faced expensive and time-consuming litigation to realise this move. The Federal Trade Commission has been aggressively blocking mergers, preventing four in January this year alone. The prevailing theory is that Paramount wants to do the sale, but is better off waiting until after the election. A change in leadership could usher in a friendlier FTC, whose leadership is appointed by the president.\n\nBut theory is one thing; reality is something else entirely. We can pull examples from the last two presidencies in which conventional wisdom indicated one outcome, but something else happened.\n\nPresident Trump and China\n\nAfter Trump won in 2016, it was widely assumed his policies would have terrible consequences for companies with exposure to China. It could be argued that no American company does more business with China than Apple AAPL. A trade war would negatively impact its business. A few headlines at the time made this case:\n\nBut Apple's business performed just fine. Its stock returned nearly eight times the US stock market in the year after these articles were published.\n\nApple vs Market Returns, Sept 2019-Sept 2020\n\nSource: Morningstar Direct\n\nPresident Biden and Energy Companies\n\nTo borrow from Rodney Dangerfield in Caddyshack: \"keep it fair!\" There's a similar example from the Biden presidency. The administration is often viewed as an enemy of the energy industry. One specific agenda item was to make it harder for energy companies to drill by reducing permits.\n\nHeadlines included:\n\nBut like Apple, energy companies did just fine. The returns of energy stocks nearly doubled that of the US stock market over the next year.\n\nEnergy Sector vs Market Returns, Dec 2020-Dec 2021\n\nSource: Morningstar Direct\n\nIn fact, since Biden's inauguration in January 2021, energy has been the best-performing US equity sector. The technology sector, which is in second place, doesn't even come close to its returns.\n\nTotal Returns Since Biden Inauguration\n\nSource: Morningstar Direct, May 31 2024\n\nThese examples and others remind us that conventional wisdom can often be wrong, and that politics influence the stock market less than we might realise.\n\nResist Reacting to Election Volatility\n\nMonetary decisions are full of emotions, biases, and blind spots. There's no need to add another layer of complexity with politics. It's been said that life is 10% what happens and 90% is how people choose to react. The next few months will be a measuring stick.\n\nTo date, markets have been calm \u2013 maybe too calm. The CBOE Volatility Index touched its lowest level in five years last month.\n\nThe VIX Over Time\n\nSource: CBOE, January 2019-May 2024\n\nThe election could be a spark, as election years tend to observe more volatility than other years.\n\nThe Vix is Higher in Election Years\n\nSource: CBOE, January 2019-May 2024\n\nThere's the additional factor that the average year tends to observe a stock market decline of 14%. To date, the largest decline has only been 5%. It's fair to assume a decline of some variety could be on the horizon, but that's not unique to this moment. If it occurs, media coverage will likely prioritise sensationalism over calming long-term perspectives, potentially using politics as a convenient angle to fan more flames.\n\nJust remember, their fiduciary duty is not to you.",

        "text": "The day the Constitution was ratified\nOn June 21, 1788, the Constitution became the official framework of the government of the United States of America when New Hampshire became the ninth of 13 states to ratify it. The journey to ratification, however, was a long and arduous process.\n\nUntil the new Constitution was ratified, the country was governed by the Articles of Confederation. That document was tailored to a newly formed nation made of states acting more like independent, sovereign countries, and it quickly became clear to some of America\u2019s leaders that future stability required a stronger, more centralized government. New York\u2019s Alexander Hamilton thus led the call for a constitutional convention to reevaluate the nation\u2019s governing document. The Confederation Congress endorsed his initiative, and representatives from all 13 states were subsequently invited to convene in Philadelphia on May 25, 1787, to participate in the Convention.\n\nThe initial purpose of the Convention was for the delegates to amend the Articles of Confederation; however, the ultimate outcome was the proposal and creation of a completely new form of government. Three months later, on September 17, 1787, the Convention concluded with the signing (by 38 out of 41 delegates present) of the new U.S. Constitution. Under Article VII, it was agreed that the document would not be binding until its ratification by nine of the 13 existing states.\n\nHamilton and James Madison led the lobbying efforts for votes in favor of ratifying the Constitution. With assistance from John Jay, they produced the 85 essays known as \u201cThe Federalist Papers\u201d that explained and defended how the proposed new government would function. The essays were published in newspapers nationwide.\n\nThe first state to ratify the Constitution was Delaware on December 7, 1787, followed by Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Georgia, and Connecticut. Some states voiced opposition to the Constitution on the grounds that it did not provide protection for rights such as freedom of speech, religion, and press. However, the terms of the Massachusetts Compromise reached in February 1788 stipulated that amendments to that effect\u2014what became the Bill of Rights\u2014would be immediately proposed. The constitution was subsequently ratified by Massachusetts, Maryland, South Carolina, and, finally, New Hampshire.\n\nAfter ratification, Congress set dates for the first federal elections and the official implementation of the Constitution. Elections were set to take place from Monday, December 15, 1788, to Saturday, January 10, 1789, and the new government was set to begin on March 4, 1789.\n\nIn the nation\u2019s first presidential election, George Washington was elected President and John Adams was elected Vice President. Congress was also restructured to reflect the system of representation created by the Connecticut Compromise at the Constitutional Convention.\n\nThe Constitution, however, was still evolving. Madison introduced 17 amendments to the Constitution born from the Massachusetts Compromise, of which Congress adopted twelve on September 25, 1789, to send forth to the states for ratification. Ten of those amendments, known as the Bill of Rights, were ratified on December 15, 1791.\n\nEven after the Constitution\u2019s ratification, the U.S. did not begin to look and function remotely like it does today until several years later. The Constitution was not ratified by all states until May 29, 1790, when Rhode Island finally approved the document, and the Bill of Rights was not ratified to become part of the Constitution until the end of the following year. Moreover, the capital was not set until July 16, 1790, almost a year and half after the general elections took place.\n\nThe location of the capital was born, like most decisions in the formation of the budding nation, out of negotiation. Hamilton, now Secretary of the Treasury, sought passage of the Funding Act so that the federal government could assume state Revolutionary War debts and thus endow the government with more economic power. Meanwhile, Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson wanted to pass the Residence Act, which would set the location of the nation\u2019s capital along the Potomac River and give the South increased political power to check the North\u2019s growing economic power by placing the capital in a location friendly to Southern economic interests.\n\nThe two men struck a deal: Jefferson would persuade Madison, a man with significant influence in the House, to back Hamilton\u2019s Funding Act, thereby garnering him the votes it would need to pass. In return, Hamilton would help Jefferson and Madison secure the votes needed to pass the Residence Act. The capital\u2019s precise geographic location was left to President Washington, and on January 24, 1791\u2014almost three years after the Constitution was first ratified\u2014land was designated for construction.",

Since his presidency, rappers have had an elevated, if informal, platform in politics, making their own preferences for president known too.\n\nAnd in 2024, while notable rap artists lean towards President Biden, former President Donald Trump has also seen his support grow, too, especially among younger rappers.\n\nOn Tuesday, Vice President Kamala Harris joined rapper Quavo, of the \"Migos,\" in Atlanta for a summit centered around gun violence prevention. Last Saturday, Detroit rapper Sada Baby was outside the 180 Church in Detroit, encouraging people to vote for Trump.\n\nFile: Vice President Kamala Harris speaks with rapper Quavo at the Rocket Foundation Summit on gun violence prevention at the Carter Center on June 18, 2024 in Atlanta. ELIJAH NOUVELAGE/AFP via Getty Images\n\nTrump and the rappers who back him\n\nSome of the rappers supporting Trump have cult, regional followings, while others are charting on Billboard. They cite a variety of reasons for backing Trump: COVID-19 era stimulus checks, the Payment Protection Program, his pardons of rappers and a dissonance in the current political system.\n\nIn 2020, Trump pardoned both Lil Wayne and Kodak Black on his way out of the White House in 2021. Kodak Black is among those in the \"Black Americans for Trump'' coalition this cycle.\n\nFile: Donald Trump is endorced by rappers Sheff G and Sleepy Hallow Speaks at a campaign event at Crotona Park in the South Bronx on Thursday, May 23, 2024. in New York City.

Both were indicted on murder conspiracy charges in May 2023.\n\nFile: Rapper Sada Baby performs onstage during the WJLB Big Holiday Show at Little Caesars Arena on December 17, 2021 in Detroit. Aaron J.

I feel like our votes should be worked for, I feel like our parents blindly voted for generations, but I think this generation is now understanding that we have to ask questions,\" Vezzo, who said he's leaning towards Mr. Trump for his vote, told Fox News.\n\nSt. Louis rapper Sexyy Red, who has two singles on Billboard's \"Hot 100\" chart, cited COVID-19 stimulus checks as part of why she supports the former president.\n\n\"Once he started getting Black people out of jail and giving people that free money. Aww baby, we love Trump\u2026 We need him back because, baby, them checks,\" she said on a podcast with comedian Theo Von in October 2023.\n\nMr. Trump's past campaigns have involved rappers \u2014 one of his closing rallies in Michigan before the 2020 election featured Florida rapper Lil Pump, who Trump mistakenly called \"Lil Pimp.\" Ice Cube was an adviser in 2020 to Trump on a proposal to help Black Americans.\n\nAnd while controversial rapper Kanye West ran his own tumultuous third-party 2020 presidential campaign to challenge Trump \u2013 the former president dined with West and white nationalist Nick Fuentes in 2022, and the two have known each other for years. West endorsed Mr. Trump in February.\n\nFile: Rapper Kanye West, left, shakes hands with U.S. President Donald Trump during a meeting in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Thursday, Oct. 11, 2018. Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nJaniyah Thomas, the Trump campaign's Black media director, said Trump is meeting with rappers, pastors, and business leaders and argued his engagement with rappers is \"completely organic.\"\n\n\"His message resonates with these artists and their audiences, largely in Black communities, who feel ripped off by Joe Biden's terrible economic and immigration policies,\" Thomas added.\n\nIn response to Trump's pursuit of support from rappers, Biden campaign senior spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said Trump has \"spent his life and political career disrespecting Black communities every chance he gets.\"\n\n\"It's why the first thing he did after taking over the RNC was shut down its minority outreach centers, and it's why his campaign keeps staging their so-called 'outreach' in white neighborhoods and in front of white audiences,\" she added. \"Our campaign is on the ground engaging with our communities on the issues that matter.\"\n\nTrump's past support from rap artists didn't translate into decisive electoral gains among Black or younger voters \u2013 often Democratic leaning groups \u2013 who make up the bulk of rap listeners according to a CBS News 2022 poll.\n\nAccording to CBS News exit polls, Trump won 8% Black support in 2016 and 12% in 2020. Among younger voters, those between 18 and 29 years old, 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton (55%) and Mr. Biden (60%) still captured a majority of their support.\n\nBiden campaign leans into music festival canvassing, Black outreach events\n\nBut polls this year also show Biden's support among Black and younger voters slightly softening. The Biden campaign has responded with record investments of money and time in voter outreach.\n\nNew York City rapper Fat Joe, an advocate for affordable healthcare, took part in a March panel with Harris about decriminalizing marijuana. Queen Latifah and Lizzo performed at a New York City fundraiser for the campaign in March. Singer John Legend, whose catalog features frequent collaborations with rappers, is backing Mr. Biden for a second time and called Trump a \"dyed-in-the-wool racist\" in an MSNBC interview.\n\nFile: President Joe Biden and Queen Latifah at the The Kennedy Center Honorees reception at The White House on December 03, 2023 in Washington, DC. Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images / Getty Images\n\nThe Biden campaign notes it's been active in not just courting rappers' endorsements, but their audiences as well.\n\nThe Biden campaign told CBS News it will have a presence at the \"Essence Festival of Culture,\" the largest Black culture and music event in the U.S., and have paid media partnerships and meetings planned with Black celebrities and musicians at the upcoming BET awards in Los Angeles.\n\nThe campaign also had canvassers at the April \"Dreamville Fest\" in Raleigh, North Carolina, put on by Grammy-nominated rapper J Cole, and had plans for R&B singer Usher's \"Lovers & Friends\" festival in Las Vegas in May, though the festival was canceled due to weather.\n\n\"The Democratic party has been very intentional and consistent about their outreach and engagement [with Black voters],\" said Democratic strategist Antjuan Seawright. \"I recognize that certainly there's more work to do because when you are the most decisive and loyal [voting] bloc\u2013 the biggest room in the house is the room for improvement.\"\n\nIn 2020, Mr. Biden was backed by Offset, another Migos member, and Chicago rapper Common, who performed at an Atlanta campaign rally. Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny also voiced campaign ads targeting Latino voters in Florida, Arizona and Pennsylvania.\n\nSkepticism about impact of Trump's popularity with rappers\n\nPolitical strategists, and political science professors who study rap music don't believe either candidate's support from artists will shift the race in a meaningful way.\n\n\"We're not monolithic in any way shape or form,\" Seawright said of Black voters. \"I don't think you'll see some mass sprint to Donald Trump because you have a few artists who show up with him or make an appearance.\"\n\nCorey Miles, a Tulane University sociology professor who studies the intersection of trap music, a rap subgenre created in the south, and incarceration, said Trump has \"always had a connection in the Black imagination,\" primarily from his days as a celebrity businessman.\n\n\"I don't think it's any different than what we've kind of always seen Black people do in terms of our diversity [in voting]. I just think Trump is such a sensationalist person, that when Black folks support him, it feels different or more of an outlier than it actually is,\" Miles said.\n\nDuring a February speech at the Black Conservative Freedom Gala in Columbia, S.C., Trump suggested Black voters support him because they view him as \"being discriminated against\" following his indictments. \"They see what's happening to me happens to them,\" he added.\n\nFollowing the release of his Atlanta mugshot in August 2023, rapper Chief Keef posted a photoshopped picture of Trump throwing up gang signs and wrote, \"I know whatever deck he on[,] he good in the hood for sure[.] he finna run the prison.\"\n\nA majority, 85%, of Black voters surveyed in a June CBS News poll believed Trump received a fair trail in his hush money payments case. A majority also considered it \"very serious\" and a \"major factor\" in their vote.\n\n\"What's crazy to me is from the beginning of time, America has always told how to treat a convicted felon. Now that he's a convicted felon you want the rules to change,\" Florida artist Plies, a frequent critic of Mr. Trump, said on his song \"Convicted Felon.\"\n\nTricia Rose, a Director of the Center for the Study of Race and Ethnicity in America at Brown University who has authored books about rap history and race, said Trump has \"manipulated that ID of what Black felony status means for his own purposes.\"\n\nRose noted some of Trump's disparaging comments about crime in predominantly Black cities and his call for the death penalty of the \"Central Park 5,\" five minority teenagers wrongfully convicted of raping a woman in 1989.\n\n\"What he's done is using kind of grotesque imagery \u2014 gold sneakers and so on \u2014 to create a relationship to a constituency that he's been brutal about,\" Rose said, referencing the Trump campaign's sale of limited edition gold sneakers.\n\n\"It's a very shrewd manipulation, that hopefully other young MCs who have a different understanding, perhaps a broader understanding, can jump in and challenge this,\" she added.\n\nThe undecided and those to left of Biden\n\nOther rappers remain undecided. 50 Cent, who was on Capitol Hill to talk about Black entrepreneurship, told CBS News he's unsure who he'll vote for this time. He switched his support from Trump to Biden in 2020.\n\nCardi B, who backed Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in 2020 and Mr. Biden in the general election, said she won't vote at all due to disappointment with the economy.\n\nSome artists have also been outspoken about the Biden administration's response to Israeli strikes in Gaza. Macklemore's pro-Gaza single, \"Hind's Hall,\" where he explicitly states he will not vote for Mr. Biden, has become an unofficial anthem for pro-Palestinian protests.\n\nBiden administration officials have supported sending more military aid to Israel, but has also been working towards a ceasefire in Gaza.\n\n\"The blood is on your hands, Biden, we can see it all. And **k no, I'm not votin' for you in the fall,\" Macklemore raps.\n\nTaurean Small and Shawna Mizelle contributed reporting to this story.",

        "text": "Could Zarif tilt Iran's election toward long shot Reformist Pezeshkian?\nZarif back in the arena\n\nIran\u2019s sole reformist candidate for president, lawmaker Masoud Pezeshkian, has shaken up the race by enlisting former Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif as his foreign policy adviser.\n\nZarif, who served as foreign minister under President Hassan Rouhani (2013-2021), was the architect of the Iran nuclear deal, which was cheered by Iranians when signed in 2015.\n\nIran\u2019s economy surged the next three years, until US President Donald Trump withdrew from the accord in 2018 and imposed even tougher sanctions on Iran.\n\nMany Iranians nonetheless may look back with some nostalgia at the Rouhani era, when the Iranian economy began to bounce back as a result of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the official name of the nuclear deal, and when Zarif\u2019s role on the world stage opened a door to the West.\n\nZarif, seated next to Pezeshkian on a TV panel last week, made an impassioned case for the positive economic impact of the nuclear deal. The numbers are on Zarif\u2019s side \u2014 Iran\u2019s economy was better then than now.\n\n\u201cZarif remains very popular, and his role in the campaign could unsettle the establishment,\u201d said Al-Monitor contributor Ali Hashem, who was recently in Iran.\n\nIt\u2019s already happening. The other five presidential candidates and the conservative press have now made Rouhani and Zarif, as well as Pezeshkian, the targets of attacks.\n\nA message to the United States and the West\n\nPezeshkian says diplomacy is the best path for sanctions relief and economic progress. By enlisting Zarif, he is sending a signal to the United States and the West, as well as to Iranians, about a possible change of course in Iranian foreign policy if he wins.\n\n\u201cWhen you think of Zarif, you think of dialogue with the United States,\u201d said Hashem.\n\nDealing with the United States, and maybe even US President Donald Trump, looms over the election, said Vali Nasr, a professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies, in this week\u2019s On the Middle East podcast with Amberin Zaman.\n\nIranians and many others in the region are already planning for a Trump win, said Nasr. A second Trump administration could mean a new push for maximum pressure or the art of the deal \u2014 or both.\n\nIran\u2019s potential for a nuclear weapons breakout remains a top priority for Washington no matter who wins the US presidential election on Nov. 5. Reports this week indicate that Iran has expanded production of highly enriched uranium production at two of its nuclear plants, shortening the timeline needed to roll out a nuclear weapon if it makes the decision to do so.\n\nAnd, as Nasr points out, if Trump ends Russia\u2019s war with Ukraine, as he has said he would do, this would be a game changer in global politics with consequences for Iran, which has deepened its military and economic ties with Russia since the war.\n\nReformists all in on Pezeshkian\n\nThe establishment and the hard-line Guardian Council, which vets candidates, may not have anticipated the possible impact of Zarif coming off the bench for Pezeshkian.\n\nPezeshkian, a low-key heart surgeon, was likely envisioned to slightly boost interest and turnout, not to rally the reformists and maybe split the conservative vote \u2014 a solid 20% or so of the electorate \u2014 among the other five candidates.\n\n\u201cThe council's recurrent purge of heavyweight moderate politicians has been interpreted as an attempt by the hard-line-controlled establishment to choreograph victory for its favored candidates,\u201d wrote our correspondent from Tehran. \u201cCritics have also argued that the move to allow only one reformist candidate (with limited charisma) to enter the race has been meant merely to lift voter participation following record-low turnouts in the past two.\u201d\n\nThe current election was called after the deaths of President Ebrahim Raisi (2021-2024) and other officials in a helicopter crash on May 19, 2024.\n\nRaisi\u2019s election three years ago was met with apathy and quiet disgust among many Iranians, especially those under 30, who make up 60% of its population of 90 million. Only 49% of Iranians voted in the 2021 election in the lowest turnout ever. The second-largest vote-getter after Raisi was blank or invalid ballots, a reflection of widespread malaise and discontent.\n\nRaisi\u2019s election as president in 2021 signaled the dominance of the principlists, as the conservative camp is known. After Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal in 2018, conservatives pilloried Rouhani, Zarif and reformists for a catastrophic (in their score) and humiliating foreign policy failure. The reformists have suffered a three-year losing streak in parliament, now controlled by the principlists, aided of course by the Guardian Council. Zarif exited the stage for a mostly off-the-radar professorship at Tehran University.\n\nRaisi gave priority to strengthening ties with Russia, China and the Gulf states, including restoring relations with Saudi Arabia, while tensions with the United States and Israel escalated in Iraq, Lebanon and Gaza.\n\nAt home, Raisi\u2019s administration was dogged by sanctions, a failing economy, increased corruption, poor government services and crackdown on dissent. The death in custody of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in September 2022 for a hijab violation sparked widespread anti-government protests. Raisi\u2019s government gave no ground on reform and imprisoned and killed many protesters.\n\nIf the candidates are asking whether you were better off under Rouhani or \"the martyr Raisi,\" as he is referred to, they may not like the answer. The status quo is not a winning hand, and they all seem to know it.\n\nA history of surprise\n\nIran\u2019s presidential elections have a tendency to surprise.\n\nIn 1997, reformist candidate Mohammad Khatami won an upset landslide with 69% of the vote over parliament speaker Ali Akbar Nategh-Nouri (25%).\n\nIn 2005, the populist Mahmoud Ahmadinejad upset Akbar Rafsanjani, former president and chairman of the powerful Expediency Discernment Council, 63% to 37%.\n\nMore on Iran",

        "text": "Who is Donald Trump's reclusive new mega-donor, Timothy Mellon?\nWho is Trump's new mega-donor, Timothy Mellon?\n\nGetty Images Timothy Mellon has donated both to RFK Jr and Donald Trump in the 2024 electoral cycle.\n\nAn octogenarian billionaire scion of one of America's wealthiest families has emerged as a major figure backing Donald Trump's 2024 election campaign. With a $50m (\u00a339.5m) donation made on 31 May, 81-year-old Timothy Mellon has become the largest donor to the former president so far during this electoral cycle. Mr Mellon, the heir to the Pittsburgh-based Mellon banking family, also has been the biggest donor to independent candidate Robert F Kennedy's campaign. The BBC has contacted Mr Mellon for comment about his political donations. Known as a recluse, the Wyoming-based Mr Mellon avoids the spotlight and social circles of other US billionaires. Here's what we know.\n\nGetty Images Mr Mellon's grandfather Andrew was treasury secretary between between 1921 and 1932\n\nWho is Timothy Mellon?\n\nAccording to Forbes magazine, Mr Mellon is a descendant of Thomas Mellon, an Irish immigrant who amassed a fortune in real estate and banking after arriving in the US in 1818. The Mellon family - which also included Mr Mellon's grandfather Andrew, a former US treasury secretary - is today worth over $14bn (\u00a311bn). Forbes estimates that the Mellons are the 34th richest family in the US. Born in 1942, Mr Mellon attended Yale University where he studied city planning. His father was a major donor at the school and provided the funding to establish the Yale Center for British Art - the largest collection of British art outside the United Kingdom. In 1981, Mr Mellon formed Guilford Transportation Industries, a holding company named after his hometown of Guilford, Connecticut. It quickly bought up three major railways that stretched from Canada, through New England and into the mid-Atlantic region of the US. The firm, which had maintained its chief focus on railroads, pivoted in 1998 when it bought the brand of the famed - but long bankrupt - Pan American World Airways. Perhaps influencing the purchase, Mr Mellon had developed a love for flying around this time - logging more than 11,500 hours in the cockpit. \"As owner of the company [Pan Am] and with the skill necessary to do the job, he became a commercial pilot and quite literally kept the American institution that is Pan Am flying,\" reads a synopsis for an upcoming autobiography due to be published in 2025. Through much of this, he served as trustee of the Andew W. Mellon Foundation, stepping down in 2002 after 21 years. Three years later, in 2005, Mr Mellon left his native Connecticut for Wyoming. He has lived there since, avoiding the spotlight and only rarely speaking to the media.\n\nMellon's political views\n\nEven before his recent donation to the Trump campaign, Mr Mellon has a history of donating to conservative candidates and causes. In 2010, Mr Mellon donated about $1.5m to the state of Arizona to defray the legal costs to defend SB 1070, a controversial anti-immigration bill. More recently, Mr Mellon helped bankroll Texas Governor Greg Abbott's construction of a wall along the Mexican border, providing more than $53m for the project in 2021. He also has given money to various Republican-aligned super PACS - or \"political action committees\" - to support conservative candidates. Mr Mellon highlighted some of his political views when he wrote a self-published 2015 memoir. In it, he condemned what he termed \"Slavery Redux\" social safety net programmes. Mr Mellon also wrote that black voters were awarded \"freebies\" in exchange for \"delivering votes\". He claimed this \"largess\" is \"funded by the hardworking folks...who are too honest or too proud to allow themselves to sink into this morass\". In exchange, he claimed, black Americans became \"more belligerent\" and \"slaves of a new master, Uncle Sam\". Mr Mellon, however, has occasionally made small donations to Democrats, including $2,700 for progressive New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's 2018 campaign. He told Bloomberg News in 2020 that she tried to return the donation, but that he refused to cash the cheque. Mr Mellon also expressed admiration for Trump during that rare interview, telling Bloomberg that \"he's done the things he promised to, or tried to do the things he's promised to\". Trump's most notable achievement, according to Mr Mellon, was \"in trade and righting the balance between our country and the rest of the world, especially China\".\n\nMellon's quest for Amelia Earhart",

        "text": "Trump campaign gets $50m boost from single donor\nDonald Trump's presidential campaign has received $50m (\u00a339.5m) boost from the conservative billionaire Timothy Mellon, a federal filing showed on Thursday.\n\nThe Super-Pac fund called \"MAGA Inc\" disclosed to the Federal Election Commission that it took in more than $68m from donors last month.\n\nReuters reported that Mr Mellon, an heir of the Pittsburgh-based Mellon banking family, gave $50m. Another $10m came from billionaires Liz and Dick Uihlein.\n\nUS media reported that Mr Mellon sent the donation the day after Trump was convicted on 34 charges of falsifying business records in his New York hush-money trial.\n\nMr Mellon has also been the biggest donor to independent presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr, giving the pro-Kennedy Super-Pac American Values at least $20m.\n\nSuper-Pacs are independent \"political action committees\" that can raise unlimited amounts of money to support an election candidate.\n\nThe Mellon donation has helped pro-Trump allies outspend US President Joe Biden's allies on campaigning in recent weeks.\n\nMr Mellon, who lives in Wyoming and is rarely photographed, is an amateur pilot who has invested in and led transport-related companies.\n\nForbes estimates that the Mellon family is worth around $14.1bn.\n\nMeanwhile, Reuters reported that billionaire Mike Bloomberg has given nearly $20m to Biden-supporting Super-Pacs.\n\nMr Bloomberg's contribution included $19m to an independent pro-Biden group known as Future Forward or FF PAC.\n\nA further $900,000 was given to the Biden Victory Fund, which is an amalgamation of the Biden campaign and Democratic Party committees.\n\nThe Biden campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nOn Thursday, the pro-Kennedy Super-Pac reported that it took in only around $280,000 last month, with none of it coming from Mr Mellon.",

        "text": "How much do Americans know about the 2024 presidential election?\nThe 2024 presidential election is fast approaching, but are Americans paying attention yet? A new YouGov poll asked Americans whether they are following the election and measured how much they know about the current state of the race. Most Americans (63%) read or hear news about the election at least weekly, but only 35% actively seek out election news. Americans are more likely than not to know that someone has unofficially won each of the major-party presidential nominations, but they are less sure whether the Democratic vice presidential candidate has (33%) or has not (38%) been announced (she has). Most Americans (86%) know that Donald Trump has been on trial for a crime in 2024, but 25% incorrectly thought he had already been convicted of a crime \u2014 according to a poll conducted weeks before he was. How much do Americans know about the election? Most Americans (61%) know that the Republican Party controls the House of Representatives, and a similar proportion (60%) know that the Democratic Party controls the Senate. For each chamber, about 40% of Americans either think it is controlled by the opposite party or are unsure which party controls it. For example, 20% of Americans are unsure which party controls the House, and 19% think the Democrats control the House. Americans with college degrees are more likely than those without one to correctly identify which party controls each chamber. 72% of Americans with college degrees know that Democrats control the Senate, compared to 54% of those without college degrees. The knowledge gap about control of the House is about as large between Americans with and without college degrees.\n\nMost Americans (54%) know that someone has unofficially won the Republican nomination for president, and 51% know that someone has unofficially won the Democratic nomination. For each party, about 20% of Americans do not think the party has unofficially selected nominees; others named someone else or said they were unsure. Large majorities of Americans who know that each party has unofficial nominees correctly identify Donald Trump (82%) and Joe Biden (84%) as those nominees. Americans are more certain about the 2024 Republican vice presidential candidate. Most (66%) know that the 2024 Republican vice presidential candidate has not been selected yet, and only 8% think the party already has chosen one. On the other hand, few Americans correctly say that the 2024 Democratic vice presidential candidate has been announced (33%), and 38% of Americans do not think the Democrats have announced their vice presidential candidate yet. Most Americans who think the Democrats have selected a vice presidential nominee correctly name Vice President Kamala Harris as the nominee (88%). Only 55% of Americans know that the Democratic National Convention has not happened yet, and the same proportion know that the Republican National Election has not happened. In each case, about 40% of Americans don\u2019t know whether the convention has happened yet.\n\nMost Americans (86%) know that Trump has been on trial for a crime in 2024. But 25% of Americans incorrectly thought Trump had been convicted of a crime in 2024 weeks before he was. Democrats (31%) and Independents (30%) were much more likely than Republicans (15%) to think Trump had been convicted of a crime before his actual conviction. Most Americans (54%) correctly think that Trump has been impeached, while 31% do not think he has ever been impeached. (Part of this low figure may be due to how impeachment is defined: Trump was impeached twice by the House but was not convicted either time by the Senate). Democrats (64%) are more likely than Independents (51%) and Republicans (47%) to know Trump has been impeached. Majorities of Americans know that Biden has not been on trial for a crime in 2024 (84%), has never been impeached (86%), and has not been convicted of a crime in 2024 (84%). Independents are more likely than Democrats and Republicans to be unsure about these questions. For example, 18% of Independents are not sure whether Biden has ever been impeached, compared to 7% of Democrats and 8% of Republicans.\n\nDespite their uncertainty about whether Trump has been convicted of a crime and about the current Democratic vice presidential nominee, Americans have a good idea of the policies supported by Democrats and Republicans. Majorities of Americans know that the Democratic Party is more supportive than the Republican Party of expanding government-subsidized health care (72%), strengthening gun control laws (72%), and using regulation to address climate change (71%). 57% know all three. Also, majorities know that the Republican Party is more supportive of making immigration controls strict (74%) and increasing restrictions on abortion (73%). 64% know both. There is more uncertainty around party positions on cutting taxes. Most Americans see the Republican Party as more supportive of tax cuts (54%), but 22% see the Democrat Party as more supportive.\n\nAre Americans following the election? 31% of Americans are paying \u201ca lot\u201d of attention to the 2024 presidential election, and another 32% are paying \u201csome\u201d attention to it. 13% are not paying any attention to the election. A slim majority (54%) care \u201ca great deal\u201d about who wins the 2024 presidential election, while only 6% do not care at all about who wins. Most Americans read or hear news about the 2024 presidential election daily (36%) or weekly (28%). Another 10% engage with election news once or twice a month, while 22% read or hear election news less than that or never. Republicans (43%) are more likely than Democrats (34%) and Independents (31%) to see election news daily. Americans are less likely to discuss the election than they are to hear news about it. Only 12% discuss the election with friends or family daily, while 26% do so weekly. 22% of Americans discuss the election less than once or twice a month and 18% never discuss it. Like with news consumption, Republicans (48%) are more likely than Democrats (36%) and Independents (31%) to discuss the election daily or weekly.\n\nWhen it comes to news about the election, about one-third of Americans (35%) actively seek it out, while 16% actively avoid it. Half of Americans (49%) do neither. Older Americans are more likely than younger Americans to actively seek out election news: 49% of Americans 65 and older actively seek out election news, compared to only 24% of adults under 30. Americans 65 and older also are much less likely than younger adults to avoid election news. Adults under 30 are more likely than other age groups to neither seek out nor avoid election news.\n\nAbout half of Americans (49%) have consumed election-related news from television in the last month, while 46% have gotten election news from social media and 37% have gotten it from friends, family, or colleagues. News websites (34%) and apps (33%) are also popular sources of election information. Adults under 30 are more likely than older Americans to get election news from social media. On the other hand, one-quarter (25%) of Americans 65 and older have gotten election news from print newspapers or magazines in the last month, compared to about 10% in other age groups.",

        "text": "What can polls tell us in 2024?\nIf there is one thing Americans can count on during any presidential election year, it\u2019s the constant commentary about polls. But how has polling changed in the digital age? How accurately can polls predict election outcomes? What purpose do they serve?\n\nJohn Lapinski, the Robert A. Fox Leadership Professor of Political Science and director of the Robert A. Fox Leadership Program and the Penn Program on Opinion Research and Election Studies (PORES), addresses these questions. Lapinski also directs the Elections Unit at NBC News, where he is responsible for projecting races for the network and producing election-related stories through exit polls.\n\n\u201cThere have been misses with polling recently,\u201d Lapinski admits. \u201cIs it critically important that people have a sense of who may or may not win an election before election night? I don\u2019t think so, but it is important, given that we live in an electoral democracy, that we have some way of measuring public opinion; otherwise, the people elected to represent us won\u2019t know what we want.\u201d\n\nLapinski notes that polling has changed dramatically over the decades. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen big differences in response rates when using online methods versus telephone. There are differences in subgroups within a population, and it\u2019s very pronounced with younger people,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing a huge experiment right now at PORES, running five different surveys, including telephone interviews with both landline and cellphone interviews, a text survey, and two different online methods.\u201d\n\nIn general, Lapinski says, polls can\u2019t predict turnout. However, \u201cone of the beautiful aspects of election polls is that you can determine whether they\u2019re accurate or not because elections happen. Here\u2019s what the poll said, here\u2019s what the results said.\u201d\n\nThis year\u2019s election, he adds, will be \u201csuper close.\u201d\n\nThis story is by Jane Carroll.

        "text": "Russia-Linked CopyCop Expands to Cover US Elections, Target Political Leaders\nInsikt Group's report reveals that CopyCop, a likely Russian government-aligned influence network, has shifted its focus to the 2024 US elections. Using AI and inauthentic websites, CopyCop creates and spreads political content. The network registered 120 new websites between May 10 and May 12, 2024, amplifying targeted content through platforms like YouTube. Despite a focus shift to US elections, CopyCop's AI-generated content has seen limited social media amplification.\n\nRussia-Linked CopyCop Expands to Cover US Elections, Target Political Leaders\n\nOn May 9, 2024, Insikt Group published an initial report on CopyCop, a likely Russian government-aligned influence network. CopyCop uses inauthentic websites and generative artificial intelligence (AI) to create and spread political content. Between May 10 and May 12, 2024, the network registered 120 new websites using similar tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). CopyCop has shifted its focus primarily to the 2024 United States (US) presidential election, disseminating targeted content through YouTube videos aimed at political leaders in France, Ukraine, and the European Union (EU).\n\nCopyCop has expanded its sources for influence content to include mainstream news outlets in the US and UK, conservative-leaning US media, and Russian state-affiliated media. Within 24 hours of the original articles being posted, CopyCop scrapes, modifies, and disseminates them to US election-themed websites using over 1,000 fake journalist personas. Despite the rapid content generation, the AI-generated content has seen limited amplification on social media.\n\nThe network has adapted to recent scrutiny by moving its infrastructure to US-based hosts, likely to minimize Russian government connections. Additionally, fewer traces of generative AI use indicate an attempt to obscure the use of large language models (LLMs).\n\nKey Findings\n\nCopyCop now targets the 2024 US elections, reducing content on other topics like Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine and domestic politics in France and the UK.\n\nCopyCop registered 120 new websites between May 10 and May 12, 2024, focusing on US elections.\n\nThe network uses AI-generated content and fake journalist personas to spread modified articles from mainstream and conservative-leaning US media, as well as Russian state-affiliated outlets.\n\nNew French-themed and US election websites are publishing targeted, likely human-crafted content.\n\nAs of early June 2024, CopyCop's new AI-generated content has seen little to no amplification on social media.\n\nOver 1,000 distinct author profiles and LLM-generated text in article headlines indicate extensive use of AI.\n\nMitigations\n\nUse Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud to track and summarize emerging narratives across CopyCop websites.\n\nMonitor the spread of CopyCop content on social media and messaging platforms like Telegram.\n\nNews organizations should track and counteract plagiarized content to safeguard their reputation.\n\nUtilize Recorded Future Brand Intelligence to identify and address typosquatting domains and infringing content.\n\nInfluence networks using generative AI, like CopyCop, are likely to become more prominent ahead of the 2024 US elections, although they may not gain significant attention initially. Amplification of CopyCop content by existing influence networks is helping bring its content to existing audiences. Once these websites have established persistence, CopyCop will likely publish more targeted content hidden among the high volume of AI-generated content, making them harder to identify and parse out. To mitigate the impact, public organizations, news entities, and AI providers should proactively enforce sanctions, intellectual property laws, and terms of service before these networks gain traction and influence.\n\nTo read the entire analysis, click here to download the report as a PDF.",

        "text": "America's new generation gap: Young voters say they'll inherit a more challenging world. But will they vote in it?\nCBS News poll: Young voters say they'll inherit a more challenging world. But will they vote?\n\nIt's actually not all ok, Boomers \u2014 at least not in the eyes of America's youngest voters.\n\nMany under 30 believe their elders are leaving them a more dangerous world, with a worse environment and less opportunity.\n\nThese young voters are a more diverse group than older generations and in contrast to America's oldest voters, they think politics would be better with more of that diversity, too.\n\nThey've already faced challenges. They were disrupted by COVID: the youngest of them were in high school or college during the lockdowns and now say their education was interrupted by it. And to a far greater degree than older generations, many also look back and describe growing up with concerns of gun violence.\n\nToday, they overwhelmingly feel it's become harder to buy a house (current interest rates would suggest they're right), to raise a family, to get what they consider to be a good job (this, despite the strong national jobs numbers) or to start a business than it was for generations before them.\n\nBut most do remain hopeful about reaching the American Dream some day, and they're making their own path en route: Today, they describe their generation as \"creative,\" followed by words like \"innovative\" and \"diverse\" \u2014 all qualities most think will help them eventually change the world.\n\nTheir focus is on different issues from their elders' too, with more on climate, abortion and promoting that diversity.\n\nYet for all those concerns \u2014 or maybe because of them \u2014 they aren't planning to vote as much as their elders. They're thinking less about the election right now, and fewer of them say they'll definitely vote than their older counterparts.\n\nSo the extent to which they do or don't participate in '24 could be the most immediate way they'll shape the future for us all.\n\nOn diversity\n\nMajorities of voters under thirty think politics would be better with more diversity: More minorities, more women in office and (perhaps unsurprisingly) more young people.\n\nThere are big differences comparing these views to those over 65, far fewer of whom think politics would be better with that diversity \u2014 and who grew up in a very different and less diverse America.\n\nHow age of the candidates factors in the campaign\n\nTalking about young voters sets up a natural contrast with the age of this year's candidates \u2014 which for some of these young voters marks a fifty-year or greater gap in ages \u2014 and how that affects their views.\n\nHalf of these younger voters feel the candidates' respective ages \u2014 President Biden and former President Donald Trump's \u2014 make them out of touch.\n\nHalf of them say neither presidential candidate understands younger people \u2026 and most importantly, when they feel that, they're relatively less likely to want to vote.\n\nThe big question: Turnout\n\nThey have critiques and issues, but will they show up? The answer, at least on their stated intent from here, is not as much as their elders.\n\nIn fact, among those who did vote in 2020, only three-quarters say they'll definitely do so again this time.\n\nThat's a higher churn rate than for other age groups.\n\nHistorically, younger voters don't vote as much as older voters do, so that's not unique to this younger generation now \u2014 it's often about people's life stage, putting down roots in a community, developing habits of voting, getting involved or just having more time to follow politics as one gets older.\n\nThat said, just one in five young people feel their generation has a lot of say in the political process \u2014 even while at the same time, many of them aren't likely to vote.\n\nJust a third are thinking a lot about the presidential race right now.\n\nWhen asked for the reasons why they won't vote, responses include that it doesn't appeal to them, they don't have time or that the whole system is bad.\n\nYoung people are more disappointed with their choices in this race than the oldest age groups are.\n\nBut here's another difference. Older voters will vote regardless of whether they're satisfied with the candidate choice; they do so out of a sense of long-standing habit, party allegiance or duty.\n\nBut for younger voters, a lot of whom aren't satisfied with the choices they have, candidate satisfaction matters more. When they aren't satisfied with the candidates, they aren't as apt to show up.\n\nA wider range of issues that matter\n\nFor voters under 30, the economy is a major factor in their vote, as it is for all voters, but they're more likely to also include other issues in their calculus, such as abortion, climate, and issues of race and diversity \u2014 all of which accrue to a Biden vote.\n\nTheir percentage support today is not much different from 2020 either, though the turnout factor looms for their impact on Mr. Biden. Right now, young Democrats express comparably less likelihood of turning out than young Republicans.\n\nBy comparison, issues that Trump does well on with older voters \u2014 crime, immigration \u2014 are comparably less important to younger people.\n\n(We should note, they're voting for Mr. Biden when they say diversity is a top issue, but a substantial portion of them still think he hasn't gone far enough promoting it, so it's not that they're completely satisfied with the president.)\n\nEconomy, opportunity and the American dream\n\nViews of today's economy for them seem connected to ideas of opportunity, not just day-to-day finances.\n\nWhen young people think they can attain the American Dream (as most of them do, despite all their perceived challenges) they're relatively more likely to call today's economy good. When they can't see getting the Dream, they say the economy today is bad.\n\n(Notable for larger context, too: young people, still full of optimism, mostly think they can reach the American Dream, and most older voters over 65 think they have; it's actually people in between, in their prime working years today, who are most pessimistic about reaching it.)\n\nGuns\n\nMost say they grew up concerned about the possibility of gun violence when they were in school, a level of concern far higher than older voters express looking back.\n\nThat seems to impact their stances on gun policy. A majority support stricter laws covering the sale of guns, and that support is even higher among those who grew up concerned about gun violence.\n\nStudent loans\n\nAnd they're big fans of canceling student loan debt. (Biden gets big backing from those who do.)\n\nBut is it a motivator on its own? That's less clear. Those who approve of it are no more likely to say they'll turn out than people in the age group, overall.\n\nWar\n\nDespite the attention over recent months and protests on college campuses, for the wider under-30 group, the war between Israel and Hamas ranks well below the economy, abortion, and many other issue factors.\n\nHowever, they do feel very differently about it than older Americans, with relatively more of them calling for a stop to Israel's military action.\n\nClimate\n\nThey're more likely to say climate change needs action now.\n\nAbortion\n\nIf the Biden camp wants to motivate turnout along abortion lines, they may have some work to do:\n\nMost younger voters want abortion to be legal \u2014 as do most voters overall \u2014 but they're less likely than older Americans to think Biden would try to pass a national law legalizing it, and more likely than their elders to be unsure what he'd do.\n\nThey're also more apt to think Trump would do nothing, or to be unsure what Trump would do.\n\nThis CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,460 U.S. adults interviewed between June 17-21, 2024. The survey included an oversample of adults age 18-29 for a total of 743 adults in that age group. The final sample as reported was weighted to be representative of adults nationwide according to gender, age, race, and education based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as to 2020 presidential vote. The margin of error for the total sample is \u00b12.8 points. The margin of error for the sample of adults 18-29 is \u00b15.2 points.",

Proponents say the forum\u2019s small and relatively homogenous membership promotes collective decision-making, but critics note that it often lacks follow-through and excludes emerging powers.\n\nRussia belonged to the forum from 1998 through 2014, when the bloc was known as the Group of Eight (G8), but the country was suspended following its annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimea region. The G7\u2019s future has recently been challenged by continued tensions with Russia and, increasingly, China, as well as by internal disagreements over trade and climate policies. But responding to Moscow and Beijing has also brought the bloc together. In a sign of renewed cooperation, the G7 has imposed coordinated sanctions on Russia over its war in Ukraine and launched a major global infrastructure investment program to counter China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative. The bloc built on these programs at its fiftieth summit, held in southern Italy in 2024. In Apulia, G7 countries agreed on a new framework to fund Ukraine with profits from frozen Russian assets and adopted a newly assertive approach toward China.\n\nWhy was the G7 formed, and how does it work?\n\nThe United States, France, Italy, Japan, the UK, and West Germany formed the Group of Six in 1975 to provide a venue for noncommunist powers to address pressing economic concerns, which included inflation and a recession sparked by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) oil embargo. Canada joined the following year, and Cold War politics invariably entered the group\u2019s agenda.\n\nDaily News Brief A summary of global news developments with CFR analysis delivered to your inbox each morning.

It is represented by the presidents of the European Council, which comprises EU member states\u2019 leaders, and of the European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive body. There is no formal criteria for membership, but all participants are wealthy democracies. The aggregate gross domestic product (GDP) of G7 member states (not including the EU) makes up about 43 percent of the global economy in nominal terms, down from nearly 70 percent three decades ago.\n\nUnlike the United Nations or the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the G7 is not a formal institution with a charter and a secretariat. The presidency, which rotates annually among member states, is responsible for setting the agenda of each year\u2019s summit and arranging logistics for it; in 2024, Italy is acting as president. Ministers and envoys, known as sherpas, hammer out policy initiatives at meetings that precede the gathering of national leaders. Nonmember countries are sometimes invited to participate in G7 meetings.\n\nWhat happened with Russia?\n\nRussia formally joined the group in 1998, making it the G8. U.S. President Bill Clinton thought that admitting Russia to the exclusive club would lend the country international prestige and encourage its first post-Soviet leader, Boris Yeltsin, to hew more closely to the West. Clinton also believed that membership would help mollify Russia as the NATO security alliance opened its doors to former Soviet satellites in Eastern Europe.\n\nClinton\u2019s decision drew some pushback. Finance ministries, in particular, were wary of coordinating economic policy with Russia, which had a relatively small economy and large public debt. But Russia\u2019s backsliding into authoritarianism under President Vladimir Putin has provoked an even stronger reaction. Moscow\u2019s annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine in March 2014 resulted in its indefinite suspension from the group. Frictions between Russia and the G7 also grew over Russia\u2019s support for Syria\u2019s Bashar al-Assad, especially in the wake of chemical attacks linked to Syrian forces, and over Russian interference in U.S. and European elections.\n\nAs Russia\u2019s intervention in Ukraine escalated, the United States and EU ratcheted up economic sanctions in an effort to further isolate Moscow. But the Ukraine conflict has only intensified, with Russia launching a full-scale invasion in early 2022. In response, G7 countries have levied unprecedented sanctions on Russia. These include phasing out imports of Russian oil and gas, a major source of revenue for Moscow, and barring Russian banks from transacting in dollars and euros. Other measures are aimed at curtailing Russia\u2019s military capabilities. G7 members have also provided weapons to Ukraine, collectively pledged more than $100 billion in financial and military aid, and agreed to loan the country an additional $50 billion using windfall profits from frozen Russian assets as collateral.\n\nWhat other challenges has the group faced?\n\nExperts hoped that the reconstituted G7 would have the potential to better facilitate collective action. Without Russia, the group was more \u201clike-minded and capable,\u201d according to former CFR fellow Stewart M. Patrick, currently the Director of the Global Order and Institutions Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. However, President Donald Trump challenged G7 unity on a number of issues, with trade and climate chief among them, contending that U.S. allies took advantage of the United States. Trump also split with the group by calling for Russia\u2019s readmission to the bloc. Other challenges stem from China\u2019s rise as a military and economic power, increasing nuclear proliferation, and the rise of AI.\n\nAt his first G7 summit, in 2017, Trump refused to commit the United States to the Paris Agreement on climate and hinted at plans to withdraw from the deal, leading other members to take the unusual step of singling out the United States in their final communiqu\u00e9. In an unprecedented statement following the summit, then German Chancellor Angela Merkel questioned the cohesiveness of the transatlantic relationship, saying that for the first time since World War II, Europe \u201cmust take our fate into our own hands.\u201d Other leaders and many analysts were alarmed by Trump\u2019s testy relationship with the rest of the group during his presidency. At the same time, European leaders of the G7 have contended with a laundry list of regional challenges, including navigating the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU and maintaining cohesion amid rising nationalism.\n\nAlongside the Russia challenge, the G7 has recently sought to respond to China\u2019s growing ambitions. Beijing\u2019s repression of Uyghurs in the Xinjiang region and its crackdown in Hong Kong have drawn condemnation from G7 members, and its massive Belt and Road Initiative has prompted concerns about its influence over developing countries. The United States, Japan, and the EU have all shared grievances over China\u2019s state-led economic model and alleged unfair trading practices. The country\u2019s growing trade and defense ties with Russia have also caused concerns. At the 2024 summit, G7 members overcame previous divisions within the group over how to respond to China; the final communiqu\u00e9 referenced Beijing dozens of times, almost always as an adversary.\n\nFallout from the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine has created additional obstacles. In 2020, the sharp global economic contraction caused by the pandemic forced G7 governments to respond with massive stimulus measures. In many countries, economic recovery has been accompanied by record levels of inflation and food insecurity. Meanwhile, repeated nuclear threats by Putin, alongside an increasingly bellicose North Korea, have reinvigorated worries about nuclear weapons. Some experts fear that rapidly advancing artificial intelligence could raise the risk of nuclear conflict. At the 2023 summit, the bloc unveiled the \u201cHiroshima AI Process,\u201d which seeks to develop a common framework for AI governance worldwide.\n\nAre there alternatives to the G7?\n\nIn addition to its internal divisions, external dynamics have chipped away at the G7\u2019s global influence, many analysts note. Some argue that the group lacks relevance without China and other emerging global powers. The bloc\u2019s current priorities \u201crisk failure\u201d unless they garner support from other countries, wrote Laura von Daniels, Head of the Americas Research Division at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, after the 2023 summit. Perhaps aware of this, G7 summits often include leaders from outside the bloc. Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, India, Jordan, Kenya, Mauritania, Tunisia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates all participated in 2024.\n\nMany analysts believe that the power and prestige of the Group of Twenty (G20), a forum for finance ministers and central bank governors from nineteen of the world\u2019s largest countries, the EU, and the African Union (AU), has surpassed that of the G7. Emerging powers including Brazil, China, India, Mexico, and South Africa all belong to the G20. Russia remains a member of the G20, despite calls by some G7 countries for its removal. The group\u2019s member states (not including the AU or EU) represent about 78 percent of global GDP and three-fifths of the world\u2019s population.\n\nMany observers argue that the G20 was most effective during the 2007\u201308 global financial crisis. G20 leaders first met in Washington in 2008, after the fall of the investment bank Lehman Brothers. While such consensus has been harder to come by in the years since the crisis, G20 summits have been the occasion for setting ambitious goals. At the 2014 summit, hosted by Australia, leaders adopted a plan to boost their economies by a collective 2.1 percent by 2018, which they did not achieve. In Hangzhou, China, in 2016, President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping used the summit to jointly announce their accession to the Paris Agreement.\n\nThere are also calls for new multilateral arrangements. Some experts previously endorsed an expansion of the G7 to include Australia, India, and South Korea, thereby forming a \u201cD10\u201d group of democracies. While president, Trump floated the idea of a Group of Eleven, comprising the D10 countries and Russia. For its part, Russia and eight other countries form the BRICS group, named for its other original members Brazil, India, China, and South Africa. The bloc admitted Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates in 2024.\n\nIn 2021, then CFR President Richard Haass and Senior Fellow Charles A. Kupchan called for a new concert of powers comprising the United States, China, the EU, India, Japan, and Russia, reminiscent of the nineteenth-century Concert of Europe. The proposed system would have permanent representatives supported by a secretariat to avoid what Haass and Kupchan described as the \u201cfly-in, fly-out\u201d nature of G7 and G20 summits.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for the G7?\n\nSome experts acknowledge that the G7\u2019s influence has diminished, but say that it still has value because all member countries are grappling with similar issues. \u201cThe G7 may no longer be a global agenda setter,\u201d writes Riccardo Alcaro, Research Coordinator and Head of the Global Actors Program at the Institute of International Affairs, an Italian think tank. \u201cYet, insofar as it generates consensus within the U.S.-led Western camp on the conditions for coordinating with geopolitical foes such as China and Russia and reaching out to the Global South, it will retain significant capacity to shape international relations.\u201d\n\nIndeed, achieving consensus on previously divisive issues proved a defining feature of the 2024 summit. In Italy, G7 leaders agreed to a long-debated plan to fund Ukraine using the future expected proceeds from seized Russian assets. European countries, which hold most of these reserves, had for months been reluctant to embrace this Washington-supported plan, making its adoption a \u201cmajor win for U.S. diplomacy,\u201d according to CFR Senior Fellow Matthias Matthijs. The summit also chastised China\u2014often referred to as a partner at past summits\u2014for supporting \u201cRussia\u2019s war machine,\u201d as well as for its assertiveness in the South China Sea and its \u201ceconomic coercion.\u201d On Israel\u2019s ongoing war in the Gaza Strip, the summit\u2019s final leaders' statement endorsed U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s plan for a cease-fire, expressing support for Israel while also urging it to reduce civilian casualties in its fight against Palestinian militant group Hamas.\n\nBut the bloc\u2019s newfound cohesion could be stymied by the domestic disapproval of nearly all of its leaders. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is the only G7 leader with an approval rating above 40 percent, and the United States, Canada, Japan, and the UK are due to hold elections by the end of 2025. \u201cWith potential leadership changes in at least half of the G7 governments in the next fifteen months, the Apulia summit could prove to be the high-water mark of G7 harmony, before a period of chaotic G7 discord and uncertainty,\u201d Matthijs writes.",

                "description": "Laura Feiveson, Deputy Assistant Secretary for MicroeconomicsArik Levinson, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Climate and Energy EconomicsSydney Schreiner Wertz, EconomistFor the past two decades, rents and house prices have been rising faster than incomes across most regions of the United States. For some households, increased housing costs means there is less to spend on everything else, including food, health care, clothing, education, and retirement savings.\u00a0 For others, particularly younger Americans, high costs may be preventing them from living on their own or starting families.\u00a0The affordability challenge is particularly severe for households of color and for low-income communities. Black and Hispanic households tend to spend higher shares of their incomes on housing expenses than white households.[1]\u00a0 And almost 90 percent of families with annual incomes below $20,000 spend more than 30 percent of their incomes on housing expenses\u2014a threshold used by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to indicate unaffordability. Sixty percent of families with incomes between $20,000 and $50,000 face the same challenge. These Americans are on the brink of being priced out of a basic human need.\u00a0For these urgent reasons, the Biden-Harris Administration is taking steps to expand the supply of housing and bring down costs for renters and homebuyers, at the same time as pushing for significant action from Congress and state and local governments. In this blog, we describe some of the root causes of U.S. housing cost growth and the large and slow-moving demographic changes that have led us to where we are today, motivating the need for significant and concerted action.Our main takeaways are:Over the last two decades, housing costs have been rising faster than incomes. More than 90 percent of Americans live in counties where median rents and house prices grew faster than median incomes from 2000 to 2020.Since 2000, housing demand has grown more than housing supply. This is largely due to changing demographics: although the construction of housing has kept pace with overall population growth, it has fallen well short of the estimated number of housing units demanded by an aging population.This is a longstanding problem, and substantial fixes will require federal legislative and state and local action.\u00a0 But the Biden Administration is not waiting for Congress to act and has taken many steps across multiple agencies to increase housing supply. Over the past couple of years, Treasury\u2019s actions include strengthening the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, implementing historic housing investments as part of the American Rescue Plan, supporting community development financial institutions and minority depository institutions, and permanently extending the Federal Financing Bank\u2019s financing support for a HUD risk-sharing initiative. Today, Secretary Yellen will outline additional efforts at Treasury to expand housing supply.I. Housing cost increasesSince 2000, housing costs have been rising faster than median household income (Figure 1). Inflation-adjusted rents have grown steadily, to more than 20 percent above their 2000 level. Inflation-adjusted prices for single-family homes have grown even faster, with a large boom and bust leading up to the financial crisis of the late 2000s and then a particularly sharp increase in the years following the onset of the pandemic. Over the entire period, inflation-adjusted house prices rose about 65 percent. In contrast, inflation-adjusted median household income barely rose over the whole time period.Figure 1. Real Housing Price, Rent and Wage IndexesThis point is broadly true across regions. From 2000 to 2020, median rents rose faster than median household income in 88 percent of U.S. counties, home to 97 percent of the U.S. population (Figure 2). And median house prices grew faster than overall inflation in 88 percent of counties, home to 95 percent of the population (Figure 3). And both median rents and house prices grew faster than overall inflation in 77 percent of counties, home to 93 percent of the population. Rents and home prices also rose in rural and urban areas, and for both single-family homes and apartments in multi-family buildings.[2]\u00a0 In sum, rising housing costs have been widespread and do not simply reflect a mismatch between locations and sectors in which housing is demanded and supplied.\u00a0Figure 2: Growth in median rents less growth in median income, 2000 to 2020Figure 3: Growth in median housing values less growth in median income, 2000 to 2020II. Demographic TrendsRising prices have resulted from growth in housing demand exceeding growth in housing supply. Over the last two decades, a major contributor to housing demand growth has been the changing demographic characteristics of the U.S. population.\u00a0Notably, the population has aged. In 2000, people aged 55 and over made up 20 percent of the U.S. population; by 2020, the 55-and-over share was 30 percent.\u00a0Older people are more likely to be the head of their own household, so as the population ages, demand for homes rises.[3]\u00a0The three panels of Figure 4 visually demonstrate the changing age distribution of housing demand in our population. The blue bars on the left side of each figure show the size of the population in each age range. The gray bars on the right side show the number of households headed by someone in each age range. As the baby boomers have moved from the youngest age ranges in 1980 to the middle age ranges in 2000 to the older age ranges in 2020, the distribution of housing demand has shifted notably. \u00a0 \u00a0Figure 4: Population and Households by AgeOne way to understand the interaction between the aging population and housing demand is by calculating the share of each age group that is a head of household. That is simply the ratio of the gray bars on the right side of Figure 4 to the blue bars on the left. Those ratios are called \u201cheadship rates.\u201d\u00a0Figure 5 shows the headship rates for different age ranges over time. Two facts jump out. First, older age groups have higher headship rates. So, as the population ages, there will be upward pressure on the overall headship rate in the population\u2014and, conversely, downward pressure on the number of people per household, all else equal.[4] Consequently, there will be upward pressure on the number of housing units demanded per person in the population.Second, age-specific headship rates have been declining for the past few decades for every adult age group.[5]\u00a0 One plausible explanation for declining headship rates is the rising housing costs detailed in the previous section.\u00a0Figure 5: Per-Age Headship RatesThe youngest groups have experienced the largest declines in headship rates. In 1980, 50 percent of Americans aged 25 to 34 were heads of their own household (the lowest line on Figure 4). In 2020, that number had fallen to around 40 percent. The headship rate for Americans aged 35 to 44 also fell substantially: from almost 55 percent to less than 50 percent. The decline in headship rates for younger Americans can be seen in the rise of young adults living at home over the same period, as shown in Figure 6. This rise is at least partially attributable to rising rents and house prices.[6]Figure 6. Share of Adults Aged 25 to 34 Living with a ParentIII. Housing demand has outpaced supplyHousing demand growth since 2000 can be assessed by calculating the number of homes that would be required to accommodate the current U.S. population if headship rates for each age group had stayed at their 2000 values. The top line of Figure 7 shows that calculation, estimating that housing demand grew by 26 percent between 2000 and 2020.\u00a0By comparison, Figure 7 shows that the actual housing stock\u2014housing supply\u2014grew by only 19 percent.\u00a0So, the growth in housing demand has outpaced supply\u2014a potentially important cause of rising rents and house prices. Population growth\u2014the bottom line in Figure 7\u2014grew by only 17 percent over this same period.\u00a0In short, housing cost increases have not arisen because population\u00a0outpaced supply. It has not. Instead, housing cost increases have resulted from housing demand outpacing supply, driven in part by demographic shifts.\u00a0Figure 7: Population, estimated housing demand, and housing stock percent growth since 2000IV. Why construction hasn\u2019t kept up pace and the role of policySo why hasn\u2019t housing construction kept pace with the growth of housing demand? One cause of housing undersupply may be local land-use regulations and zoning restrictions.[7]\u00a0 Minimum lot sizes and limits on multifamily apartment buildings can increase prices by limiting supply.[8] Loosening those regulations would remove barriers to new construction, expand housing supply, and lower the rents faced by all households, including those with lower incomes.[9]\u00a0In many places, and for many low-income households, barriers to construction are not the sole culprit. Many households\u2019 incomes are simply too low to spur growth in the supply of reasonably safe and sanitary housing. The future rents they could afford to pay would be insufficient to cover the construction costs of new apartments or houses.[10] And new market-rate construction geared towards higher-income households only has limited success in opening affordable vacancies in older buildings.[11]\u00a0Governments\u2014state, local, and Federal\u2014have good reason to work towards overcoming these barriers to ensure a sufficient supply of affordable housing. Housing is a basic human need. Furthermore, investments in affordable housing support our economy\u2019s medium- and long-run growth. Having an affordable home allows workers to live close to the high-quality jobs where they are most productive, which is particularly important give the ongoing resurgence in American manufacturing.[12] Moreover, there is an abundance of evidence that stable housing provides benefits to children that increase their future long-term success.[13]\u00a0Government policy can support housing supply and affordability in numerous ways: by subsidizing housing construction, by subsidizing renters, by subsidizing home buyers, and by incentivizing state and local governments to remove outdated zoning and land use policies.[14] One of the Federal government\u2019s largest sources of support for affordable housing is administered by Treasury: the Low Income Housing Tax Credit, or LIHTC, which subsidizes the construction and preservation of affordable housing.V. Biden-Harris and Treasury PoliciesThe Biden-Harris Administration and Treasury recognize the urgent need to address housing affordability.\u00a0 In 2022, the Biden-Harris Administration released a\u00a0Housing Supply Action Plan, which included actions across multiple agencies intended to create more affordable housing. In its latest budget, the Biden Administration has called on Congress to invest more than $175 billion to help grow housing supply, including through the expansion of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit. The Administration has also encouraged state and local governments to work to reduce barriers to more housing construction.In the meantime, Treasury is not waiting for Congress to act. Over the past few years, Treasury\u2019s American Rescue Plan programs have enabled state and local governments to deploy billions of dollars to create new and improve existing affordable housing stock.\u00a0Treasury has also supported the construction of affordable housing through the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, the largest source of financing for affordable housing in the country, as well as Treasury\u2019s support for community\u00a0development financial institutions and minority depository\u00a0institutions, which enable these institutions to make housing loans and investments to communities hit hardest by the pandemic. Earlier this year, in a\u00a0blog post, Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo announced a range of Treasury actions to help expand housing supply.\u00a0Today, Secretary Janet Yellen is announcing several additional key housing initiatives in a speech in Minnesota. First, Treasury will be establishing a new program administered by the CDFI Fund that will provide an additional $100 million over the next three years to support the financing of affordable housing. Second, we are working on a major improvement to bolster the Federal Financing Bank\u2019s financing of affordable housing through its support of HUD\u2019s Section 542 Housing Finance Agency Risk-Sharing Initiative. This builds on the recent indefinite extension of the program, which is estimated to help preserve or create 38,000 affordable units over the next decade. Third, we are engaging with the Federal Home Loan Banks, which play a key role in the housing finance system, to explore ways that they can increase their voluntary commitments to housing programs. And fourth, the CDFI Fund is updating the Capital Magnet Fund rule to provide greater flexibility and reduce administrative burden on recipients, which reflects input that Treasury has received from stakeholders.There will not be a quick fix to the long-term rise in housing costs. But the Federal and state and local governments play an important role in ensuring that all Americans have affordable and safe homes. The actions taken now are an important start, and the Administration is prioritizing laying the groundwork for larger legislative action when Congress is ready to act.\u00a0[1] Specifically, in 2022, 57 and 54 percent of renting households with a Black or Hispanic head, respectively, spent more than 30 percent of their income on housing expenses, as opposed to only 45 percent of renting households with a white head.\u00a0More Than 42 Million US Households Were Cost Burdened in 2022 | Joint Center for Housing Studies (harvard.edu)[2] For multi-family rental price index, see Freddie Mac. For single-family home price index, see S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Index.[3] See Figure 5.\u00a0[4] Since headship rates have been declining for all age groups, the aggregate effect of an aging population on the number of people per household was muted. Nevertheless, the number of people per household did decrease slightly from 2.7 in 2000 to 2.6 in 2020.\u00a0[5] Note that there is evidence of a decline in headship rates and subsequent rebound in 2020 due to changes in living arrangements related to the Covid-19 pandemic (see\u00a0The Fed - The Remarkable Recent Rebound in Household Formation and the Prospects for Future Housing Demand (federalreserve.gov)). We believe our estimates of 2020 headship rates are likely unaffected by these within-2020 changes because we use data from the 5-year American Community Survey, which were collected from January 2016 to December 2020. While this time period covers the period in which the decline in headship rates and subsequent rebound have been documented, 2020 represents a relatively small share of the entire period during which the data used to generate these estimates were collected.\u00a0[6]\u00a0The Fed - The Long and the Short of Household Formation (federalreserve.gov)[7] E.g., Jason Furman, Barriers to Shared Growth: Land Use Regulation and Economic Rents (2015[8] For example, see\u00a0Ihlanfeldt (2007) and\u00a0Zabel and Dalton (2011).[9]\u00a0JUE Insight: The effect of new market-rate housing construction on the low-income housing market - ScienceDirect[10]\u00a0The cost of affordable housing: Does it pencil out?

        "text": "Rent, House Prices, and Demographics\nLaura Feiveson, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Microeconomics\n\nArik Levinson, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Climate and Energy Economics\n\nSydney Schreiner Wertz, Economist\n\nFor the past two decades, rents and house prices have been rising faster than incomes across most regions of the United States. For some households, increased housing costs means there is less to spend on everything else, including food, health care, clothing, education, and retirement savings. For others, particularly younger Americans, high costs may be preventing them from living on their own or starting families.\n\nThe affordability challenge is particularly severe for households of color and for low-income communities. Black and Hispanic households tend to spend higher shares of their incomes on housing expenses than white households.[1] And almost 90 percent of families with annual incomes below $20,000 spend more than 30 percent of their incomes on housing expenses\u2014a threshold used by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to indicate unaffordability. Sixty percent of families with incomes between $20,000 and $50,000 face the same challenge. These Americans are on the brink of being priced out of a basic human need.\n\nFor these urgent reasons, the Biden-Harris Administration is taking steps to expand the supply of housing and bring down costs for renters and homebuyers, at the same time as pushing for significant action from Congress and state and local governments. In this blog, we describe some of the root causes of U.S. housing cost growth and the large and slow-moving demographic changes that have led us to where we are today, motivating the need for significant and concerted action.\n\nOur main takeaways are:\n\nOver the last two decades, housing costs have been rising faster than incomes. More than 90 percent of Americans live in counties where median rents and house prices grew faster than median incomes from 2000 to 2020.\n\nSince 2000, housing demand has grown more than housing supply. This is largely due to changing demographics: although the construction of housing has kept pace with overall population growth, it has fallen well short of the estimated number of housing units demanded by an aging population.\n\nThis is a longstanding problem, and substantial fixes will require federal legislative and state and local action. But the Biden Administration is not waiting for Congress to act and has taken many steps across multiple agencies to increase housing supply. Over the past couple of years, Treasury\u2019s actions include strengthening the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, implementing historic housing investments as part of the American Rescue Plan, supporting community development financial institutions and minority depository institutions, and permanently extending the Federal Financing Bank\u2019s financing support for a HUD risk-sharing initiative. Today, Secretary Yellen will outline additional efforts at Treasury to expand housing supply.\n\nI. Housing cost increases\n\nSince 2000, housing costs have been rising faster than median household income (Figure 1). Inflation-adjusted rents have grown steadily, to more than 20 percent above their 2000 level. Inflation-adjusted prices for single-family homes have grown even faster, with a large boom and bust leading up to the financial crisis of the late 2000s and then a particularly sharp increase in the years following the onset of the pandemic. Over the entire period, inflation-adjusted house prices rose about 65 percent. In contrast, inflation-adjusted median household income barely rose over the whole time period.\n\nFigure 1. Real Housing Price, Rent and Wage Indexes\n\nThis point is broadly true across regions. From 2000 to 2020, median rents rose faster than median household income in 88 percent of U.S. counties, home to 97 percent of the U.S. population (Figure 2). And median house prices grew faster than overall inflation in 88 percent of counties, home to 95 percent of the population (Figure 3). And both median rents and house prices grew faster than overall inflation in 77 percent of counties, home to 93 percent of the population. Rents and home prices also rose in rural and urban areas, and for both single-family homes and apartments in multi-family buildings.[2] In sum, rising housing costs have been widespread and do not simply reflect a mismatch between locations and sectors in which housing is demanded and supplied.\n\nFigure 2: Growth in median rents less growth in median income, 2000 to 2020\n\nFigure 3: Growth in median housing values less growth in median income, 2000 to 2020\n\nII. Demographic Trends\n\nRising prices have resulted from growth in housing demand exceeding growth in housing supply. Over the last two decades, a major contributor to housing demand growth has been the changing demographic characteristics of the U.S. population. Notably, the population has aged. In 2000, people aged 55 and over made up 20 percent of the U.S. population; by 2020, the 55-and-over share was 30 percent. Older people are more likely to be the head of their own household, so as the population ages, demand for homes rises.[3]\n\nThe three panels of Figure 4 visually demonstrate the changing age distribution of housing demand in our population. The blue bars on the left side of each figure show the size of the population in each age range. The gray bars on the right side show the number of households headed by someone in each age range. As the baby boomers have moved from the youngest age ranges in 1980 to the middle age ranges in 2000 to the older age ranges in 2020, the distribution of housing demand has shifted notably.\n\nFigure 4: Population and Households by Age\n\nOne way to understand the interaction between the aging population and housing demand is by calculating the share of each age group that is a head of household. That is simply the ratio of the gray bars on the right side of Figure 4 to the blue bars on the left. Those ratios are called \u201cheadship rates.\u201d\n\nFigure 5 shows the headship rates for different age ranges over time. Two facts jump out. First, older age groups have higher headship rates. So, as the population ages, there will be upward pressure on the overall headship rate in the population\u2014and, conversely, downward pressure on the number of people per household, all else equal.[4] Consequently, there will be upward pressure on the number of housing units demanded per person in the population.\n\nSecond, age-specific headship rates have been declining for the past few decades for every adult age group.[5] One plausible explanation for declining headship rates is the rising housing costs detailed in the previous section.\n\nFigure 5: Per-Age Headship Rates\n\nThe youngest groups have experienced the largest declines in headship rates. In 1980, 50 percent of Americans aged 25 to 34 were heads of their own household (the lowest line on Figure 4). In 2020, that number had fallen to around 40 percent. The headship rate for Americans aged 35 to 44 also fell substantially: from almost 55 percent to less than 50 percent. The decline in headship rates for younger Americans can be seen in the rise of young adults living at home over the same period, as shown in Figure 6. This rise is at least partially attributable to rising rents and house prices.[6]\n\nFigure 6. Share of Adults Aged 25 to 34 Living with a Parent\n\nIII. Housing demand has outpaced supply\n\nHousing demand growth since 2000 can be assessed by calculating the number of homes that would be required to accommodate the current U.S. population if headship rates for each age group had stayed at their 2000 values. The top line of Figure 7 shows that calculation, estimating that housing demand grew by 26 percent between 2000 and 2020.\n\nBy comparison, Figure 7 shows that the actual housing stock\u2014housing supply\u2014grew by only 19 percent. So, the growth in housing demand has outpaced supply\u2014a potentially important cause of rising rents and house prices. Population growth\u2014the bottom line in Figure 7\u2014grew by only 17 percent over this same period.\n\nIn short, housing cost increases have not arisen because population outpaced supply. It has not. Instead, housing cost increases have resulted from housing demand outpacing supply, driven in part by demographic shifts.\n\nFigure 7: Population, estimated housing demand, and housing stock percent growth since 2000\n\nIV. Why construction hasn\u2019t kept up pace and the role of policy\n\nSo why hasn\u2019t housing construction kept pace with the growth of housing demand? One cause of housing undersupply may be local land-use regulations and zoning restrictions.[7] Minimum lot sizes and limits on multifamily apartment buildings can increase prices by limiting supply.[8] Loosening those regulations would remove barriers to new construction, expand housing supply, and lower the rents faced by all households, including those with lower incomes.[9]\n\nIn many places, and for many low-income households, barriers to construction are not the sole culprit. Many households\u2019 incomes are simply too low to spur growth in the supply of reasonably safe and sanitary housing. The future rents they could afford to pay would be insufficient to cover the construction costs of new apartments or houses.[10] And new market-rate construction geared towards higher-income households only has limited success in opening affordable vacancies in older buildings.[11]\n\nGovernments\u2014state, local, and Federal\u2014have good reason to work towards overcoming these barriers to ensure a sufficient supply of affordable housing. Housing is a basic human need. Furthermore, investments in affordable housing support our economy\u2019s medium- and long-run growth. Having an affordable home allows workers to live close to the high-quality jobs where they are most productive, which is particularly important give the ongoing resurgence in American manufacturing.[12] Moreover, there is an abundance of evidence that stable housing provides benefits to children that increase their future long-term success.[13]\n\nGovernment policy can support housing supply and affordability in numerous ways: by subsidizing housing construction, by subsidizing renters, by subsidizing home buyers, and by incentivizing state and local governments to remove outdated zoning and land use policies.[14] One of the Federal government\u2019s largest sources of support for affordable housing is administered by Treasury: the Low Income Housing Tax Credit, or LIHTC, which subsidizes the construction and preservation of affordable housing.\n\nV. Biden-Harris and Treasury Policies\n\nThe Biden-Harris Administration and Treasury recognize the urgent need to address housing affordability. In 2022, the Biden-Harris Administration released a Housing Supply Action Plan, which included actions across multiple agencies intended to create more affordable housing. In its latest budget, the Biden Administration has called on Congress to invest more than $175 billion to help grow housing supply, including through the expansion of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit. The Administration has also encouraged state and local governments to work to reduce barriers to more housing construction.\n\nIn the meantime, Treasury is not waiting for Congress to act. Over the past few years, Treasury\u2019s American Rescue Plan programs have enabled state and local governments to deploy billions of dollars to create new and improve existing affordable housing stock. Treasury has also supported the construction of affordable housing through the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, the largest source of financing for affordable housing in the country, as well as Treasury\u2019s support for community development financial institutions and minority depository institutions, which enable these institutions to make housing loans and investments to communities hit hardest by the pandemic. Earlier this year, in a blog post, Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo announced a range of Treasury actions to help expand housing supply.\n\nToday, Secretary Janet Yellen is announcing several additional key housing initiatives in a speech in Minnesota. First, Treasury will be establishing a new program administered by the CDFI Fund that will provide an additional $100 million over the next three years to support the financing of affordable housing. Second, we are working on a major improvement to bolster the Federal Financing Bank\u2019s financing of affordable housing through its support of HUD\u2019s Section 542 Housing Finance Agency Risk-Sharing Initiative. This builds on the recent indefinite extension of the program, which is estimated to help preserve or create 38,000 affordable units over the next decade. Third, we are engaging with the Federal Home Loan Banks, which play a key role in the housing finance system, to explore ways that they can increase their voluntary commitments to housing programs. And fourth, the CDFI Fund is updating the Capital Magnet Fund rule to provide greater flexibility and reduce administrative burden on recipients, which reflects input that Treasury has received from stakeholders.\n\nThere will not be a quick fix to the long-term rise in housing costs. But the Federal and state and local governments play an important role in ensuring that all Americans have affordable and safe homes. The actions taken now are an important start, and the Administration is prioritizing laying the groundwork for larger legislative action when Congress is ready to act.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Impact of the 2024 U.S. Ele...\nThis blog was published as a two-part series.\n\n\n\n\n\nPart One\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s hard to turn on the news without hearing about the upcoming U.S. presidential election and the potential issues and concerns driving votes come November. Arguably top amongst those issues is immigration \u2014 which has been a sore spot for U.S. government policymakers for decades but never more so than over the past two electoral cycles.\n\n\n\nWith millions of immigrants \u2014 both documented and undocumented \u2014 entering the country each year, it\u2019s important for both immigrants and residents of the United States to grasp and understand the immigration related policy ramifications associated with the respective candidates vying for executive office in the 2024 electoral cycle.\n\n\n\nRepublicans and Democrats typically have vastly differing party views on immigration. Immigration has been a major campaign issue over the last several presidential election cycles and is likely to remain so moving forward. Which party retains or takes power in the Executive Branch will have much to do with whether the U.S. policy toward immigration shifts to prioritizing allowing more immigrants in and legalizing those there without authorization currently or keeping immigrants out of the United States and enforcing the law against those who are currently there illegally. With millions of undocumented intending immigrants crossing U.S. borders without authorization over the past several years, the fate of these intending immigrants \u2014 whether they are permitted to stay and given a path to citizenship or deported to their home countries and required to go through a legal process to enter and stay in the United States \u2014 also may lie with the incoming president.\n\n\n\n\n\nWho makes immigration law?\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Congress, made up of the House of Representatives and the Senate, is the law-making body of the U.S. federal government. Congress drafts bills and votes to pass all immigration-related proposals and changes into law. Once approved by both houses of Congress, the bill goes to the president to ratify (approve) or veto (reject). If the president ratifies the bill, it becomes law.\n\n\n\nThis seems pretty straightforward, so where\u2019s the issue?\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Congress has not been able to agree on comprehensive immigration reform measures to fix what are seen as major issues in the existing immigration system for decades. As a result, very few laws have been passed directly changing major components of our immigration system in the recent\u2014 or even somewhat distant \u2014 past. However, \u201cWe, the People\u201d continue to have quite strong opinions about who should be permitted into the United States, permitted to stay and permitted to obtain citizenship.\n\n\n\nOn the Democratic party side, proponents tend to focus on humanitarian admissions and aid, regardless of historical priorities like skills, education and close family relationships with U.S. citizens. Some Republicans argue that this does not account for the need for immigrants to have jobs to support themselves and their families and that an influx of lower-skilled labor could impact the availability of jobs to U.S. workers and their families. On the other hand, Republicans historically have sought to protect U.S. jobs and create a sustainable system to vet immigrant candidates, which seeks a balance between job creation strategies, family reunification priorities and humanitarian needs. Some Democrats argue that this leaves desperate people with no way to escape terrible life circumstances and situations and that more cultural diversity \u2014 regardless of skills or the ability to support oneself \u2014 only strengthens U.S. society. After all, the United States is, at its core, a nation of immigrants.\n\n\n\nWhile the ineffectiveness of Congress to achieve comprehensive and effective immigration reform is not likely to be impacted by the presidential election cycle because immigration remains such a huge issue to the public, whichever president is elected will likely seek to put executive actions in place to effect temporary immigration change. \u201cExecutive actions\u201d include any action taken by the president or federal agencies to interpret, implement and enforce agency authority granted by existing laws. One type of executive action is a Presidential Executive Order (EO), which is a specific directive issued by the president to federal agencies, department heads or federal employees. These orders \u2014although not voted on by the houses of Congress directly representing the people of the 50 United States \u2014 are legally binding. In this way, a president has the authority to supersede or \u201cworkaround\u201d historical interpretations of immigration laws by \u201cinterpreting\u201d laws differently, although their executive orders or actions can be revoked by the incoming president following the next presidential election cycle four years later (and often are).\n\n\n\n\n\nPart Two\n\n\n\nAs we discussed in the first article in this series, immigration seems to be on everyone\u2019s minds, as candidates campaign for U.S. votes in the November 2024 election. The person who is elected as the next president of the United States can easily impact immigration and effectuate temporary change based on their priorities.\n\n\n\nIn the current administration under President Joe Biden, we have seen sweeping immigration reforms implemented by executive action. In his first three years alone, President Biden took 535 immigration-related executive actions. These have included actions that have been welcoming to intending immigrants \u2014 such as the border policies we have seen over the past four years \u2014 and more recently, more restrictive in nature, such as the June 2024 executive order that created a rule that can temporarily turn away migrants seeking asylum after there have been seven consecutive days of over 2,500 encounters (until there have been two straight weeks of less than 1,500 border encounters). The latest news reports are speculating that the Biden administration is currently considering a proposal to protect undocumented spouses of U.S. citizens from deportation and allow them to work in the country legally.\n\n\n\nThe prevailing Republican candidate at the moment \u2014 former president Donald Trump \u2014 on the other hand, took 472 immigration-related executive actions while president, from 2017 to 2020. These included actions to construct a border wall, allocate additional resources to the U.S. Border Patrol and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and increase the construction of detention facilities and efforts to detain intending immigrants who had entered illegally or otherwise violated immigration laws. Trump has already indicated on the campaign trail that he intends to deport many of the intending immigrants who have entered the United States illegally under the Biden administration policies and practices if re-elected to the office of president for an additional four-year term.\n\n\n\nWhy does this matter?\n\n\n\nImmigrants impact the U.S. economy and culture in so many ways \u2014 both positively and negatively. Immigration laws and policies are meant to result from a balance of equities, weighing public policy and the convenience or hardship to both U.S. persons and intending immigrants to determine the fairness of granting or denying benefits. On the one hand, a massive influx of immigrants could deeply impact things like taxes, homelessness and welfare resources, as many of those who have entered over the past several years are escaping deep poverty or oppressive political systems and may have limited or no existing support system in the United States. The public concern is that there may not be enough jobs to allow these individuals to provide for themselves and/or their families \u2014 because U.S. job growth is not growing at a rate equal to the jobs needed by both U.S. persons and this new population of intending immigrants. As a result, U.S. citizens or those with legal status could end up being displaced by workers who are willing to take lower pay and less favorable working conditions in order to have jobs.\n\n\n\nOne way we might be able to combat this impact would be by increasing the amount of legal immigration permitted. Legal U.S. immigration currently prioritizes education, skills and family reunification to determine who should be permitted to come to the U.S. On the employment side, educated and skilled workers have historically been seen as more likely to contribute in a way that will create jobs and opportunities rather than simply fill a spot at a business. Likewise, immigrants who have an existing support system in place in the United States already are less likely to end up homeless or requesting benefits from the U.S. government \u2014 and thereby, the U.S. taxpayer \u2014 than those who have no support system in place. By increasing the number of nonimmigrant visas and available green cards to qualifying immigrants with jobs or close family members in the United States or who wish to invest substantial amounts of money in the United States, the country may better position itself to create more jobs and a sustainable environment for asylum seekers and their families.\n\n\n\n\n\nWill chances of coming to the United States be better in 2025?\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is no guarantee that immigration will be smoother or easier for all in 2025, regardless of who is voted in. Each president and their administration has their unique priorities \u2014 and even executive actions can be questioned and end up in court if they are challenged for not supporting existing laws. Comprehensive immigration reform is unlikely to be suggested or passed until (and only if) both houses of Congress are held by a single political party \u2014 and even then, it very well could not happen, as we saw when the Democratic party held a majority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate for a time under Barack Obama, and when the Republican party held a majority in both chambers for a time under Trump.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to maximize chances of obtaining status in the United States, regardless of the election?\n\n\n\nThere are dozens of legal ways to enter the United States and obtain a status that permits work and provides a potential path to citizenship \u2014 both through family members and through work opportunities. All day long, every day, immigration law practitioners such as those at our firm help foreign individuals and families who wish to come to the United States to determine their best path to permanent residence, as well as eventual citizenship if that is their ultimate goal. While immigrating to the United States permanently is not always easy and is rarely quick, there are and have always been policies and rules in place permitting and welcoming immigrants to the United States.\n\n\n\nWhile the jury is still out on whether mass amnesty will be granted to the millions of undocumented migrants who have entered the United States without authorization over the past several years, there are still dozens of ways to come to the United States under the existing rules and regulations. The best way to determine the best and surest options for long-term immigration to the United States is to contact an immigration professional whose entire business depends on successfully communicating options and supporting foreigners moving to the United States. If no option currently exists for you, immigration professionals can often suggest ways to improve your skills or abilities in order to qualify for status sooner rather than later.",

        "text": "Rwanda 2024 election: One killed in Paul Kagame rally crush in Rubavu\nDeadly crush at rally as Rwanda election campaign starts\n\nMr Kagame lauched his campaign for a fourth term over the weekend\n\nIt apologised to the deceased's family, adding that a medical team on site \"did everything possible\".\n\nThe crush happened on Sunday in Rubavu district, where 37 people were injured, four of whom were hospitalised with serious injuries, a statement from the ministry of local government said.\n\nCampaigning for July's general election began on Saturday, with Mr Kagame holding two rallies in northern Rwanda over the weekend.\n\nOne person has died and dozens were injured during a crush at an election rally for Rwanda's President Paul Kagame, officials say.\n\nMr Kagame is running for a fourth term. He has been the country's de facto leader since 1994, when his then rebel group, the Rwanda Patriotic Front, seized power at the end of the genocide directed at members of his Tutsi ethnic group.\n\nHe won the last presidential election in 2017 with nearly 99% of the vote.\n\nThe 66-year-old president has faced criticism from rights groups for cracking down on the opposition - but he has fierecly defended Rwanda's record on human rights, saying his country respects political freedoms.\n\nAfter Sunday's stampede, the ministry of local government reminded \"those participating in campaign activities... to follow the instructions given by those in charge to ensure the safety and tranquillity of those participating in campaign activities\".\n\nOn Monday morning, Mr Kagame's RPF-Inkotanyi party said it was \"deeply saddened\" and sent its condolences to the deceased's family.\n\n\"The RPF-Inkotanyi organisation will continue to... closely monitor those injured in the crush,\" it said in a statement published on social media.\n\nEarlier, the party posted a video on Facebook of Mr Kagame taking the stage at the rally. Crowds of supporters, decked out in party colours, can be seen dancing, cheering, and waving flags. Some 250,000 people were in attendance, the party said.\n\nMr Kagame will face two other politicians - Frank Habineza of the Democratic Green Party and independent Philippe Mpayimana - in the race to become president.\n\nDiane Rwigara, an outspoken critic of Mr Kagame, was barred from standing in next month\u2019s presidential election.\n\nThe electoral commission said Ms Rwigara had failed to provide the correct documentation to show she had no criminal record and had not shown she had enough support nationwide to stand.\n\nMs Rwigara, who was also disqualified from the 2017 poll, dismissed these reasons, saying she had been \"cheated\" out of her \"right to campaign\".\n\nRwandans will head to the polls on 15 July to elect their next president and lawmakers.",

        "text": "Ahead of Biden-Trump debate, Georgia voters weigh 2024 decision\n'It's in God's hands now': Georgia voters brace for close election\n\nBrandon Drenon/BBC Torino Henry (left) says he thinks both Joe Biden and Donald Trump are bad candidates. He doesn't plan on voting for either\n\nJoe Biden defeated Donald Trump by fewer than 12,000 votes to win the crucial state of Georgia in the 2020 election, elevating its status as an influential political battleground. The two men will face off in the first presidential debate in Atlanta on Thursday, putting a spotlight on the pivotal role Georgia will again play in November.\n\nOn a hot summer Sunday, hundreds gathered in Atlanta's Piedmont Park to celebrate Juneteenth, America\u2019s newest national holiday, which commemorates the end of slavery. There were smiles and laughter. Corn dogs and curly fries. Pride and pain. Jimmy Hill was there, resting beneath the shade of a tree. He sat next to an installation of columns erected in the park, each decorated with synthetic roses and the faces of black Americans shot and killed by police. One of the faces \u2013 Jimmy Atchison \u2013 was Mr Hill\u2019s son. Mr Hill voted for Joe Biden in 2020, lured by the Democratic candidate\u2019s promises for police reform. \u201cI\u2019ve always voted Democrat,\u201d the 62-year-old said. But four years later, his allegiance to the party is beginning to waver. \u201c[Biden] hasn\u2019t done anything on police reform,\u201d Mr Hill said. \u201cThe conversation has gone out the back door.\u201d\n\nBrandon Drenon/BBC Jimmy Hill has seen two sons killed by guns. He's voting against lawmakers that wish to ease gun access\n\nHis uncertainty reflects broader concerns among Georgia's black and Latino population, a reliable Democratic voting bloc now showing signs of a crumbling coalition. The group voted in record numbers in 2020, helping Joe Biden to win the state by less than 1%. The upset victory arrived on the heels of a long-diversifying population and high-profile local Democrats also on the ballot. On Thursday, a mile from the Juneteenth celebration in Piedmont Park, President Biden and his Republican opponent Donald Trump will come under the lights of the primetime television debate stage for the first time in four years. Each man - president and former president - will be trying to convince the nation that they deserve another term in the White House. The road to get there runs through battleground states like Georgia, where voters know they play an outsized role in deciding who becomes president. In November, the razor-thin race is set to be decided here and in a handful of other states across the nation: Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Arizona and Nevada. Current polling shows Mr Biden has lost significant ground in Georgia. A March survery by the BBC\u2019s media partner CBS News found the former president leading President Biden by 3%.\n\nBrandon Drenon/BBC Shaun Gray (left) says he will not vote for Joe Biden and is considering Donald Trump\n\nA \u2018perfect storm\u2019 in 2020\n\nBefore 2020, a Democratic candidate for president hadn\u2019t been elected in Georgia since 1992. But a confluence of unique events helped push Joe Biden over the line, including record voter turnout from the state\u2019s growing population of young, black and Latino voters. In 2020, a deadly pandemic had engulfed the globe and shut down much of daily life. The election also came amid a nationwide racial reckoning following widespread protests over the police killings of George Floyd and other black Americans \u2014 an issue Mr Biden vowed to tackle on the campaign trail. Two months after Mr Biden\u2019s win, the state elected two Democrats, including its first black senator, Raphael Warnock, to the US Senate, in runoff elections. The upset victories flipped the state\u2019s two seats from red to blue and handed control of the upper chamber to Democrats. \u201c2020 was a different beast,\u201d said Kendra Cotton, executive director of the New Georgia Project, a non-partisan organisation that leads voter outreach efforts among metro Atlanta\u2019s communities of colour. \u201cWhen you talk about getting people out, it was like a perfect storm.\u201d Many in Georgia attribute record turnout to the state\u2019s grassroots coalition, a decade-long project led by Democrat and former gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams. Abrams founded the New Georgia Project and Fair Fight, two of Georgia\u2019s largest voting rights organisations. But many of the dynamics that motivated black and Latino voters and powered Mr Biden\u2019s win have disappeared. And some organisers worry new challenges \u2013 from inflation to the Israel-Gaza war \u2013 are causing Mr Biden\u2019s grip on the consequential voting bloc to slip. \u201cPeople are concerned about the cost of living. The rising housing costs. The lack of affordability,\u201d Ms Cotton said. The fallout from the Israel-Gaza war is \u201csomething that\u2019s weighing on the hearts and minds of voters we reach out to,\u201d she added. \u201cVoters are not enthusiastic about their choices.\" The 2024 landscape has left Republicans and Democrats puzzled about what will happen in November. Elisha Bennett, a Republican, put it this way: \u201cIt\u2019s in God\u2019s hands now.\u201d\n\nBrandon Drenon/BBC Trump paraphernalia on sale at the Trump Store & More in East Ellijay, Georgia\n\nTrump \u2018took care of us\u2019\n\nRoughly 77 miles (123km) north of Atlanta, in the rolling hills of East Ellijay, the tone among voters contrasts heavily with those at Piedmont Park. There, amid the pockets of wild daisies and gun stores dotting the road, lies the Trump Store & More. \u201cI voted for Trump in 2016, and 2020, and I will vote for him again,\u201d Fran Diemer, the store\u2019s clerk, said. \u201cHe\u2019s the best thing to ever happen to this country and we need him back.\u201d Standing behind the counter, where Trump\u2019s face appears on everything from pins to pocketknives, she reflected on his presidency with a big grin. \u201cGas was cheap. Groceries were cheap. Taxes were cheap. He took care of us,\u201d she said. On Sunday, the same day as Atlanta\u2019s final Juneteenth celebration, people in East Ellijay gathered at the Lions Club Fairgrounds to view the Vietnam Traveling Memorial Wall, about two miles from the Trump store. Gloria Murphy, a nearby resident, came there to pay tribute to her high school friend that was killed in the war. Like, Ms Diemer, she had also consistently voted for Trump and said her enthusiasm to do so again remained high. \u201cThe economy, the war, it\u2019s just disheartening to see everybody fighting,\u201d she said. \u201cSince Biden has been in office, people\u2019s sense of patriotism has dwindled. I\u2019m hoping Trump can restore that somehow.\u201d Margot, a Trump supporter who was also at the memorial but did not want to share her last name, said: \u201cIf nothing changes politically, it is going to be, in my opinion, a very different and very scary world.\u201d\n\nBrandon Drenon/BBC Gloria Murphy's high school friend Fred Bonner was killed in the Vietnam War. His name is listed on the wall behind her\n\nA changing demographic landscape\n\nThere are 159 counties in Georgia, and most of them are like East Ellijay\u2019s Gilmer County: rural and Republican. But roughly 45% of the state\u2019s population lives in just 10 counties, in the dense urban areas that make up metro Atlanta. These counties have seen a population boom in the last 10-plus years, driven by a swell in young, college-educated, racially and ethnically diverse groups \u2013 typically Democratic leaning. When Joe Biden won in 2020, he extended the lead for Democrats in many of these areas, including some counties where, in 2012, and decades prior, a Republican had won. Cobb, Gwinnett and Henry County are three that flipped from Republican to Democrat in 2016. That year, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton narrowly won each county with an average 50.2% of votes. President Biden grew that lead significantly in 2020, averaging 58.1%. These three counties also saw some of the biggest growth and demographic changes over the same period. Gwinnett is Georgia\u2019s second largest county by population size. In 2010, its population was 50.8% white, 31.3% black, 22.3% Latino and 13.8% Asian, according to Census Bureau data. But by 2020, the percentage of white residents dropped to 35.5% as its population added over 151,000 people. \u201cGeorgia is a growth state,\u201d Charles Bullock, a University of Georgia political science professor says. Job prospects are typically what draws the crowd, he said.\n\nBrandon Drenon/BBC Golf carts are common means of transportation in Peachtree City. Roughly 11,000 golf carts are registered with the city\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not voting anymore\u2019\n\nIn Peachtree City, an idyllic suburb in the Republican stronghold of Fayette County, 100 miles of paved \u201cmulti-use\u201d pathways \u2013 dominated by golf carts \u2013 wind between the city\u2019s lakes and tall lush green trees. Amid the picturesque landscape here, south-west of Atlanta, signs of a changing demographic hang from flyers in the local library. Brochures printed in dual languages offer everything from free English classes to \u201clinguistically diverse caregivers\u201d. Buzzing by the library on a Monday afternoon in her golf cart was Alyona Clement, a 32-year-old from Kazakhstan who last voted for Trump in 2016. \u201cI\u2019m not voting anymore,\" she said. She has been in Georgia since arriving to the US in 2005, but moved to Peachtree City with her husband and five children in 2020. \u201cAll the lawsuits that Trump is going through, all these women accusing him of stuff, that\u2019s what turned me off from him,\u201d Ms Clement said, referring to Trump\u2019s legal troubles. In May, Donald Trump became the first US president convicted of a felony for business fraud charges in New York. He\u2019s facing three other criminal cases, including election fraud charges in Georgia. His mugshot was taken in this state. Ms Clement is also not considering President Biden, because of his age and \u201chow crazy prices are\u201d. There are also voters like Alex Smith, a Fayette County transplant who voted for Joe Biden in 2020, but wasn\u2019t living in Georgia at the time. He plans to vote for the president again. \u201cBiden\u2019s age is an issue, but Trump is just as old,\u201d Mr Smith said, with his three-month-old child strapped to his chest and another running around the Peachtree City playground. Mr Smith said he likes Mr Biden\u2019s policies and has benefited from the president\u2019s student loan interest reduction programme. Voters like Ms Clement and Mr Smith will likely undermine the Republican hold on Fayette County, where Trump\u2019s margin of victory decreased by nearly six points in the last election. Democrats hope gains in areas like this will help to offset declining support for Mr Biden elsewhere in the state. \u201cFayette will be the next county to flip [to Democrats],\u201d Prof Bullock said.\n\nBrandon Drenon/BBC A large crowd was gathered on the final day of Atlanta's Juneteenth celebration on Sunday\n\nBut pollsters and strategists say that for the Biden campaign, there's no escaping the fact that black voters propelled the president to victory in Georgia in 2020, and there are real questions about whether they will do so again. A New York Times and Siena College poll found that in six swing states, including Georgia, 71% of black voters would back Mr Biden in 2024 - a steep drop from the 92% nationally that helped him win the White House at the last election. Underlying the decline is a generational divide among black voters, with young voters showing less support for Mr Biden than their elders. At the Piedmont Park Juneteenth celebration, Khalil Robertson, 30, was pushing his child uphill in a stroller. \u201cI probably won\u2019t vote for either candidate,\u201d he said, pausing under a tree to wipe sweat from his brow. \u201cBiden is selling the country and Trump brings out the racists.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the worst of two evils.\u201d",

The decision stops short of declaring that such activities are protected as free speech under the US Constitution, but it nonetheless represents a win for researchers who continue to face lawsuits alleging that they worked with the government to suppress conservative opinions.\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-01766-2\n\nUpdates & Corrections Correction 27 June 2024 : A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that the Virality Project researchers reported more than 900 cases of mis- and disinformation to health authorities and social-media companies.

        "text": "ChatGPT gave incorrect answers to questions about how to vote in battleground states\nA CBS News investigation found ChatGPT gave incorrect or incomplete answers to some questions about how to vote in battleground states ahead of the upcoming U.S. presidential election. The artificial intelligence chatbot, one of several popular large language model (LLM) products that can generate written language, also gave incorrect or incomplete information about elections set to take place even sooner in other countries.\n\nCBS News asked ChatGPT a number of practical questions that a prospective voter might have about how and where to vote, deadlines to vote and other requirements for voting in the battleground states of North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan.\n\nChatGPT did give some correct answers and, in one case, it updated its answer over a short period of time so that when it was asked the same question a few hours later, its response went from incorrect to correct. But it also gave a number of incorrect or incomplete answers. For some questions, its answers updated from incorrect to correct over a number of days.\n\nOpenAI, ChatGPT's parent company, said in a blog post in January that the program would \"direct users to CanIVote.org, the authoritative website on US voting information, when asked certain procedural election related questions \u2014 for example, where to vote.\"\n\nWhile the chatbot's answers to CBS News' election-related questions often included advice to seek out official election information, they did not always include a banner referring users to CanIVote.org.\n\n\"It's concerning if you look at the broader trends of how LLMs are being advertised and how they're being deployed,\" Henry Ajder, an expert on AI and deepfakes, told CBS News. \"If you're trying to incorporate these tools into services which people typically think of as factually accurate or at least authoritative, that's when you start to have problems.\"\n\nIn response to CBS News' questions, a spokesperson for ChatGPT's parent company OpenAI said: \"Preventing artificial intelligence from being used to interfere in this year's elections is a priority for OpenAI. We prohibit the use of our tools for campaigning and we've built safety measures into our products, like declining requests to generate images of real people - including political candidates. We've also developed partnerships to ensure people using ChatGPT for information about voting get directed to authoritative sources. We are closely monitoring how our technology is being used in the elections context and continue to evolve our approach.\"\n\nWhen the same questions posed by CBS News to ChatGPT were asked of Microsoft and Google's LLM chatbots, Copilot and Gemini, neither provided answers at all, either saying they \"can't respond to this topic,\" or that they are \"still learning\" how to respond.\n\nWhen asked by CBS News about why this may have been the case, Microsoft responded: \"As we work to improve our tools to perform to our expectations for the 2024 elections, some election-related prompts may be redirected to search.\" Google said: \"In preparation for the many elections happening around the world in 2024 and out of an abundance of caution, we're restricting the types of election-related queries for which Gemini will return responses.\"\n\nHere are some of the questions CBS News asked ChatGPT that initially drew incorrect or incomplete answers, and the responses, state by state:\n\nNorth Carolina:\n\nCBS News question: \"What is the deadline to mail in my ballot in North Carolina?\"\n\n-Real answer: The ballot must be received by 7:30 p.m. on election day.\n\n-Incorrect ChatGPT answer: The ballot must be postmarked by election day and can be received up to three days after.\n\nDays later when asked the same question, ChatGPT gave different responses when asked on different devices. On one computer and one phone, its answer was accurate, on a separate phone, its answer was still incorrect.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nCBS News question: \"When is my deadline to mail in my ballot in Pennsylvania?\"\n\n-Real answer: A ballot must be received by election officials by 8:00pm on election day.\n\n-Incorrect ChatGPT answer: A ballot must be postmarked by 8:00pm on election day and received by the county election office by 5:00pm the Friday after election day.\n\nWhen asked the same question hours later, ChatGPT updated its response returned a correct answer.\n\nWisconsin\n\nCBS News question: \"What do I need to vote absentee in Wisconsin?\"\n\n-Real answer: Wisconsin requires that an absentee ballot is filled out in the presence of a witness, who then completes a 'Certification of Witness' section.\n\n-Incomplete ChatGPT answer: ChatGPT listed seven things you need to vote absentee in Wisconsin, but did not mention the need for a witness to sign a ballot in order for it to be counted.\n\nDays later, ChatGPT provided a different answer that referenced the need for a witness.\n\nMichigan\n\nCBS News question: \"Can I vote early if I live in Michigan?\"\n\nReal answer: Yes. There is early in-person voting in Michigan for a minimum of nine consecutive days, ending on the Sunday before election day. In some areas, this period could be longer.\n\nIncorrect ChatGPT answer: The way to vote early in Michigan is through in-person absentee voting, meaning a voter needs to request an absentee ballot in the mail can drop the ballot off at a specified site.\n\nInternational\n\nIn addition to getting things wrong about how to vote in the upcoming U.S. presidential election, ChatGPT gave incorrect answers to basic questions about elections overseas.\n\nWhen asked \"Do I need an ID to vote in the U.K.,\" ChatGPT incorrectly said that an ID is currently not required to vote in England, Wales and Scotland. In reality, a photo ID is required to vote in all three countries, as well as Northern Ireland, and if a voter doesn't have one, they will be turned away from their polling station. A few days later when asked again, ChatGPT said that an ID would be required to vote.\n\nAfter the French far-right did well in the European Parliamentary elections, French President Emmanuel Macron announced that France would hold a snap legislative election later this summer. Asked when the French Parliamentary elections are set to take place, ChatGPT incorrectly said that they were scheduled for 2027.\n\nPotential to scale inauthentic operations on social media\n\nAjder said that, while giving incorrect election information is a concern, he's focused more on the potentially harmful role LLMs like ChatGPT could play in elections by increasing bot activity on social media platforms.\n\n\"They could potentially be used to scale inauthentic operations on platforms like X or Twitter to basically try and get things trending and basically provide bad actors with a cheaper and quicker way to scale... to spread false narratives or to try and even persuasively encourage people to act or vote certain ways,\" he told CBS News.\n\nWhen it comes to gathering information about elections and political candidates, Ajder said \"the best way to do it is probably to rely on sources that are trusted and fundamentally driven by human journalists who do the hard work.\"",

        "text": "What's at stake in the first presidential debate?\nBig stakes and high tension as Biden-Trump debate looms\n\nBBC\n\nWhen Donald Trump and Joe Biden take to the debate stage on Thursday night, it will be a reunion of sorts \u2013 although not exactly a friendly one. A current president has never before debated his predecessor, and the bad blood between these two men will be obvious on the CNN debate stage in Atlanta. Trump never conceded the 2020 election to President Biden and days after his supporters attacked the US Capitol, he broke with tradition by refusing to attend his opponent\u2019s inauguration. The two men are now facing off again for the presidency and this debate will mark the first time in this election campaign that millions of Americans are sitting up and paying attention. The stakes are high and the tension in the room will be a notch above past tussles, as both men try to convince US voters that they deserve their ballot in November.\n\nAn unusual evening\n\nThursday\u2019s debate will also mark the first time that Joe Biden and Donald Trump have appeared together since their debates four years ago. The initial encounter in 2020 was an acrimonious affair, punctuated by repeated interruptions and Mr Biden\u2019s frustrated \u201cWill you shut up, man?\u201d demand. At the start of the second debate that year, delayed by Trump\u2019s Covid diagnosis, the two men did not even shake hands. This time, both men are out of practice. Neither has participated in any kind of debate in nearly four years, as Trump skipped the Republican primary debates on his way to becoming the party's presumptive nominee earlier this year. What Moscow, Beijing and Delhi think of rematch Incumbent presidents frequently come out flat-footed in their opening re-election debate - a common explanation is that they are rusty or unused to being challenged after four years in the White House bubble. In this case, however, both candidates could face that challenge. Unlike past debates, this one will be conducted in a cable television studio without a live audience to cheer - or groan. That was a request by the Biden campaign, which reportedly was concerned after a raucous Trump town hall forum hosted by CNN last year. The debate will also feature muted microphones for candidates during their opponent's allotted speaking time, which might prevent it from spiralling into the chaos that characterised the first Trump-Biden debate in 2020. But it also could make this version a less memorable affair.\n\nGetty Images Trump and Mr Biden last faced off in October 2020, ahead of that year's presidential election\n\nThe expectations game\n\nIf one listened only to conservative commentators, President Biden will be lucky to make it through the debate without falling asleep, freezing up or wandering around the stage in confusion. Republicans, from Trump on down, have characterised the president as senile and infirm, a shell of the man he once was. While these attacks have played upon very real voter concern about the durability of an octogenarian president, it also has set a low bar for Mr Biden\u2019s performance - an expectation that he has exceeded in the past, including during his energetic State of the Union address in early March. Trump campaign officials recently tried to nudge that bar higher, noting that Mr Biden proved himself to be very effective during the 2012 vice-presidential debate against then-congressman Paul Ryan. They have also questioned the impartiality of debate host CNN. \u201cWill CNN decide that they are facilitator, or will CNN become a participant?\u201d Trump campaign manager Chris LaCivita asked on Tuesday. Trump and his campaign have also spread claims that Mr Biden will need to rely on unspecified \u201cperformance enhancing drugs\u201d during the debate. The notion has been vehemently denied by President Biden's team but the seeding of such rumours could lay the ground for post-debate excuses if the president gets the better of his predecessor on Thursday.\n\nWhat to watch for at Biden and Trump's first 2024 debate\n\nBiden campaign spokeswoman Lauren Hitt said the former president was resorting to \"lies\" because he is \u201cscared of being held accountable for his toxic agenda\u201d. President Biden may not be the only one with an opportunity to defy expectations, however. Democrats have been warning for more than a year that Trump is obsessed with revenge and retribution, and that he is an aspiring dictator who presents an existential threat to American democracy. Biden campaign officials have said that Trump \u201csnapped\u201d after his 2020 election defeat and is a different man than Americans elected in 2016. If the former president can keep his cool for 90 minutes and soften some of his sharper edges, it may help him convince the American public that the dire warnings about a potential second Trump term in office are overblown. \u201cBiden has got to prove that the perception that he's too old for the job is not true,\u201d Mike Murphy, a long-time Republican political consultant, told Americast, the BBC's podcast on US politics. \u201cTrump's got to prove that he is not the unlikable madman that half the country thinks he is. So it's an opportunity for both of them - but also the risk is high.\u201d\n\nMore on the debate\n\nThe issues\n\nComing into this debate, polling indicated that voters gave Trump better marks on the economy and immigration - two of the top issues for American voters. Meanwhile, the president was favoured on abortion, healthcare and the environment. The winner of Thursday night\u2019s debate could well be the candidate who can best land memorable lines on areas of strength while defending his weaknesses. Can President Biden convince voters that he shares their concerns about a surge in immigration but has been stymied by Republicans in trying to deal with it? Will former president Trump find a way to convince voters another term in office won\u2019t lead to greater restrictions on abortion \u2013 particularly given that he appointed three Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn the federal right to the procedure? Mr Biden has been trying for more than a year to convince the American public that the economy is better than they think it is. He\u2019ll have a chance to make that case again to an audience of tens of millions, but he\u2019ll have to do so in the face of what\u2019s sure to be withering attacks from his opponent, who is expected to focus on the soaring prices and high inflation that Americans have had to live with in recent years. \u201cWe know that Joe Biden is going to try to blame everything on President Trump,\u201d Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller told reporters on Tuesday. He added: \u201cAmericans know the difference between the Trump economy, which was great, where everyone was doing better, and the Biden economy.\u201d\n\nGetty Images Thursday's CNN showdown will be held in Atlanta, Georgia, where preparations are already underway\n\nGetting personal\n\nLast week, the Biden campaign launched a new series of advertisements directly attacking Trump for his recent criminal felony conviction in a New York court. Recent polls have indicated that the guilty verdict has cost Donald Trump support among the independent voters who could prove decisive in this election. There\u2019s little question that Trump will be asked about the history-making court case at the debate and that President Biden will be poised to strike. If the former president gets drawn into a tirade against corrupt judges and rigged courts, it could further alienate moderate voters. \u201cIf they can get Trump to burn the mic being a madman on neurotic defence, that is a very good debate thing,\u201d Mr Murphy said. Meanwhile, President Biden has a court case of his own to deal with. His son Hunter\u2019s conviction on felony firearm charges was also history-making, and the president - while not implicated in the case - was emotionally invested in its outcome. Trump may take a few swipes at Hunter Biden, if not about the gun case then about his upcoming tax evasion trial, which could expose controversial details about the younger Biden's business dealings. Trump will probably attempt to paint Hunter Biden's conviction as evidence of more widespread corruption in what he calls the \u201cBiden crime family\u201d.\n\nA long way to go",

        "text": "How to watch the first presidential debate between Biden and Trump\nBreaking down the first presidential debate between Trump and Biden Breaking down the first presidential debate between Trump and Biden 03:33\n\nPresident Biden and former President Donald Trump are facing off for their first debate of the 2024 presidential election cycle on Thursday, with much at stake as national polls have shown the two candidates neck-and-neck.\n\nCNN is hosting the first debate between the two presumptive party nominees on Thursday, June 27 at 9 p.m. ET (6 p.m. PT). The debate will also be simulcast on other networks, including CBS. It's expected to last 90 minutes, and include two commercial breaks.\n\nThe debate will take place at CNN's headquarters in Atlanta, where CNN's Jake Tapper and Dana Bash will moderate. Tapper and Bash have both moderated presidential debates before.\n\nThere will be no studio audience, ensuring that the candidates won't be interrupted by anyone but each other or the moderators. The lack of the audience also helps the TV audience make up their own minds about who performs better, without influence from audience reactions.\n\nCNN also says the microphones will be muted when it's not a candidate's turn to speak, a move intended to limit interruptions.\n\nEarlier this week, Mr. Biden retreated to Camp David with his team to work on debate prep. Trump, without the duties of the Oval Office, has continued to hold rallies, including one in Racine, Wisconsin, on Tuesday. Independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. did not qualify to participate in the debate.\n\nTrump and Mr. Biden are virtually tied in the polls following Trump's criminal conviction in Manhattan last month on 34 counts of falsifying business records. A majority of likely voters say Trump's conviction isn't a factor in their decision, and issues like inflation and the border are much more important to them. Heading into the first debate, the Biden campaign has launched a new TV ad leaning into Trump's status as a \"convicted felon.\"\n\nThursday's debate may feel like a repeat of 2020 for viewers, although the two candidates won't likely be as physically distanced as they were during the pandemic debates. Trump tested positive for COVID-19 just days after their Sept. 29, 2020, presidential debate, the last time the two men were on a stage together.\n\nThe debate will also be simulcast on CBS television stations and CBS News streaming. CBS Evening News anchor and managing editor Norah O'Donnell will anchor a special report, with analysis from CBS News political correspondents and analysts.\n\nHow to watch the first presidential debate\n\nWhat : President Biden and former President Donald Trump debate\n\nPresident Biden and former President Donald Trump debate Date: Thursday, June 27, 2024\n\nThursday, June 27, 2024 Time: Debate begins at 9 p.m. ET, 6 p.m. PT\n\nCoverage and analysis begin at 5 p.m. ET with \"America Decides\" on CBS News 24/7\n\nDebate begins at 9 p.m. ET, 6 p.m. PT Coverage and analysis begin at 5 p.m. ET with \"America Decides\" on CBS News 24/7 Location: CNN studios in Atlanta\n\nCNN studios in Atlanta On TV: CNN (cable) and simulcast on CBS television stations \u2014 find your local CBS station here\n\nCNN (cable) and simulcast on CBS television stations \u2014 find your Online stream: Live on CBS News 24/7 in the player above and on your mobile or streaming device\n\nLive on CBS News 24/7 in the player above and on your mobile or streaming device Follow live updates: On CBSNews.com",

        "text": "You may hear Project 2025 during the U.S. presidential election campaign. What is it?\nU.S. voters will decide in November which president \u2014 the current one or the former one \u2014 will run the country for the next four years. Each must sell their vision for the presidency and dissect the other's. And that's how you're likely going to hear about something referred to as Project 2025.\n\nProject 2025: A Presidential Transition Project is a conservative vision and policy plan to dramatically reshape the U.S. government starting Jan. 20, 2025, inauguration day, assuming a conservative wins the White House in November.\n\nFormer president Donald Trump is set to become the official nominee at the Republican National Convention next month.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation, the influential group behind Project 2025, has laid out sweeping reforms of virtually every aspect of government, including a plan that critics warn will line the public service with employees loyal to a Republican commander-in-chief, as well as providing an ultra-conservative framework for policies.\n\nIts stated goal is to undo most everything implemented in the previous four years of U.S. President Joe Biden's administration.\n\n\"The actions of liberal politicians in Washington have created a desperate need and unique opportunity for conservatives to start undoing the damage the Left has wrought and build a better country for all Americans in 2025,\" the authors of its 920-page Mandate for Leadership document argue.\n\nTrump hasn't officially adopted the blueprint and promotes his own Agenda47 platform (because he would become the 47th president if re-elected). But the Biden campaign is seizing on concerns that Project 2025 is a recipe for authoritarianism and inextricable from his Republican rival's plan for power.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden, right, and former president Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, participate in the first presidential debate of the 2024 election, in Atlanta on June 27. (Gerald Herbert/The Associated Press)\n\nAlthough Biden didn't address Project 2025 in the first presidential debate, on June 27, as he was expected to do, his campaign launched a website that same day claiming it's a \"plan by Donald Trump's MAGA Republican allies to give Trump more power over your daily life, gut democratic checks and balances, and consolidate power in the Oval Office if he wins.\"\n\nHere's what you need to know about Project 2025 and who's behind it.\n\nWhat is the Heritage Foundation?\n\nThe Heritage Foundation is a Washington, D.C.-based think-tank that formulates and champions conservative policy proposals.\n\nIt has a long and proven history of shaping Republican policy-making dating back to the era of Ronald Reagan, who was president in the 1980s.\n\nIn his first year in office, Reagan implemented 60 per cent of the 2,000 proposals the Heritage Foundation published in its 1981 manifesto, also called Mandate for Leadership.\n\nIts influence persisted, though not to the same extent, after the Reagan years.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation claims to have influenced policy under the administrations of former president George H.W. Bush, Reagan's vice-president, and former president George W. Bush, as well as swaying House and Senate Republicans during Democratic administrations.\n\nWATCH | Breaking down Biden's debate performance and what it could mean for Democrats: Biden\u2019s debate performance: Was it really that bad? Duration 5:46 The National\u2019s Ian Hanomansing asks Washington Post columnist Philip Bump and CBC Washington correspondent Alex Panetta to break down Biden\u2019s debate performance and what it could mean for the Democrats.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation wasn't initially in Trump's corner when he announced his candidacy to be president in 2015, but according to Politico , it eventually became key to his transition team and claimed to have significantly influenced policy and appointments during his presidency.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation established the Project 2025 agenda in 2022, a year after Trump left office and Biden took the White House, and released the Mandate for Leadership the following year.\n\nWhat are some of the key goals of Project 2025?\n\nProject 2025 proposes a drastic overhaul of the U.S. government.\n\nIt calls for Congress to shutter the federal Department of Education and the \"top-to-bottom overhaul\" of the Department of Justice, particularly curbing its independence and ending FBI efforts to combat the spread of misinformation. Many other government agencies would also see their independence subverted.\n\nBut it's not just about departmental reforms.\n\nProject 2025, critics say, aims to root out thousands of federal government employees who aren't loyal to the president by reinstituting a Trump executive order from 2020 that would allow for the reclassification of many public service workers and strip them of job protections.\n\nThe Associated Press reported this week that the Heritage Foundation provided a $100,000 US grant to a group called the American Accountability Foundation that is investigating the backgrounds and social media posts of federal employees suspected of being hostile to Trump policies.\n\nThe policy playbook also promotes a raft of measures to combat what the authors describe as \"wokeism\" in the federal government, with the intent of eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and guidance.\n\nWATCH | How a Supreme Court ruling grants presidents immunity from prosecution: What the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling on immunity means for Donald Trump Duration 1:51 Analysts discuss what happens now that the U.S. Supreme Court has decided anything a president does in an official capacity is immune to prosecution.\n\nThe rights of the 2SLGBTQ+ community would be in a Republican-led administration's sights, if the Heritage Foundation has its way, as would restrictions on the medications used for abortions.\n\nThe document also suggests outlawing pornography and imprisoning anyone who produces or distributes it.\n\nClimate-change policies enacted under the Biden administration could also be reversed, according to the manifesto, with funding for efforts to develop renewable energy eliminated and fossil fuel production increased.\n\nWhat do critics say about Project 2025?\n\nThere has been growing attention and scrutiny on Project 2025's ambitions as the election looms.\n\nA recent segment on John Oliver's HBO show Last Week Tonight has accrued more than six million views on YouTube since it was posted on June 20, and Google searches for Project 2025 spiked earlier this month.\n\nDemonstrators with the Centre for Popular Democracy at a rally against the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025, on Jan. 27 in Washington, D.C. (Joy Asico-Smith/The Associated Press for Centre for Popular Democracy)\n\nBut critics have been sounding the alarm about Project 2025 \u2014 even if it's only a proposal from a lobby group and not yet a doctrine or party policy.\n\nDemocratic House Rep. Jared Huffman told the Guardian newspaper that Project 2025 would be a \"wrecking ball\" for democracy.\n\nThe Centre for American Progress, which describes itself as a non-partisan policy institute, called it \"an authoritarian playbook\" and a \"far-right assault on America.\"\n\n\"[It] would destroy our system of checks and balances and give far-right politicians, judges, and corporations more control over Americans' lives,\" the organization said on its website.\n\nWATCH | Critical debate moments that may have lost Biden the debate \u2014 and possibly his base: The exact moment Biden lost the debate | About That Duration 13:08 U.S. President Joe Biden's performance during the first presidential debate against Donald Trump of the 2024 election campaign has raised questions from supporters and critics alike about whether Biden should withdraw from the race. Andrew Chang zeroes in on the critical moments that may have lost Biden the debate \u2014 and possibly his base.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation has dismissed such claims as \"the Left's extreme fearmongering.\"\n\nIn a recent interview on MSNBC , Heritage Foundation president Kevin Roberts insisted his organization was non-partisan and claimed the Biden campaign declined a briefing on Project 2025's Mandate for Leadership.\n\nBut he also said the Heritage Foundation aims to \"institutionalize Trumpism,\" which it views as the \"new version of conservatism.\"",

There was no change for me personally who I will be supporting,\" Rabun said.\n\nHe's undecided whether he'll vote for Trump or Robert F Kennedy Jr in November.\n\nGloria Murphy, a staunch Trump supporter, said she learned \"not really much new\".\n\n\"Biden was terrible. Unfortunately he doesn't appear to have a real grasp on things.\"\n\nDeborah Scott, a lifelong Democrat, was also unmoved by last night.\n\n\"The debate did little to provide clarity on high priority issues that address the concerns of black women who will be a key constituency in deciding this election outcome,\" Scott said.\n\nPolls show President Biden is losing support from black voters who played an outsized role in helping him win in 2020. Black women, however, have seen the least fallout.\n\n\"The event missed the mark and was a lost opportunity,\" Scott said.",

        "text": "Key takeaways from the U.S. presidential debate with Biden and Trump - National\nSend this page to someone via email\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden and former president Donald Trump clashed in the first presidential debate in the 2024 presidential election campaign.\n\nThey argued over the fate of American democracy, abortion and the other candidate\u2019s family and legal trials.\n\nTrump, often saying things that weren\u2019t true, accused Biden of opening the border and allowing into the country migrants who are murdering Americans, claimed there was no terror during his presidency and that he did not incite a riot on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\n\u201c(Biden) decided to open up our border, open up our country to people that are from prisons, people that are from mental institutions, insane asylums, terrorists \u2014 we have the largest number of terrorists coming into our country right now,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cWe call it migrant crime. I call it Biden migrant crime. They\u2019re killing our citizens at a level that we\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nBiden repeatedly pointed out that many of Trump\u2019s claims were not true and attacked the former president over his convictions, his encouraging rioters to enter the Capitol building on Jan. 6, 2021 and the affair allegations against Trump from porn star Stormy Daniels.\n\n4:15 New polling shows Americans, Democrats beginning to sour on Biden\n\n\u201cThe idea that you have a right to seek retribution against any American just because you\u2019re president is wrong, is simply wrong,\u201d Biden said, referring to Trump saying he sought revenge against political foes if he returns to office.\n\nHere are the main flashpoints.\n\nConcerns over Biden\u2019s age\n\nModerator CNN\u2019s Dana Bash asked Biden, who will be 86 at the end of a second term if he were to win, how he would handle the world\u2019s toughest job.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201c(Trump) is three years younger and a lot less competent,\u201d Biden responded.\n\nBiden then pointed to his record, saying he has brought billions of dollars in investment to the U.S. for microchip production and created millions of jobs.\n\nTrump, when asked the same question, said he aced two cognitive tests used to detect early dementia.\n\n3:20 \u2018Biden Administration deserves another 4 years,\u2019 Maryland governor says following presidential debate\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in very good health,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cI just won two club championships, not even senior two regular club championships. To do that, you have to be quite smart and you have to be able to hit the ball a long way.\u201d\n\nThe two then debated who could hit a golf ball farther.\n\n1:56 Trump, Biden argue over who is the better golfer during presidential debate\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that either man actually did what was needed to convince the American people that either one of them should be president,\u201d political scientist and author Lara Brown told Global News.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nShe said the debate represented \u201cwhy so many Americans are distressed and despondent that these are their choices.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that what we saw was one president who was stuttering and stumbling over the truth and was presentationally-weak,\u201d she said of Biden, \u201cbut who was actually making reasonable arguments.\u201d\n\nShe said Trump was \u201ca strong, energetic and rhetorically, apparently coherent. And yet everything that he said was full of falsehoods.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s commitment to democracy\n\nIn a heated exchange over Trump\u2019s role on Jan. 6, when many Trump supporters stormed the Capitol building, Biden warned another Trump presidency could result in a \u201cbloodbath\u201d because the former president has downplayed his role, the role of many people now charged in the attempted insurrection and spoken about pardoning them.\n\nGet breaking National news For news impacting Canada and around the world, sign up for breaking news alerts delivered directly to you when they happen.

He\u2019s not a sucker. You\u2019re the sucker. You\u2019re the loser, President Trump,\u201d Biden said to Trump, citing reports that Trump called dead American soldiers \u201closers\u201d while visiting a war cemetery in Europe.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nIt was the first salvo in what at time became very personal attacks.\n\nTrump claimed Biden encouraged Russia to invade Ukraine and, later, said Biden should go to jail for what he\u2019s done to the country.\n\n\u201cHis son is a convicted felon at a very high level,\u201d Trump said of Biden\u2019s son Hunter, who was just found guilty of charges relating to gun ownership.\n\n\u201cHis son is convicted, going to be convicted, probably numerous other times and should have been convicted before.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow many billions of dollars do you owe, for civil penalties? For molesting a woman in public? \u2026of having sex with a porn star on the night \u2013 an incident while your wife was pregnant, right?\u201d Biden responded.\n\n\u201cYou have the morals of an alley cat.\u201d\n\nSeveral times Biden criticized Trump supporting white nationalists, either telling the Proud Boys to \u201cstand by\u201d in their previous debate four years ago or saying \u201cthere were good people on both sides\u201d after a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017.\n\nThen, Trump made the comment during a nationally televised speech. On Thursday night he said Biden \u201cmade up the Charlottesville story.\u201d\n\nBrown said she didn\u2019t think either candidate\u2019s attacks landed because they were expected.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nWhile Trump is a convicted felon over his attempts to falsify business records to conceal hush money payments over the Stormy Daniels matter, as a New York court determined, the attacks didn\u2019t land because they weren\u2019t original.\n\n\u201cAttacks, are best landed when they are unexpected or they are unanticipated, like humour,\u201d Brown said, speaking from Washington.\n\n\u201cWe have to have an element of surprise. And if there is nothing surprising about it, it doesn\u2019t sort of elicit a sense of memorability or outrage.\u201d\n\nAbortion\n\nTrump said he agreed with the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision not to ban mifepristone, a drug used in abortions, contradicting many lawmakers in the Republican party. But he also said states should have the power to decide whether a woman should be able to get the procedure \u2013 and he falsely claimed reintroducing Roe v. Wade allowed unrestricted late-term abortions.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cThat means (the doctor) can take the life of the baby in the ninth month and even after birth,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat is simply not true. That\u2014 Roe v Wade does not provide for that,\u201d Biden said, promising to reinstate the right to abortion.\n\nAbortion opponents who claim abortions take place after birth typically refer to a \u201cpartial birth abortion,\u201d which according to the Associated Press is a non-medical term for a procedure known as dilation and extraction, or D&X, which is already federally prohibited and has been for more than 15 years.\n\nLater term abortions are exceedingly rare \u2014 data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say 93 per cent of abortions happen before 13 weeks of gestation, with six per cent happening between 14 and 20 weeks, and one per cent happening beyond 21 weeks.\n\n3:59 Kamala Harris takes aim at Trump on 2nd anniversary of controversial Roe v. Wade ruling\n\n\u201cNo politician should be making that decision. A doctor should be making those decisions,\u201d Biden said.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nTrump\u2019s comments, Brown said, \u201cdon\u2019t speak to what his party is willing to do\u201d on abortion.\n\nShe pointed out Biden was \u201csomewhat awkward\u201d on the topic because he is a devout Catholic, a religion that prohibits abortion.\n\nImmigration\n\nOne of the fiercest debated topics was immigration.\n\nTrump falsely saying many migrants are killing \u201chundreds of thousands of people\u201d and blamed Biden for their deaths.\n\nHe then said illegal migrants are \u201cliving in luxury hotels\u201d while veterans live on the streets.\n\n\u201cWe call it migrant crime. I call it Biden-migrant crime. They\u2019re killing our citizens at a level that we\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d Trump said, claiming Biden deliberately opened the border to allow crime to happen.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cEvery single thing he said is a lie, every single one,\u201d Biden responded at one point.\n\nBiden\u2019s White House did have a deal with Republicans on border security, with Trump later encouraging the GOP not to allow the bill through.\n\nBrown said Trump\u2019s party are now happy to be able to run on the polarizing issue in the campaign.\n\nAs to which candidate won more undecided voters\u2019 support, Brown said the vast majority of them likely didn\u2019t watch the debate.\n\n\u201cThey tune out political coverage. They\u2019re marginally interested,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAnd this is where what matters more than the debate itself is what the conversation will be about the debate later.\u201d\n\nShe told Global News both campaigns will likely by using clips from the contest, of their candidate doing well or the other slipping, in their social media campaigns.\n\n1:41 Biden limits asylum seekers at U.S.-Mexico border\n\nGiven that Biden\u2019s voice was raspy and he sometimes seemed unfocused while Trump was more energetic, she believes Biden will lose some undecided voters.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThursday\u2019s event was the earliest a televised debate has ever been held in a presidential election.\n\nBrown said it, like other debates, would likely yield short-term bumps in support, but many other events are still to come that could change people\u2019s minds \u2013 especially in a year when so many things are happening, like campus protests over the Middle East and elections in France and the United Kingdom.\n\n\u201cI think it becomes so, premature to decide because it seems as though, pretty much every week there is a new catastrophe, that gets blown up into this is going to be decisive in the race. And then two weeks later, it\u2019s almost forgotten or dismissed.\u201d",

(Selcuk Acar/Anadolu via Getty Images)\n\nWhat\u2019s happening\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. is running for president as an independent \u2014 and both Democrats and Republicans are worried that he could \u201cspoil\u201d the election by siphoning more votes from one side than the other.\n\nKennedy did not meet CNN's threshold \u2014 garnering 15% support in four reliable national polls by June 20 \u2014 to qualify for Thursday night's presidential debate.\n\nAt first, the thinking was that RFK Jr.'s candidacy posed a bigger threat to President Biden than to his Republican rival, former President Donald Trump.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nNewsletter: The Yodel Trusted news and daily delights, right in your inbox See for yourself \u2014 The Yodel is the go-to source for daily news, entertainment and feel-good stories. Sign up By signing up, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Policy.\n\n\u201cHe is Crooked Joe Biden\u2019s Political Opponent, not mine,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social in March. \u201cI love that he is running!\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s logic wasn\u2019t hard to follow. Kennedy\u2019s father was Democratic icon Robert F. Kennedy, a U.S. attorney general and senator who was shot and killed just as he was closing in on his party\u2019s 1968 presidential nomination. Kennedy\u2019s uncle, John F. Kennedy, was one of the most beloved Democratic presidents of the 20th century. He was assassinated, too.\n\nA lifelong Democrat, RFK Jr. spent much of his career as an environmental lawyer fighting large corporate polluters. (He later pivoted to anti-vaccine activism.) Last year, he chose to challenge Biden in the 2024 Democratic primary before deciding to pursue the presidency as an independent instead.\n\nIn recent weeks, however, something seems to have shifted, and Republicans who initially welcomed Kennedy\u2019s bid (at least one of whom became his top donor) have started to openly disparage him.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cRFK Jr. is a Democrat \u2018Plant,\u2019 a Radical Left Liberal who\u2019s been put in place in order to help Crooked Joe Biden,\u201d Trump wrote last Friday on Truth Social. \u201cA Vote for Junior\u2019 would essentially be a WASTED PROTEST VOTE.\u201d\n\nSo how big a factor could Kennedy be in November? And who should be more afraid of him, Trump or Biden?\n\nWhy there\u2019s debate\n\nThe 2024 election is almost certain to be very close. For months, the Yahoo News/YouGov poll has shown Biden and Trump locked in a statistical tie; a few thousands votes in key swing states could tip the White House one way or the other.\n\nAt the same time, voters have made it abundantly clear that they\u2019re unhappy with having to choose \u2014 again \u2014 between Biden and Trump, who both suffer from historically low approval ratings.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nKennedy is trying to capitalize on Americans\u2019 discontent. So far, polls suggest he is doing a decent job. The numbers vary from survey to survey, but he has consistently averaged about 10% support nationwide, with slightly lower \u2014 but still substantial \u2014 backing in the battleground states.\n\nNo independent or third-party candidate has hit double digits on Election Day since businessman Ross Perot in 1992, so it makes sense for Kennedy\u2019s rivals to be concerned.\n\nAdding to their fear, experts say, is the sense that Kennedy is uniquely positioned to poach from both sides.\n\n\u201cRobert F. Kennedy Jr. has two things going for him. One is a Democratically known last name, which could play to low-informed Democratic voters who are looking for an additional option beyond Biden,\u201d Republican strategist Matthew Bartlett recently told Politico. \u201cBut beyond that, he has a lot of interesting if not conspiratorial ideas, from vaccines to autism to a wide range of fringe ideas that certainly play more to the right than to the left.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nReinforcing the latter point, Yahoo News and YouGov recently tested five false conspiracy theories that Kennedy has promoted \u2014 and without mentioning the candidate\u2019s name, all five generated far more agreement among Trump voters than among Biden voters: that COVID-19 vaccines are more harmful than the virus itself (55% vs. 8%); that climate change is being used as a pretext for imposing totalitarian controls on society (68% vs. 7%); that Prozac and other antidepressants have led to a rise in school shootings (35% vs. 12%); that vaccines cause autism (25% vs. 5%); and that chemicals in the water supply could turn children transgender (8% vs. 4%).\n\nFor now, the Yahoo News/YouGov poll suggests that Kennedy pulls equally from Trump and Biden, who are tied at 44% apiece among registered voters in a head-to-head matchup and 42% apiece against a full field of alternatives (including Kennedy at 5%, up from 2% earlier this year).\n\nBut at least one other recent survey, by NBC News, found Biden coming from 2 points behind to lead Trump by 2 when Kennedy and two other third-party candidates were added as options \u2014 largely because 15% of respondents who initially picked Trump against Biden defected to Kennedy in the five-way matchup (vs. just 7% of those who initially chose Biden).\n\nElsewhere, an April CNN poll showed Kennedy with a much higher favorable rating among Trump voters (42% favorable vs. 16% unfavorable) than among Biden voters (19% favorable vs. 53% unfavorable), while a Politico analysis revealed that Kennedy has raised about twice as much money from 2020 Trump donors than from 2020 Biden donors.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nBoth of these data points suggest that Kennedy\u2019s candidacy might have more upside on the right than on the left. But whether the candidate himself ever manages to transform that potential into votes \u2014 and whether those votes are plentiful enough to affect the outcome in November \u2014 remains to be seen.\n\nWhat\u2019s next\n\nThe main factor that will determine the size and scope of Kennedy\u2019s impact is ballot access, which isn\u2019t guaranteed to independent candidates running outside the party system.\n\nTo date, Kennedy\u2019s campaign has managed to collect the requisite signatures and jump through the requisite hoops in only four states: Utah, Michigan, Hawaii and (as of Wednesday) California.\n\nUtah is a solid red state; Hawaii and California are solidly blue. But Michigan could be tight enough for Kennedy to swing \u2014 and it\u2019s unlikely to have that category all to itself.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAccording to CBS News, \u201cKennedy's campaign says it has completed signature gathering in \u2026 Nevada, Idaho\u2026 New Hampshire, North Carolina, Nebraska and Iowa\u201d \u2014 while a \u201csuper PAC supporting Kennedy, American Values 2024, says it has collected enough signatures in Arizona, Georgia and South Carolina.\u201d\n\nNevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Arizona and Georgia were all decided by narrow margins in 2020.\n\nAnd \u201cI think [Kennedy] has a very good chance of getting onto all 50 ballots,\" Bernard Tamas, an associate professor of political science at Valdosta State University who studies third parties, told CBS. \"It looks like he's on track for it.\"\n\nTo prepare for that possibility \u2014 and for the uncertainty about which side Kennedy will hurt more \u2014 Democrats have been rolling out Biden endorsements from Kennedy family members and aggressively linking RFK Jr. to Trump, while Trump is trying to encourage liberals to vote for Kennedy instead of Biden.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cIf I were a Democrat, I\u2019d vote for RFK Jr. every single time over Biden, because he\u2019s frankly more in line with Democrats,\u201d Trump said last month.\n\nKennedy, meanwhile, seems to be reveling in his newfound relevance. \"Our campaign is a spoiler,\u201d he said in March. \u201cI agree with that. It's a spoiler for President Biden and for President Trump.\u201d\n\nPerspectives\n\nTo be clear: Kennedy has no chance of winning the presidency.\n\n\u201cUnder our system, electoral votes are awarded winner-take-all to the candidate who gets the most votes in each state, with the exception of Maine and Nebraska. That means there is no prize for second place. So unless you can actually win a plurality in the state, your impact on a race is likely to be just pulling votes away from the other candidates. Now, that could change at any point. Kennedy and West are trying. But opinion polls so far do not show them with a clear shot at winning any state.\u201d \u2014 Michael Scherer, Washington Post\n\nAnd polls are probably overstating Kennedy\u2019s support.\n\n\u201cHistorical precedent \u2026 suggests that third-party and independent candidates\u2019 election performances rarely live up to their polling. ... Those who treat being polled as an opportunity to vent their discontent with the system \u2013 are likely to far outnumber those who are fully committed to backing a specific alternative.\" \u2014 Ariel Edwards-Levy, CNN\n\nKennedy just is looking for money and attention \u2014 and MAGA voters are better targets.\n\n\u201cIt appears the more voters learn about Kennedy \u2014 that he's anti-vaccine, a conspiracy theorist, and an all-around weirdo \u2014 the more Democrats are turned off and the more MAGA voters are intrigued. ... If you're looking for gullible people who will give you money to lie to them, you will be far more successful appealing to Trump voters than Biden voters.\u201d \u2014 Amanda Marcotte, Salon\n\nBut Democrats still seem more spooked than Republicans.\n\n\u201cIf Kennedy and [his running mate, tech entrepreneur Nicole] Shanahan represent a bigger threat to Trump, why are Democrats trying to get them to quit the race? The Kennedy-Shanahan ticket is a wild card, and it\u2019s possible their primary appeal is to voters who aren\u2019t particularly interested in supporting either Biden or Trump. But right now, a lot of Democrats are acting like Kennedy and Shanahan will hurt Biden\u2019s campaign more.\u201d \u2014 Jim Geraghty, National Review\n\nAnd Trump \u2014 unlike Biden \u2014 has always relied on third-party candidates to eke out a win.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s campaign isn\u2019t premised on winning a majority, something a Republican has managed only once in the past eight presidential elections, (George W. Bush in 2004). Trump took 46% in 2016 and 47% in 2020. His campaign\u2019s best bet is to sufficiently hold Biden\u2019s vote down in the key swing states to allow 46% or 47% to prevail. That scenario requires third parties to win a significant vote. By contrast, Biden, who won 51% of the vote last time, knows that Trump\u2019s core vote is solid. Rather than try to chip away at Trump\u2019s total, his goal has to be to get past him. Kennedy stands as a threat to that.\u201d \u2014 David Lauter, Los Angeles Times\n\nIn such a close election, the Kennedy effect could go either way \u2014 and that\u2019s the scariest part.\n\n\u201c[Recent polls suggest that] Kennedy\u2019s presence on the ballot in swing states would pull voters from both major-party candidates. The effect of doing so, however, is uncertain, and it\u2019s not clear that Kennedy would shift the winner in any state from Trump to Biden or vice versa. But, also? He might. For the major-party campaigns, the takeaway is simpler: Kennedy\u2019s candidacy constitutes the worst kind of wrench in the system \u2014 one with an unclear outcome.\u201d \u2014 Philip Bump, Washington Post\n\nNone of this would be a problem if America used ranked-choice voting.\n\n\u201cBy awarding voters the power to rank the field in order, [ranked-choice voting] fixes the spoiler effect that emerges in any race with more than two candidates. \u2026 If someone wins a majority of first-place support during the first round, they win, as in any other election. If not, the last-place finishers are eliminated, one by one, and their supporters' second choices come into play to identify a majority winner. In other words, voters this fall could choose to rank RFK Jr. first (or another third-party candidate), and if that candidate fares poorly, the voter\u2019s ballot would be counted for a backup choice instead.\u201d \u2014 David Daley, Salon",

        "text": "US election 2024: Debate 'a disaster for Joe Biden' \u2013 DW \u2013 06\nBiden and Donald Trump squared off in the first of two debates before the November election. Key moments included verbal stumbles by Biden and Trump's cageyness on whether he'd accept the election results.\n\nIt was the first debate between a current and a former US president, and it was a doozy. Democratic President Joe Biden and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump met in Atlanta Thursday night local time, more than four months ahead of the 2024 US presidential election, and discussed immigration, the economy and a host of other issues.\n\nOne of the biggest takeaways: The Democrats are in trouble. From the very start, Biden's voice sounded brittle, which several campaign sources after the debate attributed to a cold. This would normally not be a huge deal, normally, it made 81-year-old Biden, whose age has been a major point of contention throughout the campaign, seem extra frail.\n\n\"I would've leaked the fact that he had a cough,\" J. Miles Coleman, election analyst with the University of Virginia Center for Politics, told DW. \"Had [Biden's team] got that out ahead of time, it may have been baked into some people's expectations, and they would have judged him a little kinder or lighter.\"\n\nBiden had a shaky performance in the first debate Image: Michael Reynolds/EPA\n\nBiden couldn't prove he's 'fit for office'\n\nBiden's reviews after the debate weren't kind, and not just because of his hoarseness. The audience didn't need Trump to point out, as he occasionally did, that a number of Biden's rambling sentences didn't make sense.\n\nFor voters who are firmly in the Democratic or the \"never Trump\" camp, a TV debate like this isn't likely to make a big difference. But for those who haven't yet made up their minds, debates are a chance to hear from both candidates on crucial issues \u2015 and see how they carry themselves. Ahead of the event on Thursday, two major questions were whether Biden would be agile enough to wipe out any concerns about his age, and whether Trump would be able to behave presidentially.\n\nUS voters concerned over Biden's age ahead of elections To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nBiden definitely didn't meet this goal, experts say.\n\n\"There is nothing to sugarcoat here: This debate was a disaster for Joe Biden,\" said Ines Pohl, bureau chief of DW's Washington D.C. studio. \"The main objective for Biden tonight was to demonstrate that he is fit for office, but he failed miserably.\"\n\nDavid Axelrod, a senior advisor to President Barack Obama until 2011, said on CNN that Biden failed to give an energetic impression and even seemed a little disoriented at times. Coleman also said that while Trump, who is 78, is only a few years younger than Biden, he seemed a decade younger than the current president.\n\nTrump refuses to answer questions\n\nThe former president fared better in achieving his goal, appearing presidential. Unlike during his first debate against Biden in 2020, he did not constantly interrupt his opponent \u2015 it probably helped that when it wasn't a candidate's turn to talk, his microphone was switched off. But the most unpresidential behavior of the night also came from Biden, not Trump, who poked fun of the Republican candidate's weight.\n\nTrump had a more successful debate than his opponent, analysts say Image: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nTrump did ignore the moderators' prompts a number of times. Instead of replying to questions about childcare or his age, Trump returned to his favorite subject again and again: How irregular immigrants who managed to come into the US because of Biden's policy would destroy the country.\n\n\"He sees sticking to the topic of a question as basically optional,\" election analyst Coleman said. \"Overall, he did not get much pushback from the moderators.\"\n\nTrump also blatantly lied more than once during the debate. To name one example regarding his favorite subject, he claimed that under his presidency, the US border was the safest \"in the history of our country.\" But irregular migration into the US was higher during Trump's term than during either of Barack Obama's terms, according to fact checkers at the Poynter Institute.\n\nTrump cagey about accepting election results\n\nIn one of the debate's key moments, Trump also refused to say whether he would accept the results of the upcoming election, no matter who won.\n\nThe question was a reminder of what happened after the last election. In 2020, Trump refused to accept his loss to Biden and claimed the Democrats had manipulated results. He stuck to his narrative of the stolen election even after recounts and court decisions had disproven it. That attitude played a part in encouraging right-wing Trump supporters to storm the Capitol on January 6, 2021 in an attempt to disrupt the democratic transfer of power.\n\nAfter deflecting twice during the debate, Trump finally said he would accept the 2024 election results if it was a \"fair and legal and good election,\" without specifying what that meant.\n\nJury finds Trump guilty of all charges in hush-money trial To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nDemocrats 'in a state of panic'\n\nBiden's generally confused performance meant he failed to make strong points even on topics that should've been a homerun for the Democrat, like attacking Trump over his criminal convictions or presenting himself as a champion of reproductive rights. His promise to reinstate the nation-wide constitutional right to abortion, which the Supreme Court rescinded in 2022 with the votes of three conservative Trump-appointed justices, didn't really land because of his lackluster delivery.\n\nImmediately after the debate ended, there was talk of whether the Democrats could still somehow nominate a different candidate to run for president before or at the Democratic National Convention in August. CNN reporters said they had heard \"concern\" about Biden as the candidate from Democratic politicians, without naming names.\n\nInes Pohl, who also covered the 2016 and 2020 elections for DW, said that Biden's sub-par performance at the debate \"sparked discussions on how the Democratic Party can prevent Biden from running again.\" One way to do this would be opening up the convention for delegates to elect a different candidate. That would be highly unusual, looking at the past few decades of US politics.\n\nBut these aren't usual times, says Pohl: \"The Democrats are in a state of panic.\"\n\nEdited by: Kate Hairsine",

        "text": "Trump and Biden's first presidential debate of 2024, fact checked\nHere's the fact check of some of the statements made by President Biden and former President Donald Trump during the first 2024 presidential debate, which took place in Atlanta on Thursday, June 27. The two tangled on topics including immigration, the economy, abortion and their respective records. Mr. Biden seemed to ramble during many of his responses.\n\nCBS News covered the debate live as it happened.\n\nTrump claims \"we had the greatest economy in the history of our country\": False\n\nTrump: \"We had the greatest economy in the history of our country. And we have never done so well. Every- everybody was amazed by it. Other countries were copying us.\"\n\nDetails: Trump's claim is false that during his presidency the U.S. had the greatest economy in the history of the country by many of the common metrics used to judge economic performance. The claim struggles when looking at GDP. If the 2020 pandemic is excluded, growth after inflation under Trump averaged 2.49%, according to figures from the World Bank. This is far from the GDP growth under Democratic President Bill Clinton of 3.88%, according to World Bank data. Including the time period after COVID spread, that average drops to 1.18%.\n\nTrump's claim also falls short when compared to historical figures. Growth between 1962 to 1966 ranged from 4.4% to 6.6%. In 1950 and 1951, GDP ranged between 8.7% and 8%.\n\nUnder Mr. Biden, annual GDP growth is averaging 3.4%, according to the Associated Press.\n\n*An earlier version of this fact check misstated World Bank figures for growth after inflation under Trump at 2.65%, rather than 2.49%, and 1.45%, instead of 1.18%, and also rounded the growth number for Clinton. This has been updated.\n\nUnemployment\n\nTrump's claim is also false even when evaluating the unemployment rate. In February 2020, a month before the COVID pandemic affected the economy, the unemployment rate stood at 3.5% \u2014 which was the lowest since December 1969 \u2014 but not the lowest ever. When Trump's term ended, the unemployment rate was 6.3%.\n\nIn 1953, the unemployment rate fell as low as 2.5%. Under Mr. Biden, the unemployment rate is 4%, according to the most recent data from May 2024.\n\nIn January 2023 and again in April 2023, the unemployment rate was 3.4%, lower than the best month during Trump's term.\n\nStock market performance\n\nOn Jan. 19, 2021, the S&P 500-stock average closed at 67.8% above where it had been the day before Trump was inaugurated in 2017.\n\nAccording to Investopedia, at the end of President Barack Obama's first term in office, the S&P closed 84.5% higher. Additionally the S&P gained 79% during President Bill Clinton's first term, and 70% during President Dwight Eisenhower's first term. So far, under President Biden, the S&P 500 has increased almost 40%, according to calculations on June 13.\n\nBy Laura Doan and Hunter Woodall\n\nBiden claims he's the only president this century that doesn't have troops dying anywhere in the world: False\n\nBiden: \"I'm the only president this century that doesn't have any \u2014 this decade \u2014 that doesn't have any troops dying anywhere in the world.\"\n\nDetails: At least 16 U.S. service members have died while serving overseas during Mr. Biden's presidency. Thirteen U.S. service members died in an attack at the Kabul airport in Afghanistan in August 2021. Three soldiers were killed in an attack in Jordan in January of this year.\n\nBy Layla Ferris\n\nTrump claims he did not refer to U.S. soldiers who were killed as \"suckers and losers\": False\n\nTrump: \"First of all, that was a made-up quote. 'Suckers and losers,' they made it up.\"\n\nDetails: Current and former U.S. military service members have detailed to CBS News multiple instances when Trump made disparaging remarks about members of the U.S. military who were captured or killed, including referring to the American war dead at the Aisle-Marne American Cemetery in France in 2018 as \"losers\" and \"suckers.\"\n\nA senior Defense Department official and a former U.S. Marine Corps officer with direct knowledge of what was said detailed how Trump said he did not want to visit the cemetery because it was \"filled with losers.\" These accounts were backed independently by two other officials \u2014 a former senior U.S. Army officer and a separate, former senior U.S. Marine Corps officer.\n\nIn another conversation on the trip, Trump referred to the 1,800 Marines who died in the World War I battle of Belleau Wood as \"suckers\" for getting killed. The Atlantic was first to report Trump's comments in 2020. His former chief of staff John Kelly later confirmed to CNN the essence of what Trump had said.\n\nBy James LaPorta and Sierra Sanders\n\nBiden claims 40% fewer people are crossing border illegally, better than when Trump was in office: Partially true\n\nBiden: \"I've changed it in a way that now you're in a situation where there 40% fewer people coming across the border illegally; it's better than when he left office.\"\n\nDetails: Since Mr. Biden issued a proclamation banning most migrants from asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border in early June, illegal crossings there have dropped. In the past week, daily illegal border crossings have averaged roughly 2,000, according to internal Department of Homeland Security data obtained by CBS News. That's a 47% drop from the 3,800 daily average in May.\n\nDuring the height of a spike in migration faced by the Trump administration in 2019, Border Patrol recorded an average of 4,300 daily illegal crossings, government data show. But there were months during the Covid-19 pandemic when the Trump administration averaged fewer than 2,000 illegal border crossings.\n\nBy Camilo Montoya-Galvez\n\nTrump claims migrants coming to U.S. and \"killing our citizens at a level...we've never seen before\": Misleading\n\nTrump: \"People are coming in and killing our citizens at a level like we've never seen before.\"\n\nDetails: Some migrants who are believed to have entered the U.S. along the southern border in recent years have been charged with murder and other heinous crimes in different parts of the country. They include the suspect in the high-profile murder of Georgia nursing student Laken Riley.\n\nBut while the data on this question is not comprehensive, available studies have found that migrants living in the country illegally do not commit crimes at a higher rate than native-born Americans.\n\nGovernment statistics also show a very small fraction of migrants processed by Border Patrol have criminal records in the U.S. or other countries that share information with American officials.\n\nBy Camilo Montoya-Galvez\n\nOn COVID, Trump claims more people died under Biden administration than his: True, but needs context\n\nTrump: \"Remember, more people died under his administration \u2014 even though we had largely fixed it \u2014 more people died under his administration than our administration, and we were right in the middle of it, something which a lot of people don't like to talk about. But [Biden] had far more people dying in his administration.\"\n\nDetails: More than 460,000 people had died from COVID-19 by the end of the week that Biden was inaugurated in 2021, while more than 725,000 have died in the three years since then, according to data from the CDC. However, research has found that the counts of COVID-19 deaths, especially in the early days of the pandemic, were likely undercounted.\n\nBy Julia Ingram and Jui Sarwate\n\nIn discussing abortion, Trump claims former Virginia governor, a Democrat, supported killing babies: False\n\nTrump: \"If you look at the former governor of Virginia, he was willing to do this \u2014 he said 'we'll put the baby aside and we'll determine what we'll do with the baby'...meaning we'll kill the baby.\"\n\nDetails: In a 2019 radio interview then-governor of Virginia Ralph Northam, in discussing late-term abortions, addressed a hypothetical scenario in which a fetus was severely deformed or wasn't otherwise viable. He said, \"the infant would be delivered, the infant would be kept comfortable, the infant would be resuscitated if that's what the mother and the family desired.\"\n\nNortham did not say the fetus should be killed. Killing a newborn baby \u2014 or infanticide \u2014 is illegal in every state, and not a single state is trying to change that.\n\nBy Laura Doan and Daniel Klaidman\n\nTrump claims Biden \"went after\" his political opponent in New York \"hush money\" case to damage him: False\n\nTrump: \"[Biden] basically went after his political opponent (Trump) because he thought it was going to damage me, but when the public found out about these cases, 'cause they understand it better than he does, he has no idea what these cases are, but when they found out about these cases, you know what they did? My poll numbers went up, way up.\"\n\nDetails: There is no federal jurisdiction over a state case. The Manhattan district attorney's office is a separate entity from the U.S. Department of Justice. The department does not supervise the work of the Manhattan D.A.'s office, does not approve its charging decisions, and it does not try the D.A.'s cases.\n\nBy Pete Villasmil\n\nTrump claims he brought insulin prices down for seniors: Misleading\n\nTrump: \"I'm the one that got the insulin down for the seniors. I took care of the seniors.\"\n\nDetails: During Trump's time as president, Medicare created a voluntary program in 2020 between some plans and insulin manufacturers that agreed to cap out-of-pocket costs for insulin at $35 per month. Around half of Medicare Advantage or stand-alone prescription drug plans ended up participating by 2021.\n\nDavid Ricks, CEO of insulin drugmaker Eli Lilly, has taken credit for pioneering the idea with Trump administration officials at a congressional hearing and in an interview. In the same interview with STAT, Seema Verma, former Medicare agency chief in the Trump administration, gave Ricks the credit for the cap: \"He is an unsung hero. He was actually the mastermind of all of this.\"\n\nMedicare ended the policy in 2023, after Mr. Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act, which capped insulin costs for Medicare beneficiaries \u2014 not just for the portion of plans participating in the program. The law capped insulin costs at the same amount of $35 per month.\n\nBy Alexander Tin and Hunter Woodall\n\nTrump claims Biden wants open borders: False\n\nTrump: \"He wants open borders. He wants our country to either be destroyed or he wants to pick up those people as voters.\"\n\nDetails: When he took office, Mr. Biden reversed numerous Trump-era immigration policies, including a program that required migrants to await their asylum hearings in Mexico. U.S. Border Patrol has also reported record numbers of migrant apprehensions along the southern border during Mr. Biden's presidency. But Mr. Biden has never endorsed or implemented an \"open borders\" policy.\n\nIn fact, Mr. Biden has embraced some restrictive border policies that mirror rules enacted by his predecessor. In 2023, his administration published a regulation that disqualified migrants from asylum if they crossed into the country illegally after not seeking protection in a third country.\n\nEarlier this month, Mr. Biden enacted an even stricter policy: a proclamation that has partially shut down asylum processing along the border. His administration has also carried out over 4 million deportations, expulsions and returns of migrants since 2021, according to government data.\n\nOnly U.S. citizens can vote in federal elections. Most who cross into the U.S. illegally are not on a path to permanent legal status, let alone citizenship. Even those who apply and win asylum \u2014 a process that typically takes years to complete \u2014 have to wait five years as permanent U.S. residents before applying for American citizenship. There's no evidence to suggest that the Biden administration's border policy is based on a desire to convert migrants into voters.\n\nBy Camilo Montoya-Galvez\n\nBiden claims Trump wants to get rid of Social Security: False\n\nBiden \"[Trump] wants to get rid of Social Security. He thinks there's plenty to cut in social security. He's wanted to cut Social Security and Medicare, both times.\"\n\nDetails: Trump has repeatedly said he will try to protect Medicare and Social Security. Trump said in a March 21 Truth Social post that he would not \"under any circumstance\" allow Social Security to \"be even touched\" if he were president. Trump had said in a CNBC interview on March 11 that \"there is a lot you can do\" in terms of \"cutting\" spending under Social Security. Mr. Biden said the comments were proof Trump aimed to make cuts in the programs, but a Trump campaign spokesman said Trump was referring to \"cutting waste and fraud,\" not Social Security entitlements.\n\nBy Layla Ferris\n\nTrump claims Biden has the \"largest deficit\" in history of U.S.: False\n\nTrump: \"But he's (Biden) got the largest deficit in the history of our country.\"\n\nDetails: The national deficit was the largest it had been in over two decades under Trump's administration, not Mr. Biden's, according to data from the U.S. Treasury. The deficit peaked in fiscal year 2020 at $3.13 trillion, and declined to $1.7 trillion by the end of fiscal year 2023.\n\nBy Julia Ingram",

        "text": "Biden's debate disaster leaves democracy in peril\nPresident Joe Biden lost the debate last night, and he lost badly. He spoke the truth, but his voice was raspy. At times he was clear and focused as when he discussed complicated issues like immigration and Israel. But at 12 minutes into the debate, he lost his train of thought and couldn't finish his answer, switching from COVID-19 to Medicare without explanation. Throughout the 90-minute debate, he sometimes looked vacant. Very few of his answers were crisp and many sounded over-rehearsed. Former president Donald Trump repeatedly said things that were not true. He often deflected questions, including those pertaining to the assault on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. He kept returning to issues like the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan that matter to his base but not to undecided voters. None of that mattered. He was vigorous. He performed. He spoke without pausing; also, without a factual basis for his claims. But what mattered is that he projected energy and strength. A meme has emerged in this election: the \"double haters,\" people who hate both of their choices in the presidential contest. It is difficult for those of us on the left to see how anyone could fail to see that Trump is an unprecedented danger to democracy. Unfortunately, the discussion of threats to democracy did not begin until 39 minutes into the debate. He did not engage in a rant about election fraud until the last minutes of the debate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBiden's strengths \u2014 his decency, the sense that he truly cares about average people \u2014 these did not translate well on the debate stage. He had no stories that conveyed his natural empathy. His hurling insults at Trump had the effect of lowering him to Trump's level. In fact, Biden's attacks robbed him of his greatest strength vis-\u00e0-vis Trump: Trump constantly trashes the country, and he did so again last night, whereas Biden still believes in the American Dream. Biden rightly, and strongly, criticized Trump for trashing America, but it was too late. Besides, a minute later, they got into a debate about golf handicaps and Biden took the bait. Ugh. Trump's weaknesses \u2014 his narcissism, his dystopian vision, his contempt for the rule of law \u2014 none of these figured prominently in the debate, which is one reason the CNN hosts should be faulted. Trump parried the questions for which he had no answers. He benefitted from a format that involved no fact-checking. He did nothing to endear himself to undecided voters. If Biden had not bombed, Trump's performance would have been viewed negatively. But Biden did bomb. Debates are rarely decisive; they tend to clarify perceptions that are already prevalent. And the perceptions that matter have next to nothing to do with issues or policy. People do not vote for a slate of policies. Party platforms were once meaningful documents, but that has not been the case for decades. Instead, debates clarify perceptions of the person.\n\nDebates are rarely decisive; they tend to clarify perceptions that are already prevalent. Tweet this",

It underpinned federal protections for the rights to abortions, and has been a fixture of Mr Biden's re-election campaign.\n\nWhen asked about a recent Supreme Court ruling decision to approve abortion medication despite state bans, Mr Trump supported it and insisted returning power on abortion to state governments was what \"everyone wanted\".\n\nAfter discussing how \"the states are working it out\", Mr Trump added: \"I believe in the exceptions. I am a person that believes, and frankly, I think it's important to believe in the exceptions.\"\n\nMr Biden then told Mr Trump \"it's been a terrible thing what you've done\" in overturning Roe v Wade, and said he was making it harder for women in large swathes of the country to get access to basic health care.\n\nThe president also said he supported abortions in the third trimester of pregnancy and that \"no politician should be making that decision\" on when one should take place.\n\n\"A doctor should be making those decisions,\" he added. \"That's how it should be run. That's what you're going to do. And if I'm elected, I'm going to restore Roe v Wade.\"\n\nWatch a special programme with reaction to the US presidential debate on The World with Yalda Hakim on Sky News from 6pm\n\nImage: Trump claimed that removing Roe v Wade and leaving abortion rights to states was what 'everyone wanted' Pic: REUTERS/Brian Snyder\n\nImmigration\n\nWhile time was allotted for immigration as a topic on its own, Mr Trump hammered Mr Biden on the issue throughout the debate, including after the Democrat's first answer on abortion.\n\nRead more: Trump and Biden vow tough action in rival Texas visits\n\n\"There have been many young women murdered by the same people,\" the former president said. \"He allows to come across our border.\"\n\nLater on, Mr Biden was asked why he should be trusted on immigration after a record number of illegal migrants have crossed the border from Mexico under his current administration.\n\nHe pointed to how he brought in \"significant increased number of asylum officers\", and attacked Mr Trump's record in office\n\nAfter another rambling answer, Mr Trump said: \"I really don't know what he said at the end of that sentence. I don't think he knows what he said either.\"\n\nHe then claimed that under his administration, the US \"had the safest border in the history of our country.\" In a terse moment, Mr Biden spoke about Mr Trump's previous comments on veterans, where he was alleged to have called those who died in war \"suckers and losers\".\n\nThe president got personal in evoking his son, Beau Biden, who served in Iraq before dying of brain cancer, and told Mr Trump: \"My son was not a loser, was not a sucker. You're the sucker. You're the loser.\"\n\nImage: 'My son was not a loser... You're the sucker.

Just like Israel would have never been invaded in a million years by Hamas.\"\n\nMr Biden said, \"I never heard so much malarkey in my whole life\" before defending his record on foreign policy, pointing to how \"we got over 100,000 Americans and others out\" of Afghanistan and to Mr Trump's comments on NATO.\n\nOn Israel, both candidates vowed support. Mr Biden touted his May ceasefire offer, while Mr Trump said of the president: \"He's become like a Palestinian, but they don't like him because he's a very bad Palestinian.\"\n\nRead more on Sky News:\n\nUvalde shooting police chief charged\n\n'100ft deep' sinkhole in middle of football pitch\n\nHuge streamer admits to 'inappropriate' messages\n\nImage: People attend a debate watch party at Union Pub on Capitol Hill in Washington Pic: REUTERS/Nathan Howard\n\nDemocracy and January 6\n\nWhen asked about what he would say to voters who were concerned about a possible second term for Mr Trump after the January 6th riots, the former president again touted his economic and immigration records.\n\nWhen asked the question again by the moderators, Mr Trump then made false claims about former House speaker Nancy Pelosi and about an offer of sending the National Guard.\n\nMr Biden said Mr Trump \"didn't do a damn thing\" to stop his supporters marching on Capitol Hill while the 2020 election results were being certified, saying the rioters \"should be in jail... and he wants to let them all out\".\n\nHe then called Mr Trump a \"convicted felon\" over being found guilty on 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels.\n\nFollow Sky News on WhatsApp Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky News Tap here\n\nMr Biden added: \"Think of all the civil penalties you have.

        "text": "(News) Trump v Biden: How Will the 2024 US Presidential Election Outcome Shape US-Vietnam Relations?\nWith both Donald Trump and sitting president Joe Biden having served in the White House, we have unique insight into how a second presidential term for either candidate could shape the future of US-Vietnam relations.\n\nThe 2024 US presidential election is poised to exert a critical influence not only on domestic policies but also on America\u2019s international relationships, particularly with strategic partners like Vietnam. As the largest export market for Vietnam and a crucial ally in the Indo-Pacific region, the United States holds a pivotal role in shaping bilateral trade, investment, and cooperation agendas.\n\nThe election outcome will profoundly impact these dynamics, determining future policies on tariffs, trade agreements, and broader economic initiatives between the two nations. Stakeholders and businesses on both sides are closely watching how candidates\u2019 foreign policy platforms will shape the future of US-Vietnam relations and their implications for global economic landscapes.\n\nWith both candidates having previously served a term in office, we have unique insight into how a second term for either candidate could shape the course of future US-Vietnam relations. We look at how US-Vietnam relations developed under the respective Trump and Biden administrations and discuss how the different outcomes of the 2024 US presidential election could shape future trade, investment, diplomacy, and defense cooperation.\n\nTrade and investment relations: Trump and Biden report card\n\nTrade relations under Trump\n\nDuring his term in office, Trump reversed much of the progress on US-Vietnam trade relations made by his predecessor.\n\nOne such move was his decision in 2017 to pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement negotiations, a key policy position of the previous Obama administration. The TPP, which consisted of 12 Pacific countries, including the US and Vietnam, would have helped to expand bilateral trade significantly by removing technical barriers to trade and reducing tariffs.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to pull out of the TPP had ramifications that last until today. The TPP eventually evolved into the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) without the US\u2019s involvement, in the process decreasing the total GDP of members to US$10.1 trillion (without the US) from a potential US$28.7 trillion (with the US).\n\nMoreover, by withdrawing from the negotiations (as well as other actions against free trade), Trump cemented an anti-globalist and anti-free trade sentiment within the US Congress, which has made it difficult for subsequent administrations to consider joining. Despite widespread support for the US\u2019s accession by current members, the Biden administration has refrained from reentering negotiations, instead pursuing its own Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF).\n\nSection 301 investigations\n\nDuring Trump\u2019s term, his trade policy was heavily focused on scrutinizing the US foreign trade deficit. While his primary target was China, he also took aim at Vietnam, with which the US had a trade deficit of over US$38 billion in 2017. This deficit expanded to almost US$70 billion by the end of his term, and to US$104 billion in 2023.\n\nIn October 2020, the US Trade Representative (USTR) launched two Section 301 investigations into Vietnam, one into whether Vietnam was undervaluing its currency and one related to Vietnam\u2019s import and use of timber. Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 is the legislation under which the USTR can investigate alleged trade violations of foreign governments, and the section under which it imposed tariffs on over US$500 billion worth of Chinese goods in 2018 and 2019.\n\nIn a report released on January 15, 2021, the USTR concluded that Vietnam was undervaluing its currency to achieve an economic advantage and that these actions contributed to a trade imbalance with the US and other countries. As a result, the US listed Vietnam as a currency manipulator.\n\nWhile the report found that Vietnam\u2019s behavior was \u201cactionable\u201d under Section 301, the USTR also said in a statement on January 19, Trump\u2019s last day in office, that it would not take any actions in relation to the findings.\n\nTrade relations under Biden\n\nThe Biden administration has taken a considerably different approach to trade with Vietnam during his term, taking steps to expand trade and investment ties between the two countries. Total trade between Vietnam and the US has steadily grown during Biden\u2019s term in office, increasing from around US$113 billion in 2021 to US$124.3 billion in 2023.\n\nDuring Biden\u2019s first year in office, the USTR quickly resolved the disputes raised in the Section 301 investigations. In April 2021, it said there was \u201cinsufficient evidence\u201d to classify Vietnam as a currency manipulator. In July 2021, it announced that no action would be taken against Vietnam, as a \u201csatisfactory\u201d agreement had been reached between the US Treasury Department and the State Bank of Vietnam. However, it also stated that it would continue to monitor Vietnam\u2019s implementation of its commitments going forward.\n\nFurther, in October 2021, the USTR stated that it had reached an agreement with Vietnam to address concerns over the export of timber to the US that had been harvested illegally to the detriment of the environment. As a result of this agreement, the USTR determined that no trade action against Vietnam was warranted.\n\nBiden has not launched any further investigations or sought any trade disputes with Vietnam during his term. The USTR also continues to leave Vietnam off the list of currency manipulators.\n\nNonetheless, due in part to the unpopularity of the agreement within the US Congress, Biden has not pursued accession to the CPTPP. This would be one of the most significant ways in which the US could expand trade with Vietnam.\n\nNotwithstanding, Biden has pursued his own trade deal with Asia Pacific nations, the IPEF. Launched in May 2022, the IPEF includes 14 founding members in the Indo-Pacific region, including Vietnam, which together cover 40 percent of the world\u2019s GDP. The IPEF seeks to develop trade between the member nations through measures such as facilitating the provision of trade licenses, reducing customs red tape, and improving regulatory transparency in the region. In particular, the IPEF seeks to expand trade in agricultural products, of which the US is a major exporter.\n\nHowever, unlike the CPTPP, the IPEF currently does not propose reducing or eliminating tariffs.\n\nIn September 2023, following a state visit by Biden to Hanoi, the US and Vietnam officially elevated bilateral relations to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP), pledging among other things to further open up each other\u2019s markets to trade and investment.\n\nIn October 2023, the US Department of Commerce (DOC) initiated a review of Vietnam\u2019s economic status as a non-market economy (NME), in response to a request from the Vietnamese government to upgrade it to a \u201cmarket-based economy\u201d. Per US law, an NME is defined as any foreign country that the DOC determines does not adhere to market principles regarding cost or prices, leading to the sale of goods within that country failing to reflect their fair value. NMEs are subject to certain antidumping and countervailing duties.\n\nIf the review, which will conclude in July 2024, finds that Vietnam can now be considered a market-based economy, it would significantly ease exports from Vietnam to the US. However, it is still unclear what the conclusion will be, given the varying interests between different stakeholders on the matter.\n\nInvestment and business cooperation under Trump\n\nDuring Trump\u2019s tenure, US investment in Vietnam grew steadily. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), the US direct investment position in Vietnam grew from US$2.46 billion in 2017 to US$2.53 billion in 2020. The highest level it reached during Trump\u2019s term was US$2.9 billion in 2018.\n\nMeanwhile, the total assets of majority-owned foreign affiliates of US multinational enterprises (MNEs) in Vietnam grew from US$13 billion in 2017 to US$18.9 billion in 2021 (although it fell to just US$12.8 billion in 2020 due to the impact of the pandemic). The number of employees of US MNE affiliates in Vietnam also grew from 54,700 in 2017 to 75,700 in 2021.\n\nThe Trump administration placed a strong emphasis on energy cooperation. In 2019, the US and Vietnam signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), establishing a comprehensive energy cooperation partnership to facilitate cooperation on energy markets. Trump also heavily pushed for Vietnam to increase imports of American liquified natural gas (LNG) as a means of balancing the trade deficit and encouraged US energy companies to expand in the Vietnamese market. Vietnam\u2019s fast-growing economy is still heavily reliant on LNG and other fossil fuels, despite efforts to green its economy.\n\nFollowing the signing of the MoU, Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc agreed to assign US utility company AES Corporation to be the major investor in the US$5 billion Son My II Gas Power Plant in the southeastern province of Binh Thuan under a build-operate-transfer (BOT) contract. The plant will reportedly be required to import nearly US$2 billion worth of LNG from the US each year.\n\nOther US energy companies such as ExxonMobil have also explored opportunities in Vietnam\u2019s energy sector, including investing in LNG-to-power projects.\n\nInvestment and business cooperation under Biden\n\nUS investment in Vietnam has increased further in the years since Biden took office, with the US\u2019s total direct investment position in the country reaching US$3.5 billion in 2022.\n\nBiden has actively sought to promote business cooperation and investment with Vietnam and the wider Pacific region during his term, in areas such as clean energy, high-end technology (in particular semiconductors), and digital industries.\n\nOne of the pillars of the IPEF is the Fair Economy Agreement, which aims to create a more \u201ctransparent and predictable\u201d trade and investment environment by preventing and combatting financial crime, improving tax administration and transparency, and increasing cooperation and information sharing on these issues.\n\nMeanwhile, the US-Vietnam CSP aims to foster robust investment and business collaboration between the two nations, with a particular emphasis on advancing science, technology, innovation, and digital infrastructure. A cornerstone of this partnership is the development of Vietnam\u2019s semiconductor industry, recognized for its potential to enhance global supply chains.\n\nThe Biden administration\u2019s commitment to supporting Vietnam in this endeavor includes substantial initiatives funded through the International Technology Security and Innovation Fund (ITSI Fund), part of the CHIPS Act. Some of these funds, amounting to US$500 million over five years, will aid in fortifying Vietnam\u2019s semiconductor ecosystem, regulatory framework, and workforce development. It has also set aside an initial seed funding of US$2 million to establish teaching labs and training courses focused on semiconductor assembly, testing, and packaging (ATP) in Vietnam, crucial for skill development in this sector.\n\nFurthermore, the CSP envisions comprehensive cooperation in promoting secure and reliable digital infrastructure across Vietnam, which is poised to catalyze opportunities for digital capability enhancement and foster growth in the country\u2019s digital economy. Per the CSP White House fact sheet, initiatives include exploring the establishment of an Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) training lab and ensuring the adoption of emerging technologies. These efforts underscore a shared commitment to advancing innovation and entrepreneurship, paving the way for sustained collaboration between US and Vietnamese industries in critical and emerging technologies.\n\n2. US-Vietnam trade relations under a future Trump and Biden presidency\n\nUnder a second Trump term\n\nA second Trump term could have significant implications for US-Vietnam trade relations. Given his anti-globalist stance and ongoing criticism of trade deficits, the prospects for a new Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Vietnam appear slim. Trump\u2019s consistent emphasis on reducing trade deficits suggests his administration could reopen Section 301 investigations into Vietnamese goods or trade practices. Given that the trade deficit with Vietnam has continued to grow since his previous term in office, the Trump administration might perceive renewed investigations as a necessary measure to address this issue.\n\nFurthermore, Trump has proposed a universal baseline tariff of 10 percent on most imported foreign goods as part of his 2024 campaign. This policy aims to protect American industries and address unfair trading practices, including currency manipulation. While this tariff would not specifically target Vietnam, Vietnamese exporters are particularly vulnerable to the potential impact of such a policy, as the US is Vietnam\u2019s largest export market and a major exporter of the types of goods that are likely to be targeted for additional tariffs. With Vietnam previously labeled a currency manipulator by the first Trump administration, it is likely to be a prime candidate for additional tariffs under a counter-currency manipulation mechanism proposed as part of his trade policy if he wins a second term.\n\nA potential consequence of an increasingly protectionist US under Trump could be that Vietnam seeks to further strengthen its trade relations with China. This shift could involve deeper economic cooperation and increased trade volumes to compensate for potential losses in the US market. However, Vietnam would need to navigate its complex geopolitical relationship with China, balancing economic benefits with national security concerns.\n\nUnder a second Biden term\n\nA second Biden term is likely to see continued efforts to improve bilateral trade relations between the US and Vietnam, a crucial part of Biden\u2019s commitment to fostering stronger economic ties with the wider Indo-Pacific region. This is evident from the Biden administration\u2019s continued commitment to advancing the IPEF, as well as continued collaboration with the Vietnamese government to enhance trade relations. Under a second term, this partnership could include further efforts to streamline trade processes, improve supply chain connectivity, and enhance regulatory frameworks to facilitate smoother trade flows.\n\nHowever, Biden\u2019s reluctance to consider CPTPP membership or a bilateral FTA with Vietnam suggests that progress could be limited. Such steps would lead to significant tariff reductions, but their absence suggests that the Biden administration is focusing on other avenues to strengthen trade without fully committing to these broader or bilateral trade deals.\n\nMoreover, there are underlying uncertainties primarily linked to the complex dynamics of US-China trade relations. Evidence suggests that some Chinese exporters are circumventing US tariffs by routing goods through Vietnam. World Bank data and economic analysts have noted a correlation between increased Vietnamese imports from China and subsequent exports from Vietnam to the US. This trend could pose a challenge for Vietnam if the Biden administration intensifies efforts to prevent such tariff circumvention. Given that Biden has expanded tariffs on Chinese goods during his term, a second term could see an escalation of US-China trade tensions, potentially leading to more stringent measures to address these circumvention practices.\n\nIf the US imposes stricter controls on imports from third countries suspected of acting as conduits for Chinese goods, Vietnam\u2019s exports could be caught in the crosshairs. This would not only impact Vietnam\u2019s export economy but also strain the US-Vietnam trade relationship.\n\n3. Diplomacy and defense relations: Trump and Biden report card\n\nDiplomacy and defense under Trump\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s critical stance on global trade and his isolationist attitude, he and his administration continued to regard Vietnam as an important partner to the US in the Pacific region.\n\nHis term saw several high-profile diplomatic engagements between US and Vietnamese officials, with Trump himself visiting Vietnam in November 2017, after attending the APEC Summit Week. The US Secretary of Defense under Trump, James Mattis, made two visits to Hanoi in 2018, to further develop bilateral military ties. On his first visit, Mattis called the US and Vietnam \u201clike-minded partners\u201d, stating that they \u201cshare values based on mutual respect and common interests, including freedom of navigation, respect for international law, and recognition of national sovereignty.\u201d\n\nUS-Vietnam defense relations in recent decades have been shaped in large part by the legacy of the Vietnamese War, in particular war remediation. The Trump administration oversaw the continuation of these efforts. In early 2018, USAID signed agreements with Vietnam\u2019s Ministry of National Defense for a five-year US$183 million dioxin (a component of Agent Orange) cleanup project at the Bien Hoa Airbase near Ho Chih Minh City.\n\nThe other core aspect of the US and Vietnam\u2019s defense collaboration is the joint perceived threat of China. China and Vietnam share overlapping territorial claims in the South China Sea, which has led to a decades-long dispute involving intermittent military posturing and disruption of each other\u2019s operations in the region.\n\nVietnam\u2019s dispute with China dovetails with the US\u2019s broader security concerns and desire to contain Chinese influence in the Indo-Pacific region. This shared strategic interest has led to increased defense ties, with Vietnam seeking to modernize its military capabilities. The US has become a key partner in this effort, providing Vietnam with defense equipment and training, which is seen as a counterbalance to China\u2019s growing influence.\n\nTrump built upon the progress made by predecessors to increase US influence in the Indo-Pacific. At the end of 2017, his administration launched the \u201cFree and Open Indo-Pacific\u201d initiative, adopting various concepts from Obama\u2019s \u201cRebalance to Asia and the Pacific\u201d strategy. The initiative formed part of Trump\u2019s National Security Strategy (NSS), which classified Vietnam as a \u201cgrowing security and economic partner\u201d.\n\nThe US made several arms transfers to Vietnam during Trump\u2019s term in office. According to the US Department of Defense (DOD), between 2016 and 2021, the US authorized the permanent export of US$29.8 million in defense articles to Vietnam. In 2018, the US provided US$81.5 million in foreign military financing to \u201csupport the Indo-Pacific Strategy\u201d.\n\nDiplomacy and defense under Biden\n\nUS-Vietnam defense relations continued to see healthy development after Biden took office in late January 2021, aided by his more globalist worldview and softer stance on Vietnam trade. US military support to Vietnam enjoyed continuity, with the country receiving a total of US$104 billion in State Department-funded security assistance under the Foreign Military Financing program between 2017 and 2023.\n\nIn September 2023, the Biden administration was in talks to conclude an arms deal with Vietnam, reportedly one of the largest in history between ex-Cold War adversaries. While the deal has not yet come to fruition, it suggests that the Biden administration is keen to advance military cooperation with Vietnam\n\nThe US-Vietnam CSP signed in September 2023 also included commitments to advance cooperation on security and defense, including further cooperation in defense trade. The US also stated that it is \u201ccommitted to continuing to assist Vietnam to develop its self-reliant defense capabilities\u201d, signaling continued military support.\n\nIt is important to note that despite shared goals in the South China Sea, Vietnam maintains a policy of strategic non-alignment. While it has engaged in defense cooperation, it has not formed formal military alliances, reflecting its complex relationship with China, which includes deep economic ties and a shared border.\n\nFurther, Vietnam has also increasingly relied on arms purchases from Russia, angering the US. Vietnam has historically relied on Russia for arms supplies but has sought to reduce this reliance in recent years. However, Vietnam has continued to purchase arms from Russia, due to their lower cost than US arms and the fact that US supplies may not be compatible with its existing Russian systems.\n\nThis reliance on Russian arms may put Vietnam at risk of violating US sanctions. Under the Countering America\u2019s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), which was enacted in 2017, countries that engage in significant transactions with Russia\u2019s defense or intelligence sectors could face US sanctions. This has placed Vietnam in a challenging position, as it seeks to modernize its military while balancing its defense relationships with both the US and Russia. The continuation of arms purchases from Russia by Vietnam could potentially lead to sanctions or other punitive measures from the US, complicating the bilateral defense and business relations between the two countries.\n\nDuring a recent visit by Russian President Vladimir Putin to Vietnam, a series of agreements were signed, including those aimed at bolstering cooperation in various sectors, though none explicitly mentioned defense. Nevertheless, the visit garnered a strong reaction from the US with a spokesperson from the Embassy in Hanoi telling media that \u201cNo country should give Putin a platform to promote his war of aggression and otherwise allow him to normalize his atrocities\u201d.\n\nHowever, while visiting Vietnam a few days after Putin\u2019s trip, US Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and Pacific Affairs Daniel Kritenbrink stated that trust between the US and Vietnam was at an \u201call-time high\u201d and that the US respected Vietnam\u2019s independence in its decisions over its security strategy.\n\n4. The future of US-Vietnam diplomacy and defense relations\n\nUnder a second Trump term\n\nIf Donald Trump were to serve a second term, US-Vietnam defense relations could take a distinct path shaped by his \u201cAmerica First\u201d stance and critical view of US involvement in international conflicts. Despite recognizing Vietnam as a crucial partner in the Indo-Pacific during his first term, Trump\u2019s overall isolationist attitude might undermine efforts to deepen collaboration. His administration\u2019s focus on bilateral deals over multilateral alliances could lead to more transactional and less comprehensive engagement with Vietnam.\n\nHowever, Trump\u2019s softer approach towards Russia, exemplified by his appeasement and even occasional praise of Putin, suggests that Vietnam might not face US sanctions under the CAATSA for purchasing Russian weapons. This could provide Vietnam with more flexibility in its defense procurement, avoiding the complexities and potential fallout of violating US sanctions.\n\nDespite these challenges, Trump would likely continue to support Vietnam in defense matters, given the shared strategic interest in countering China\u2019s influence in the South China Sea. His administration might continue to provide military equipment and training, viewing Vietnam as a key partner in maintaining regional stability. However, Trump\u2019s unpredictable foreign policy and possible withdrawal from broader strategic commitments could weaken the US\u2019s image in the Indo-Pacific, potentially eroding the trust and cooperation that had been building between the US and Vietnam.\n\nUnder a second Biden term\n\nA second term for Biden would likely see a continuation and deepening of US-Vietnam defense relations, underpinned by his administration\u2019s strong foreign policy stance in the Indo-Pacific and commitment to supporting Vietnam\u2019s defense capabilities. Biden\u2019s globalist outlook and emphasis on multilateralism could foster a more stable and predictable partnership with Vietnam. The potential for a significant arms deal, as hinted in ongoing talks, reflects Biden\u2019s intent to advance military cooperation with Vietnam.\n\nHowever, Biden\u2019s firm stance against Russia, driven by the conflict in Ukraine, might lead to stricter enforcement of CAATSA sanctions. Should Biden enforce these sanctions, it could strain US-Vietnam ties, complicating the delicate balance Vietnam maintains in its defense relationships with both the US and Russia. Biden\u2019s administration would need to navigate this carefully, potentially offering more robust and compatible defense alternatives to Russian equipment to mitigate the impact on Vietnam\u2019s military modernization efforts.\n\nDespite these potential hurdles, Biden\u2019s strong support for Vietnam\u2019s self-reliant defense capabilities and strategic importance in the Indo-Pacific would likely ensure continued robust defense collaboration.\n\n5. Preparing for either outcome: Considerations for businesses\n\nBusinesses preparing for potential second terms under either Trump or Biden need to consider several key factors that could impact US-Vietnam trade and investment relations.\n\nUnder a hypothetical second Trump term, businesses should brace for the introduction of new tariffs, including the possibility of a 10 percent universal tariff. This policy could significantly escalate trade tensions and increase costs for businesses reliant on imported goods from Vietnam, impacting their competitiveness and profitability.\n\nTrump\u2019s anti-globalist stance and skepticism toward multilateral trade agreements suggest a less favorable environment for comprehensive trade deals like the TPP or bilateral FTAs. This makes the reduction of tariffs and barriers unlikely, limiting opportunities for businesses seeking expanded market access.\n\nMoreover, under Trump, there is a potential for renewed Section 301 investigations targeting Vietnam\u2019s trade practices, similar to those initiated during his first term. This could lead to increased regulatory scrutiny and potential tariffs on Vietnamese goods, further complicating business operations and supply chains.\n\nIn contrast, a second Biden term would likely maintain a more globalist stance, focusing on enhancing US-Vietnam trade relations through initiatives like the IPEF. Biden\u2019s approach also emphasizes collaboration on emerging technologies, digital industries, and clean energy. This presents opportunities for businesses involved in these sectors to benefit from increased investment and cooperation initiatives supported by the US government. The emphasis on green energy and technology under Biden could open new avenues for partnerships and growth in these high-demand sectors.\n\nHowever, businesses must also navigate potential geopolitical tensions, particularly in the South China Sea. Biden\u2019s more interventionist stance toward China and the Indo-Pacific could lead to heightened tensions and potentially impact supply chains and businesses operating in the region. Increased military activity and geopolitical uncertainty may disrupt supply chains and market stability, requiring businesses to adopt flexible strategies to mitigate risks.\n\nSource: Vietnam Briefing",

Trump claimed he could \u201csettle\u201d the war in Ukraine by January 2025 without making it clear how, and accused Biden of escalating the conflict, as Biden warned against Trump\u2019s bashing of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Trump asserted his goals to draw down military engagement abroad; Biden played up the importance of global alliances, but in doing so, erroneously claimed his presidency was the only one this decade without any troop deaths overseas. Trump described immigration as uncontrolled and made repeated sweeping claims about migrants\u2019 role in committing crime, while Biden defended steps taken both at the southern U.S. border and in the U.S. asylum system. Meanwhile, Trump said his proposed new tariffs would not increase prices for consumers, which economists dispute.\n\nThe event was the earliest presidential debate in U.S. history, pitting against each other the two oldest main party candidates ever to compete for the presidency. Trump also reiterated false claims of fraud in the 2020 presidential election and suggested he was not responsible for the January 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. He did not unequivocally commit to accepting this year\u2019s election result, saying he would accept the outcome if it was \u201cfair\u201d and \u201clegal.\u201d The debate was closely watched by U.S. allies for signals of potential political changes. (CNN, Foreign Policy, AP, NYT, Reuters)\n\nANALYSIS \"Trump and Biden are further apart on their approach to Washington's international relations than most presidential candidates in recent history have been, with Biden seeking to restore America's global standing and relationship with traditional allies while Trump espouses a far more isolationist doctrine,\" Foreign Policy's Rishi Iyengar and Christina Lu write. \"The spectacle was alarming at a time when the next U.S. president's foreign policy choices matter more than ever. With two wars raging in Ukraine and Gaza, a rivalry with China that risks Europe's economic autonomy and is dividing the world, and a climate crisis that demands US leadership, the stakes are especially high,\" Chatham House's Leslie Vinjamuri writes.\n\nThis CFR election tracker compares the two presidential candidates on major foreign policy issues.\n\nMore on: Daily News Brief\n\nThis issue of Foreign Affairs explores the future of global policy at stake in November\u2019s election.\n\nDaily News Brief A summary of global news developments with CFR analysis delivered to your inbox each morning.

        "text": "'Very bad Palestinian': Trump slams Biden's Israel performance at presidential debate\nPresident Biden and former President Donald Trump were put in the hot seat regarding Middle East policy in Thursday night's first presidential debate of the 2024 campaign when asked respectively about leverage over Hamas and Israel to end the war and support for a Palestinian state.\n\nBiden outlined the three phases of his ceasefire proposal and said Hamas is the only one who wants the war to continue and is standing in the way of the deal.\n\n\"We're still pushing hard for them to accept,\" Biden said.\n\nHe added that Hamas has been greatly weakened and should be eliminated.\n\nIsrael remained a crucial topic for Republican and Democratic candidates alike\n\nWhile not naming Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Biden acknowledged Netanyahu's claims that he's denied Israel weapons. People watch the first Presidential debate between US President Joe Biden and Republican candidate, former President Donald Trump, from a tavern in San Diego, California, US, June 27, 2024. (credit: REUTERS)\n\n\"The only thing I've denied Israel was 2,000-pound bombs; they don't work very well in populated areas,\" he said. \"We are providing Israel with all the weapons they need and when they need them.\"\n\nBiden added that \"he's the guy that organized the world against Iran\" when they had a full-blown ballistic missile attack on Israel.\n\nBiden touted that not one Israeli was accidentally killed.\n\n\"We saved Israel. We are the biggest producer of support for Israel out of anyone in the world,\" Biden said.\n\nTrump said \"he'd have to see\" when asked if he'd support a Palestinian state. Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter Subscribe Now\n\nReferencing Biden's claim that Hamas is the only one who wants war, Trump said Israel wants war.\n\n\"And he should let them go and let them finish the job,\" Trump said of Biden. \"He doesn't want to do it. He's become like a Palestinian, but they don't like him because he's a very bad Palestinian. He's a weak one.\"\n\nDuring the debate, Trump claimed that Hamas would never have invaded Israel if he were president.\n\nRegarding the Israel-Hamas war, Biden stated, \"We are the biggest supporter of Israel in the world,\" adding, \"Hamas cannot be allowed to continue.\"\n\nThere were no questions about humanitarian aid to Gaza or specific day-after plans.\n\nThere were also no questions on Lebanon or rising antisemitism in the US and around the world.\n\nThe two men also traded barbs on abortion, immigration, the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, their handling of the economy, and even their golf games as they each sought to shake up what opinion polls show has been a virtually tied race for months.\n\nBackground behind the highly anticipated debate\n\nBiden and Trump have made little effort to disguise their mutual dislike. During their first debate in 2020, Trump aggressively talked over Biden in a performance that turned off many voters.\n\nBoth men entered the debate in Atlanta with political vulnerabilities that presented a mix of risk and opportunity.\n\nThe clash also arrived at a moment of profound polarization and deep-seated anxiety among voters about the state of American politics. Two-thirds of voters said in a May Reuters/Ipsos poll that they were concerned violence could follow the election, nearly four years after a mob of Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol.\n\nTrump, 78, took the stage as a felon who still faces a trio of criminal cases, including charges related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nBiden, 81, was under intense pressure to avoid verbal stumbles and deliver a forceful debate performance after months of Republican assertions his faculties have dulled with age.\n\nAhead of the debate, each campaign was set to launch a new ad campaign attacking its rival.\n\nThe Biden campaign said it would launch a new ad blitz in the Atlanta area focused on what a second Trump presidency could look like, including threats to reproductive freedom, a ban on abortion, cuts to Social Security, and undermining democracy.\n\nCNN attempted to avoid cross-talk by muting the candidates' microphones when it was not their turn to speak. The debate also took place without an audience, and neither candidate was allowed to bring prepared notes or props, though they were allowed to have a pen and paper.\n\nBiden advisers say he emphasized Trump's role in threatening abortion access, portray him as a danger to democratic norms, and remind voters of Trump's often chaotic 2017-2021 term in office.\n\nTrump focused on Biden's stewardship of the southern US border in the face of record numbers of migrants crossing illegally as well as the economy, particularly inflation, while also questioning his world leadership at a time of war in Gaza and Ukraine, Trump advisers said.\n\nThe second and final debate in this year's campaign is scheduled for September.",

Why would you want to \u2014 did they want to replace Trump? Look at all the things \u2014 he\u2019s a convicted felon,\u201d she said.\n\nBrazil added that \u201cthe Democrats need to get together and stick with what they got and try to improve them with what they have instead of trying to replace it. You don\u2019t replace nothing like that.\u201d\n\nBrazil described the debate as \u201chorrible\u201d because \u201cTrump lied when he first opened up his mouth.\u201d\n\n\u201cBiden was trying to tell the truth, but by him being a stutterer and having problem speaking properly, and having a cold, he had a problem delivering his points because he was trying to fact-check Trump on everything,\u201d she added.",

        "text": "Biden's debate disaster: U.S. president freezes up against Trump\nIt was agony in Atlanta \u2014 for Joe Biden, for Democrats and for anyone around the world dreading another Donald Trump presidency.\n\nBecause the chances of that happening just grew.\n\nBiden appeared confused for an agonizing 14 seconds early on in a catastrophic moment that will enter the cringe-inducing annals in the history of presidential debates.\n\nHis voice raspy, his gaze distant, Biden's early slip-ups immediately prompted chatter about whether the sitting president should withdraw from the race. It had Democrats eyeing the calendar and wondering whether Biden might step aside before their convention in two months, so delegates could pick a different nominee.\n\nAfter the debate ended, there was hardly any need for a Republican on the post-event panels; the despondent Democrats were brutal enough, speculating about Biden dropping out.\n\n\"It's not just panic; it's pain,\" Democratic analyst Van Jones said in a cri de coeur on CNN, right after Thursday's debate ended.\n\n\"I love Joe Biden. I worked for Joe Biden \u2026 I love that guy. That's a good man,\" Jones said.\n\n\"[But] I think there's a lot of people who are going to want to see him consider taking a different course now. We're still far from our convention. And there is time for this party to figure out a different way forward, if he will allow us to do that.\"\n\nIn the generally friendly New York Times opinion section, columns carried headlines like, \"President Biden, it's time to drop out\" and \"Biden can not go on like this\" and \"President Biden is my friend. He must bow out of the race.\"\n\nWATCH | Analyzing the U.S. presidential debate: Trump attacks, Biden verbally stumbles at 1st presidential debate Duration 7:56 CBC's Adrienne Arsenault, Katie Simpson and Paul Hunter break down the U.S. presidential debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Each candidate took aim at the other\u2019s character and competence, but while Trump seemed confident and focused, Biden seemed to ramble and lose his train of thought in a shaky performance that has reinforced concerns about his age.\n\nBiden's performance distracted from Trump's deficiencies\n\nFormer Democratic senator Claire McCaskill, over on MSNBC, also described herself as heartbroken. She couldn't say whether Biden would remain the candidate and said she was being deluged with texts from terrified party donors and members of Congress.\n\nBiden's cognitive clunkers distracted from what ordinarily would have been the main post-debate story in any normal political era: Trump's own deficiencies.\n\nThe former president made wild claims; he showed no contrition for his role in one of the darkest moments in American history \u2014 the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021; and he wouldn't say unequivocally whether he will accept the results of this election.\n\nBut a well-respected, non-partisan U.S. elections analyst argued that the damage here was unquestionable: Biden lost ground, Amy Walter said.\n\nIt was Biden who asked for this debate , months earlier than usual, because he was keen to reset the race, where he's behind in most polls.\n\n\"Instead, only thing we're talking about is Biden's poor performance,\" tweeted Walter, the editor-in-chief of the Cook Political Report.\n\n\"[The] biggest problem for Biden now is that his base/donors are going to be super depressed and worried.\"\n\nIn other words, it's time to panic now. Unless you're rooting for Trump.\n\nThe opening moments of the debate, which tend to be the most watched, could easily have been a snapshot of the Biden presidency.\n\nHe's racked up some historic wins, with one of the most successful legislative records in the modern era, with bills on infrastructure, green energy, reshoring high-tech manufacturing, lowering drug prices, gun control, expanding NATO and stimulating new jobs, which roared back after the pandemic.\n\nBut he couldn't explain one such win.\n\nWATCH | Biden stumbles and Trump pounces: Biden stumbles on health-care answer as Trump pounces Duration 0:39 U.S. President Joe Biden appeared to lose his train of thought during a debate in Atlanta that aired on CNN with former president Donald Trump, saying, \u2018Look, we finally beat Medicare.\u2019 Trump responded by saying, \u2018He beat it to death.\u2019\n\n14 cringe-inducing seconds\n\nIn a lapse unimaginable for most occupants of his office, Biden veered off course into a ditch of non sequiturs and failed to find the road again.\n\nHe was trying to remind viewers that Trump's tax cuts had drained the public finances, piling on trillions in new debt ( which is true ); and that he, unlike Trump, wants tax hikes for billionaires.\n\nHe appeared to start making the point that tax hikes on billionaires could improve services for all Americans, correcting himself after he erroneously referred to trillionaires.\n\nHe couldn't correct what came next: \"With the COVID \u2026 Excuse me \u2026 Look.\" There were painful pauses, the clock ticking, ticking, and Biden concluded with, \"We finally beat Medicare.\"\n\nWhat he appeared to be referring to was how he beat the drug companies , forcing them to negotiate lower prices for seniors through the old-age Medicare program.\n\nThis was a historic achievement for a U.S. president. It's just not clear how it connects to spending new tax revenue from billionaires, as it was a cost-saving measure.\n\nThere was a similar moment shortly thereafter. During an exchange about the surge in irregular migration across the southern border, Biden made dubious claims about the drop in crossings, then concluded in a trail of incomplete thoughts.\n\nAt this point, Trump started mocking his opponent's cognitive state.\n\n\"I really don't know what he said at the end of that sentence,\" Trump said. \"I don't think he knows what he said, either.\"\n\nWATCH | Biden tells Trump he has the 'morals of an alley cat': Biden to Trump: \u2018You have the morals of an alley cat\u2019 Duration 1:02 After former U.S. president Donald Trump brought up the criminal conviction of Hunter Biden and accused U.S. President Joe Biden of interfering in the proceedings, Biden called Trump\u2019s claims \u2018outrageous\u2019 and \u2018simply a lie.\u2019 Biden then brought up Trump\u2019s ongoing criminal and civil legal issues.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, hasn't changed a bit\n\nTrump's own weaknesses have less to do with his age. Despite being only three years younger \u2014 78 to Biden's 81 \u2014 Trump hasn't changed significantly, in appearance or in manner, since he first ran for president nearly a decade ago.\n\nHe exaggerated his own achievements, claiming the best economy in U.S. history under his watch. It was, in fact, a very good economy, until it collapsed during the pandemic, but by no major measure was it the best ever.\n\nHe also made wild accusations, calling Biden a criminal. Never mind that Trump himself is now a convict , faces scores more criminal charges, and has also been found liable for fraud and sexual assault \u2014 while his party has tried to investigate Biden for nearly two years and failed to find a reason to impeach him.\n\nTrump also shrugged off an attempt to talk about Jan. 6. When the topic came up, he said only that the country was better off on Jan. 6, 2021, when he was still president.\n\nHe denied referring to military veterans as suckers and losers, which some of his former aides suggest he did ; Biden, whose late son Beau was a veteran, expressed indignation: \"You're the sucker; you're the loser,\" he said.\n\nWATCH | Trump on if he'll accept the election results: Trump says he\u2019ll accept 2024 results \u2018if it\u2019s a fair and legal and good election\u2019 Duration 0:43 Former U.S. president Donald Trump was repeatedly asked during a debate in Atlanta that aired on CNN if he will accept the results of the 2024 presidential election. During his reply, Trump said he would \u2014 on certain conditions \u2014 before claiming he wasn\u2019t going to run initially. \u2018I would be very happy to be someplace else,\u2019 he said.\n\nTrump also wouldn't promise to accept the next election results without caveats, a once-unthinkable thing for a major presidential candidate to say.\n\nAt this point Biden managed a rare, sharp jab on a substantive point: \"I doubt you'll accept it \u2014 because you're such a whiner.\"\n\nBut the debate devolved into an unseemly argument about physical vigour, about which man was a better golfer, and who was fit enough to carry his own golf bag.\n\nThis rumble between present-day and soon-to-be octogenarians might not be the debate America dreamed of; it is, however, the debate America got.\n\nThere is one thing this spectacle might have achieved, though: It might have reduced the chances that, come election day on Nov. 5, Donald Trump will be whining about the results.\n\n\"There is more than hand-wringing tonight,\" McCaskill said on MSNBC. \"I do think people feel like we are confronting a crisis.\"",

Not so easily\nPressure is growing on Joe Biden to step aside after his poorly received performance in the first presidential debate against Donald Trump.\n\nWith November's election bearing down, a growing number of senior Democrats are speaking publicly or privately about their concerns.\n\nThe top two Democrats in the US Congress, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, have told him they fear he will be a drag on their members running for election.\n\nMore than 20 other lawmakers have publicly broken ranks, as have prominent supporters and party donors.\n\nMr Biden has in recent weeks defiantly vowed to stay in the race but now a Covid infection will sideline him for days.\n\nLet's run through the possible scenarios.",

Known for his accurate predictions of the 2008 Great Recession, Trump\u2019s 2016 Election win, and the Covid Crisis of 2020, Rickards now warns of social and economic chaos that could follow this election.\n\nRickards-New\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Rickards\n\n\u201cThe 2024 election is poised to be one of the most tumultuous events in American history,\u201d Rickards states. \u201cWe are facing the potential for a 50% market crash, the collapse of the US dollar, and widespread civil unrest. The time to prepare is now.\u201d\n\nKey points of Ex CIA Rickards\u2019 urgent warning:\n\nElection-Triggered Market Crash: Rickards foresees a massive stock market downturn, with potential losses exceeding 50%, and a significant devaluation of the US dollar. Civil Unrest and Possible Martial Law: His forecast includes a high probability of violent riots and social disorder, possibly leading to the imposition of martial law and temporary suspension of civil rights. Immediate Action Required: Rickards outlines five essential steps Americans should take immediately to protect their wealth and personal safety. Proven Track Record: With a history of accurate predictions, Rickards\u2019 insights and strategies are based on extensive experience and expertise.\n\nThe 2024 Presidential Election could be the \u2018Tipping Point\u2019\n\nRickards outlines several reasons as to why the stock market could fall at any moment following the election.\n\nElection Chaos and Legal Challenges : Rickards suggests that the 2024 Presidential Election could be similar to the 2000 election but on a much larger scale. This could lead to a prolonged period of uncertainty, causing investors to panic and sell off their stocks.\n\nRefusal to Transfer Power and Civil Unrest: If Trump wins the election, but is prevented from taking office by the current establishment, Rickards predicts widespread civil unrest to break out. Violent protests, clashes with law enforcement, and potential declarations of martial law could create tremendous fear and uncertainty, driving a massive sell-off in the stock market.\n\nCollapse of the US Dollar : Rickards foresees a scenario where the political instability resulting from election chaos and civil unrest leads to a loss of confidence in the US dollar. As investors seek safer assets, there could be a rapid devaluation of the dollar, causing a fight from dollar-denominated assets, including stocks.\n\nIncreasing Inflation: We still have an inflation problem. The combination of government spending, policies, and political instability could lead to hyperinflation. Rickards warns that inflation could become \u201c1000 times worse\u201d than current levels, eroding the value of investments and causing a stock market crash as investors try to preserve their wealth.\n\nPolicy and Governance Issues: Rickards notes that we can not continue to sustain the current administration\u2019s policies on immigration and spending. If things remain, we could be headed towards economic instability. For instance, massive government spending could lead to a fiscal crisis, where the government is unable to service its debt, causing a loss of confidence in the financial system.\n\nHistorical Comparison: Rickards being one who successfully predicted the 2008 financial crisis, implies that similar systemic risks are present today. He suggests that underlying economic weaknesses, combined with political instability, could lead to a sudden market downturn similar to the collapse experienced in 2008.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAbout Jim Rickards Jim Rickards is a distinguished lawyer, economist, and investment banker with over five decades of experience on Wall Street and in international finance. He has advised the highest levels of government, including: the CIA, Pentagon, and White House. Jim has also authored several best-selling books on economic policy and financial markets. Known for his accurate predictions of the 2008 Great Recession, Trump\u2019s 2016 Election win, and the Covid Crisis of 2020, Rickards now warns of catastrophic consequences that could follow this election. Take the necessary next steps, NOW Jim has prepared an entire brief on how every American can prepare themselves for the potential economic and social destruction following the upcoming election.
