        "text": "Voting plays an important role in 2024 U.S. presidential election\nThe 2024 U.S. elections are going to be held on Tuesday, November 5, 2024. On this day, millions of Americans will be casting their ballots with their selected candidates. While the act of voting itself is not a complicated process, as long as you are registered to vote in the state of Illinois, its significance is still an integral part of how the country is going to be governed.\n\nRibhi Salhi is a political science professor at the College of Lake County (CLC) who specializes in topics such as politics in the Middle East and Southeast Asia, American national politics, and comparative politics.\n\n\u201cThe word \u201cvoting\u201d comes from the word \u201cfranchise,\u201d\u2019 he said. \u201cIt means the right to vote and the right to express your thoughts in an electoral democratic process.\u201d\n\nSalhi went on to explain that throughout history, voting has become universal suffrage. This means that each citizen is eligible and must have the opportunity to vote. This process first began in the Greek city state of Athens, with its respective elections and voting systems.\n\nIf one is to go down even deeper in the field of political science, one will find that most experts and political scientists, who discuss the roads of democracy, emphasize the role of motive.\n\n\u201cOne of them, for example, Robert Dahl, has a list of minimum democracy that says that the right to vote means that people must be given the opportunity to select a number of candidates to ensure that the government in the future will be their agent and will represent their demands and their needs,\u201d he said. \u201cThe role of government is to serve you.\u201d\n\nIn the case of the United States of America, the country\u2019s own journey of democracy went through many interesting events. Voting did not have the aspect of universality as it is often associated with today, as certain demographics, such as women and African Americans, were not given the right to.\n\n\u201cThis was considered a Whig democracy,\u201d Salhi said.\n\nSalhi emphasized that if one were to go throughout the history of the United States and the constitution, it eventually included them, such as the Fifteenth Amendment, which is the right to vote and to protect the rights of African Americans under the environment of slavery. Meanwhile, the Nineteenth Amendment came out in 1920, which gave women the right to vote as well.\n\nHe also pointed out that when American women were allowed to vote in 1920, women in the United Kingdom were given the same right in 1928.\n\n\u201cThat was kind of like inspiration for other feminist movements elsewhere in the world.\u201d Salhi said.\n\nBy 1971 and 1972, the United States adapted the Twenty-sixth Amendment, which allowed for both sexes, once they were eighteen years of age, to become eligible to vote.\n\nThere is also the on-going debate of whether or not an incarcerated person should be allowed to vote. The topic remains a heated discussion to this day as both sides share their perspectives. Salhi explained that this is because there has been a conflict of ideas between the conservatives and the liberals and the advocate and the non-advocate.\n\n\u201cSome people will argue that if a person takes another\u2019s life, they should not have the right to vote,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you could argue otherwise that they have the right to practice any religion, the right to go back to school, to eat, [to] smoke, and even make a phone call. So, why not give them the right to vote?\u201d\n\nFurthermore, he added that the reserved powers and the tenth amendment of the U.S. Constitution are part of the powers of the states.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the states have the right to create their own set of rules for the electoral laws and policies,\u201d Salhi said. \u201cThat\u2019s why some states ask you to register, while others don\u2019t. That\u2019s why some states enjoy and practice open primaries or closed primaries.\u201d\n\nVoting also correlates with American democracy due to the existence of Whig democracy, a specific type that only allows the wealthy to have political participation. Eventually, there was another wave called common democracy that formed around U.S. President Andrew Jackson, which spanned from generation to generation.\n\n\u201cWe start to find American democracy hits another wave of struggle and beliefs, which we call advanced democracy.\u201d\n\nSalhi cited examples of this type with giving women the right to vote in the early 20th century, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, bilingual voting, which allowed voters to cast their ballots in their preferred language if they did not speak English, the media forces giving out information about the candidates, and the experts who explain the policy proposals.\n\n\u201cIn democracy, people create government, and government becomes [the] agent of their demands, and that\u2019s what leads the people to practice and to have the notion of oversight,\u201d Salhi said. \u201cIt empowers the rights of the people through popular sovereignty.\u201d\n\nSome of the basic things that people should know about voting are that it is associated with the following categories, which are divided by most political scientists: social and demographic characteristics, the surrounding political environment, and state electoral laws.\n\nSalhi stated a few instances of the first category, such as the Latino American demographic, who, despite some of them being undocumented, would be able to make a difference. Those who are living in rural areas and nursing homes might not feel motivated nor have the capability to go out and vote.\n\n\u201cWe have to have some mobility for all those people to enjoy this right,\u201d Salhi said.\n\nIn the second category, he pointed out that some people will not vote unless there is a controversial topic that has occurred in recent years, which influences the outcome of the election all the time.\n\n\u201cWe have the war in the Middle East, the war in Ukraine, the rise of China, and the two rival candidates, President Biden and former President Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that is going to drive people to vote for third-party candidates or go into the mindset that their vote does not count because the electoral college is the last resort to determining the presidency.\u201d\n\nSalhi added that one should keep in mind each respective state\u2019s electoral laws, which may present certain challenges for people.\n\nHe also stressed that the importance of voting has something to do with liberal democracy as it influences the election by voting for your preferred candidates and leads to the notion of political efficacy, which is achieved in one way by voting for the candidate that you think is going to meet your expectations, as the public has the ability to influence government and it is a mark of national pride.\n\n\u201cBecause that\u2019s your voice in democracy, and that\u2019s what makes the difference,\u201d he said.\n\nThe importance of voting is a sign of democracy and is used to practice one\u2019s constitutional rights, ensure a limited government that is under the control of the rules stated in the Constitution, and accept oversight.\n\n\u201cIt is given to you, as a citizen, for you to engage,\u201d Salhi said. \u201cAnd to keep your eyes on the government.\u201d\n\nVoting is still important to society in the 21st century because of its historic standing. By the end of the 1900s, the world experienced the end of communist rule in the Soviet Union and its eventual collapse, the steady rise of globalization, and the movement towards democratization.\n\nIn connection to this, Salhi shared that there are three waves of democracy that were identified by Samuel Huntington, a renowned American political scientist. The first wave was during the American Revolution, the British Glorious Revolution, and the French Revolution that occurred in the 1800s. The second wave was at the end of the Second World War, when the Axis Powers were pushed to become liberal democratic societies. Finally, the third wave occurred during the end of the Cold War and the disintegration of the Soviet Union.\n\n\u201cThese events, the changes, and the shift from authoritarianism to democracy\u2014we call it democratization,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what it means for the people to have the right to vote.\u201d\n\nBut Salhi also added that authoritarian systems, although they allow their respective citizens to vote, don\u2019t vote for political competitors. Instead, they are merely voting for a person who has already been decided. Many political scientists often label it a \u201cfake democracy\u201d if a nation allows the practice of voting but offers no limitations in governance.\n\n\u201cIn healthy and limited democracies, political competition is going to be there, and therefore, the interest in voting will increase,\u201d Salhi said. \u201cPolitical competition doesn\u2019t take place unless there is polarity in political candidates who represent all kinds of ideologies, like in third parties or in multiple parties in the system.\u201d\n\nThe biggest challenge in this scenario, according to Salhi, is to be educated and make up one\u2019s mind on which candidate to vote for.\n\nWhile some would still want to cast their vote, there will also be some who believe that their vote \u201cdoesn\u2019t matter\u201d and often do not participate. But how does one convince them to?\n\n\u201cThere are good tools to encourage people to vote,\u201d Salhi answered. \u201cOne of them is political mobilization, which is able to take on so many forms.\u201d\n\nHe cited a number of different scenarios where this could potentially take place.\n\n\u201cOne of them could be an influential speaker in a social gathering, which can be seen during election season; social media [can be one] because it has all kinds of platforms,\u201d he said. \u201cA community gathering could also be used, or even the new generations can explore more with this newfound technology we have.\u201d\n\nAside from that, Salhi also said that the influences on voters\u2019 behavior come from party identification, candidates\u2019 characteristics, and the issue of policy proposals.\n\n\u201cIf voters do not understand these three areas, they will experience several misconceptions,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile democracy is synonymous with the global conception of the United States, it does not appear anywhere in the constitution.\n\n\u201cThe framers did not use it,\u201d Salhi explained. \u201cWe have a republic; it means to have the rule of law, which is created by our representatives, who come into this office because of our vote.\u201d\n\nIn comparison to other nations around the world, which have many different political systems from one another and have their own flaws and shortcomings, there is no such thing as a perfect system.\n\n\u201cWe are human,\u201d Salhi said. \u201cWe make mistakes.\u201d\n\nHe argued that having a democracy is much better than having an authoritarian system that has oppressive elements attached to it. He emphasized that, despite its imperfections, the people have the principles of democratic institutions, the methods of government, and the roles for someone to run, which are much more ideal than having nothing.\n\nIn terms of the importance of the 2024 U.S. presidential elections, Salhi expressed that its importance is not just viewed domestically but internationally as well due to the country\u2019s reputation as a global superpower. As a result, any move that the U.S. could make can potentially have an impact around the world.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. is a major player in the global system,\u201d Salhi explained. \u201c[As a result], the U.S. presidential elections are deeply involved with foreign affairs such as the war in Ukraine, in the Middle East, and with its potential trade competitions in China.\u201d\n\nHe further explained that due to its status as a global leader for liberalism, human rights, and democracy, this has created more attention and more tension towards the United States.\n\nIn addition, the United States was able to maintain its position because it combined the two schools of thought, realism and idealism, and molded them into one in the concept of a \u201cgrand strategy,\u201d which allowed it to enhance its vital interests.\n\nDue to the rise of globalization and an increase of digital interconnectivity, Salhi also stated that in today\u2019s world, being aware of what is going on in politics isn\u2019t difficult to do.\n\n\u201cThe media is offering great sources to learn from and to be educated about,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also encouraged people who are bilingual and multilingual to find more sources in the languages that they understand.\n\n\u201cYou can have two sources of knowledge,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you can branch out that knowledge.\u201d\n\nHe shared his own experiences and said that he practices this in his spare time and is able to gather all of the data from the sources he has read about, filter them out, and go on from there.\n\nLastly, when asked what he wanted to say to the CLC community, he said that \u201cwe have the leaders of a better tomorrow.\u201d\n\nIf you want more information on how to register to vote and other related resources and topics, here is the link to the website of the Illinois State Board of Elections.

        "text": "Women Voters\u2019 Pivotal Role in Electing the Next U.S. President\nWomen voters will play a pivotal role in determining the outcome of the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Women comprise the largest group of registered voters, and they tend to turn out at high levels to vote, as 68.4 percent of them did in the 2020 election. The question is, where will women throw their weight?\n\nWhile former President Donald Trump is leading in many polls, the latest Quinnipiac poll shows President Joe Biden in a dead heat with Trump. In that poll, Biden captured 58 percent of the women\u2019s vote, a five-point gain over the last Quinnipiac poll in December. Trump\u2019s support from women declined by five points to 36 percent. That puts Biden ahead of his 2020 performance when he won 55 percent of the women\u2019s vote, compared to 44 percent of women who voted for Trump.\n\nBlack and Hispanic women voters provided Biden his winning edge in 2020, as 90 and 69 percent those blocs respectively voted for him. In contrast, Trump still retains the loyalty of a majority of white women, who form the largest single bloc of the electorate at 40 percent, and the largest subgroup of women voters.\n\nRenewing America Ideas and initiatives for renewing America\u2019s economic strength.

Trump\u2019s share of the white women vote in 2020 actually increased from 2016, when he garnered 39 percent. However, the recent South Carolina Republican primary indicated that Trump could be losing some of them. According to exit polls, a shocking 43 percent of women voted for Nikki Haley, despite the fact that Trump was widely forecast to win that contest by a significant margin. That signals a willingness to cast a protest vote against Trump (and likely some loyalty to their former state governor). Deep-red South Carolina will certainly not cross over to vote Democratic in November, but it may mean that some women are turned off enough by Trump to refrain from voting for him.\n\nWomen\u2019s rising discomfort with Trump could be due to several factors, including a jury finding him liable for sexual assault of E. Jean Carroll in a civil case and the imposition of an $88 million penalty by two juries. In addition, he continued to defame the plaintiff during and after the trial. He also repeatedly belittled and made racist and false comments about Haley, his own ambassador to the United Nations. Finally, the abortion issue could have opened a seam even in deep red South Carolina. While 51 percent of South Carolina Republicans support a total or near total abortion ban, significant differences could nonetheless exist\u2014including a reluctance to back a 15-week national abortion ban that Trump has pledged to seek. According to South Carolina exit polls, abortion was the top issue for 58 percent of those who voted for Haley, who has repeatedly warned her party that the votes for a national ban do not exist.\n\nIt has become clear that abortion rights are a significant issue animating voters in the battleground states that will determine the outcome of the election. The success of state-level measures defending abortion rights in Kansas, Michigan, Ohio, and elsewhere suggests that significant support for abortion and reproductive rights exist among women and men in red and purple states.\n\nAbortion is far from the only issue on women voters\u2019 minds, of course, although the stories of women facing life-threatening decisions continue to galvanize attention around the issue. Economic concerns predominate across the electorate, and younger voters in particular, including younger women, could choose not to vote for Biden over differences regarding his approach to the Israel-Hamas war. A third-party candidate in battleground states could also pose a significant challenge to Biden\u2019s reelection bid if the margins are close.\n\nAnother important subgroup is independent voters, who represent 43 percent of the total electorate; they are roughly divided between those who lean Republican and Democratic. The majority of independents identify as moderate or liberal, rather than conservative, including on social issues, according to the Pew Research Center. That suggests Biden could find some crossover votes if Republican leaners perceive Trump\u2019s positions as too extreme. He will certainly need to retain most of the Democratic leaners to win.\n\nBiden acknowledged the importance of women\u2019s votes in his State of the Union address, and the campaign is giving it new priority with Vice President Kamala Harris leading the charge.\n\nTurnout rates for women have a very good chance of reaching a historic high, not just due to the overturning of the fifty-year-old right to an abortion, but also because that ruling has been followed by an avalanche of actions that many women view as direct attacks on their rights and autonomy. These include state-level abortion bans and restrictions in twenty-four states, court rulings that prevent women from urgently needed abortions to protect their health, efforts to ban the abortion drug mifepristone and limit birth control, and laws that would prosecute women who leave states for abortion care and those who help them. The Alabama Supreme Court decision that frozen embryos are persons caused providers to suspend in vitro fertilization treatments. All of this could lead to a \u201cblue wave\u201d far exceeding the turnout in the 2022 midterms, and with it the possibility that the next president will owe his presidency to women turning out to express their views.\n\nThis post was written for the Council on Foreign Relations\u2019 Renewing America initiative\u2014an effort established on the premise that for the United States to succeed, it must fortify the political, economic, and societal foundations fundamental to its national security and international influence.

        "text": "Who might Trump pick to be vice president? Here are 7 possibilities\nThe presidential primary season is over, and now that former President Donald Trump has secured the Republican nomination, he's getting questions about who's on his VP short list and what qualities he's looking for in a running mate.\n\nIn February, while the primaries were still underway, Trump told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo that he wasn't planning to announce his choice \"for awhile.\" He said he was looking for someone who's \"able to be a good president\" and told Bartiromo he had been talking to a number of people and mentioned South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem.\n\nIn January, he'd said of his potential running mate, \"I know who it's going to be,\" but offered no further detail.\n\nMost candidates don't announce a running mate until the official nominating conventions are held in the summer, and Trump is expected to follow that precedent. Sources close to the Trump campaign say they have advised Trump to withhold announcing the nomination until the convention to build suspense and increase his leverage over candidates vying for the role.\n\nPotential picks whom sources within Trump's orbit have discussed for the role have been prominently featured on the campaign trail with the former president. Here are seven of them.\n\nNew York Rep. Elise Stefanik\n\nFile: GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York smiles as she arrives to vote for the new GOP conference chairperson at the Capitol in Washington, D.C. on May 14, 2021. MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images\n\nNew York Rep. Elise Stefanik is one of Trump's fiercest defenders. As the No. 4 House Republican, she was one of the first members of Congress to endorse Trump when he announced his third bid for the White House.\n\nThirty-nine year-old Stefanik is almost half the age of Trump, who is 77 years old. She is seen as someone who would carry the torch for the MAGA movement he began and has fought for Trump on numerous occasions as a key member of his impeachment defense team in 2019.\n\nIn January, she echoed Trump's characterization of jailed Jan. 6 defendants as \"hostages,\" and she's filed multiple ethics complaints against judges in cases involving the former president. Stefanik was one of 147 Republicans who voted against certifying the 2020 election results.\n\nSources tell CBS News that Trump sees Stefanik as a potential running mate. When asked whether she would serve as his vice president, Stefanik told NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" that she would be \"honored to serve in any capacity in a Trump administration.\"\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Tim Scott\n\nFile: Sen. Tim Scott (R) (R-SC) shakes hands with Republican presidential candidate and former President Donald Trump during a campaign rally at the Grappone Convention Center on January 19, 2024 in Concord, New Hampshire. Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images\n\nThe South Carolina senator dodged questions about being Trump's vice president when he was running for president himself. He dropped his bid for the White House in November, and he endorsed Trump just before the New Hampshire primary in a blow to fellow South Carolinian and former Gov. Nikki Haley, who appointed him to a vacant U.S. Senate seat.\n\nTrump told Bartiromo that he had called Scott and told him, \"'You are a much better candidate for me than you are for yourself.'\"\n\n\"We need Donald Trump,\" Scott told a crowd of Trump supporters at a Jan. 19 rally in Concord, New Hampshire. \"We need a president who will unite our country.\"\n\nTrump praised Scott as a \"man of faith, courage and conviction, a man who fought for those opportunities zones like nobody would ever fight and school choice and also taking care of the historically black colleges.\"\n\nScott,the highest-ranking Black Republican in the GOP, could help Trump court Black voters, traditionally a key Democratic voting bloc.\n\nScott told \"CBS Mornings\" that he would never ask for a cabinet position from Trump, but declined to answer whether he wants to serve as Trump's vice president.\n\n\"The one thing I want to do is make sure we win in 2024,\" he told \"CBS Mornings\" anchor Gayle King, \"I don't think about this from a personal perspective.\"\n\nSouth Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem\n\nFile: South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem speaks at Calvin Coolidge Foundation conference at Library of Congress on Feb. 17, 2023 in Washington, D.C. Anna Moneymaker / Getty Images\n\nNoem has been fiercely loyal to Trump and has long been mentioned as a vice presidential candidate. Hailing from the red state of South Dakota, Noem considered a 2024 presidential run, but ultimately decided not to pursue it when Trump announced he was running again.\n\n\"I think he's gonna run. And if President Trump runs, I'll support him,\" Noem told CBS News' Major Garrett in 2022.\n\nShe rose to prominence in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic when she refused to implement strict mask mandates in South Dakota.\n\nNoem was one of the first governors to endorse Trump, announcing she was backing him at a rally last September, and she campaigned for him several times in Iowa before the January caucuses. Noem told Newsmax in September that she would consider the vice presidential slot \"in a heartbeat.\" She also has close ties to MAGA world and with former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski.\n\nNorth Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum\n\nFile: North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, former President Donald Trump, Kathryn Burgum, North Dakota's first lady, left, during campaign event at Simpson College in Indianola, Iowa, on Jan. 14, 2024. Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nNorth Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum \u2014 another former 2024 presidential candidate \u2014 has also been raised by the Trump campaign as a potential running mate. Burgum was the first of the former 2024 presidential candidates to officially endorse Trump, joining him for a rally in Indianola, Iowa, on Jan. 14, the eve of before the caucuses, to announce his support.\n\nThe Trump team likes Burgum, who refrained from saying anything negative about the former president when he was a candidate himself. Burgum is seen as a solid conservative with credentials that could be a good fit for various cabinet positions, including vice president.\n\n\"He's one of the best governors in our country, and I hope that I'm going to be able to call on him to be a piece of the administration, a very important piece of the administration,\" Trump said of Burgum during the Jan. 14 rally.\n\nAs governor, Burgum signed into law a six-week abortion ban and legislation to restrict transgender rights. He's also a fiscal hawk who has cut state spending while enacting the largest tax cut in North Dakota history. He's led North Dakota since 2016 and announced in January that he would not seek a third term as governor.\n\nArkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders\n\nFile: Sarah Huckabee Sanders at Republican Jewish Coalition, in Las Vegas, Nevada, Nov. 6, 2021. Bridget Bennett/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nThe former Trump administration official and current governor of Arkansas is another young, female conservative likely being considered by Trump for the ticket. Sanders, 41, is the youngest governor in the country and is seen as a rising star in the party who can speak to suburban women. Last year, Sanders delivered the Republican response to President Biden's State of the Union address. She officially endorsed Trump during a campaign rally in Hialeah, Florida, in November 2023.\n\nBut Sanders has dismissed the idea of serving as vice president. When asked by \"Face the Nation\" moderator Margaret Brennan if she'd say yes to joining the Trump ticket, Gov. Sanders said, \"I am honored to serve as governor, and I hope I get to do it for the next seven years.\"\n\nFormer HUD Secretary Dr. Ben Carson\n\nFile: Former HUD Secretary Ben Carson campaigns for former President Donald Trump at the Grace Baptist Church on January 11, 2024 in Marion, Iowa. Anna Moneymaker / Getty Images\n\nCarson, a renowned neurosurgeon and former secretary of Housing and Urban Development, was one of the longest-serving cabinet secretaries during Trump's administration. Carson remained loyal to the former president after Jan. 6, when several cabinet secretaries resigned in protest, citing the attack on the Capitol.\n\nCarson \u2014 who ran against Trump in the 2016 presidential primary \u2014 campaigned for the former president in Iowa before the caucuses. The devout Christian told a church full of Trump supporters to look less at Trump's words and more at what he has accomplished when voting for him.\n\n\"He's a strong believer. Now, sometimes that might not be reflected in his speech, but I always say, 'Isn't it better to look at what a person does?'\" Carson said.\n\nCarson is seen as someone who would be a safe choice for vice president, since he is well-liked by conservatives and Christians. In response to whether he and Trump have had discussions about serving as vice president, Carson said, \"I don't want to speak about private conversations.\"\n\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., speaks with members of the media as he walks, Wednesday, Feb. 28, 2024, at the Capitol in Washington. Mark Schiefelbein / AP\n\nThe senior senator from Florida \u2013 and ex-2016 presidential rival to Trump \u2013 is also under consideration as a potential running mate in 2024. Rubio, the son of two Cuban immigrants, is seen as someone who could help the campaign in appealing to Latino voters.\n\nRubio endorsed Trump the day before the Iowa caucuses in a post on X, and referenced working with Trump on the expanded Child Tax Credit and sanctions on Venezuela and Cuba during his presidency.\n\n\"I support Trump because that kind of leadership is the ONLY way we will get the extraordinary actions needed to fix the disaster Biden has created,\" Rubio wrote.\n\nIn an interview with Glenn Beck on March 21, Rubio said that he hadn't spoken to Trump or his campaign about being considered for vice president.\n\n\"The reason I'm in public service and the reason why I even ran for reelection \u2014 it's a six-year contract you sign when you come here \u2014 is I still want to save this country,\" Rubio said. \"I love this country with all my heart. It changed the life of my family and the trajectory of my family. I mean, I'm not saying that people whose families were born here don't love the country this well, but when your parents came from somewhere else, you realize that but for the grace of God and the existence of America, how different my life would have been. I think this country is in a lot, a lot of trouble.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time Rubio's been on the short list for vice president. The Florida senator was also a top contender to be on the ticket with Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP nominee. Romney ended up choosing then Wisconsin GOP Rep. Paul Ryan on their failed White House bid.\n\nSources in Rubio's office declined to comment.",

        "text": "Shirley 2024: Cast, Release Date, Shirley Chisholm True Story and Ending Explained - Netflix Tudum\nRegina King is running. The Oscar winner stars as political trailblazer Shirley Chisholm in a new film chronicling her groundbreaking run for president of the United States. In 1972, Chisholm became the first Black candidate to seek a major party\u2019s nomination for president. But she was already a pioneer: In 1968, the Brooklyn native made history as the first Black woman elected to the U.S. Congress. Written and directed by John Ridley (also an Oscar winner for his 12 Years a Slave screenplay), Shirley tells Chisholm\u2019s inspirational story.\n\nIn the trailer for Shirley, above, you can see King\u2019s transformation into Chisholm, as well as get a taste of her fiery spirit. \u201cYou sound just like every other politician,\u201d a voter tells Chisholm. \u201cDo I look like every other politician?\u201d she asks. Read on to find out more about Shirley.\n\nWhat is Shirley about?\n\nShirley tells the story of the first Black congresswoman, political icon Shirley Chisholm, and her trailblazing run for president. It chronicles her audacious, boundary-breaking 1972 presidential campaign.\n\nShirley Trailer\n\nWho was Shirley Chisholm?\n\nSisters, co-stars, and co-producers Regina and Reina King made Shirley to answer that very question. \u201cYou learned about Malcolm X, and you learned about Martin Luther King in U.S. history classes, but not this great, powerful woman,\u201d Reina King told Netflix. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t students being told about that? When I would mention Shirley\u2019s name, no one seemed to know who she was, and [that] lit a fire under us even more. We were like, \u2018The world should know, the country should know, women should know, people should know, kids should know.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIn that spirit, to reiterate once more: Shirley Chisholm was the first Black congresswoman elected to the U.S. House of Representatives and the first Black candidate to seek a major party\u2019s nomination, in the 1972 campaign covered in Shirley.\n\nBorn in Brooklyn in 1924, Chisholm spent much of her childhood with family in Barbados, developing a West Indian accent that would stay with her into adulthood. \u201cHaving spent time in Barbados and New York, she would sound Bajan sometimes and other times like someone from Brooklyn, and other times she sounded more scholarly, and sometimes it was a mix of all three because that\u2019s who she was,\u201d Regina King said. \u201cWorking with the dialect coach we said, \u2018You\u2019re not trying to mimic Shirley. What we need to do is find where Regina and Shirley intersect,\u2019 because that\u2019s what Shirley was always doing. She was always finding how she was going to meet whoever she was talking to where they were.\u201d\n\nThe team was also keen to depict Chisholm\u2019s sense of humor and style alongside her more serious moments. \u201cIn all of the research that we had done on Shirley and the people that we got to talk to who actually knew Shirley, the one thing they all said was that she loved to dance and that she was funny,\u201d Regina King said. \u201cBarbara Lee and Shirley\u2019s goddaughter told us that they\u2019ve never seen anyone that can curse someone out so well without using curse words.\u201d\n\nIs Shirley based on a true story?\n\nYes. Because Chisholm died in 2005, the filmmakers had to look to other sources. \u201cMost of the research we did was through her books, including Unbought and Unbossed and The Good Fight, documentaries, any news footage and articles, everything that we could pull to put us in the place that told us who Shirley was, and what was important to tell about her story,\u201d Reina King said.\n\nBut the film set did receive a visit from one of the people portrayed in Shirley: U.S. Representative Barbara Lee (D-CA). Lee got her start working on Chisholm\u2019s presidential campaign and is played in the film by Christina Jackson. \u201cHaving Barbara Lee come and visit the set was definitely like she was giving us Shirley\u2019s blessing in a lot of ways,\u201d Regina King said. \u201cBarbara represents just how someone can come into your life and not only inspire you, but kind of put a lightbulb in your head to let you know, \u2018Oh, this is what I\u2019m supposed to be doing. There is something within me that I have to give way beyond just this moment.\u2019 Shirley lit that fire in Barbara by example.\u201d\n\nTo learn more about Shirley\u2019s legacy and ways to take action, please visit Shirley1972.com.\n\nWhat does \u201cUnbought and Unbossed\u201d mean?\n\nChisholm\u2019s campaign slogan, \u201cUnbought and Unbossed,\u201d reflected her individual spirit and a promise to voters that she would work for them, rather than for wealthy special interests. It was also the title of her 1970 autobiography.\n\n\u201cI feel like she embodied that by marching to her own drummer,\u201d Reina King said. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t doing what was necessarily thought of for a woman to be doing at that time. She worked outside of the confines of the way things are supposed to go in politics, and no one was going to stop her from using her voice and getting out a message that was so important. She was just a maverick, a Goliath.\u201d\n\nWhat happens at the end of Shirley?\n\nShirley comes to a head at the end of the presidential primary: the 1972 Democratic National Convention, held in Miami Beach, Florida. At this point in the film, most people inside and outside Chisholm\u2019s campaign have conceded that victory is impossible. But hope emerges from an unlikely series of allies.\n\nFirst, a number of campaigns embark on a desperate bid to free up California\u2019s haul of winner-take-all delegates, held by frontrunner George McGovern. Then, one of Chisholm\u2019s primary opponents drops out and pledges their Black delegates to her campaign. Chisholm finds herself in a surprising position: She may not be able to win the primary, but if the convention extends past a first ballot, an influx of delegates could put her in a position to influence the Democratic Party\u2019s platform. At a meeting of Black delegates she implores the room to exercise political power by holding on to their votes.\n\nUnfortunately, it isn\u2019t meant to be. Chisholm loses the support of Rep. Walter Fauntroy (Andr\u00e9 Holland), who had pledged his delegates to her \u2014 but only in the event that the convention proceeded past a first ballot. Fauntroy slides through that loophole by instead pledging his delegates to McGovern on the first ballot. More upsettingly, Chisholm\u2019s friend and colleague Ron Dellums (Dorian Crossmond Missick) appears on television and pushes for delegates to support McGovern. With that, the campaign is over. Chisholm tells her team to release her delegates and retreats to her room, where she pledges to forgive Ron for succumbing to the political pressures she knows he must be facing.\n\nIt\u2019s a pivotal moment in Chisholm\u2019s career, and in the history of representative politics. Soon she\u2019s surrounded by her team, and she leaves them with a piece of wisdom: \u201cIf I can\u2019t get there today, you have to believe you can get there tomorrow.\u201d They take it to heart: Lee (Jackson), seated next to Chisholm, will go on to have her own congressional career. In the film\u2019s final scene, Lee appears as herself \u2014 one of the many who, to this day, continue to honor Chisholm\u2019s legacy.\n\nWho is in the cast of Shirley?\n\nRegina King as Shirley Chisholm About the Character King, who won an Oscar in 2018 for her gorgeous and understated turn in Barry Jenkins\u2019 If Beale Street Could Talk, takes on the role of the gutsy politician in Shirley. She and her sister, Reina (who also co-stars as Chisholm\u2019s sister), co-produced the film; it\u2019s been a passion project of theirs for years. \u201cReina and I first decided that Shirley\u2019s story was one that was important to tell when we realized separately and together how many people did not know who Shirley was,\u201d King told Netflix. \u201cSo often we only do things because we\u2019ve seen someone else do it. That\u2019s what lets us know that it\u2019s possible, as opposed to creating our own possibilities. Shirley was a maverick in that space. So, hopefully she would understand that that\u2019s the reason for telling this story.\u201d Previously In Jerry Maguire, Watchmen, If Beale Street Could Talk, Friday, Ray, Enemy of the State, The Leftovers, The Boondocks Watch them on Netflix Watch My List Watch My List Follow Regina King\n\nTerrence Howard as Arthur Hardwick About the Character Chisholm-campaign fundraiser and advisor Arthur Hardwick is played by Oscar-nominee Terrence Howard. He\u2019s a steadfast supporter who understands how inspiring the very existence of her campaign will be. Previously In Iron Man, Hustle & Flow, Ray, Prisoners, Empire, Four Brothers, Crash, Big Momma\u2019s House, Lee Daniels\u2019 The Butler, August Rush\n\nLance Reddick as Wesley \u201cMac\u201d Holder About the Character The late, great Lance Reddick plays Chisholm\u2019s loyal campaign advisor Wesley. Shirley was one of the final projects Reddick completed before his untimely death in 2023. He also appeared in King\u2019s feature-film directorial debut One Night in Miami\u2026 in 2020. \u201cLance really was a spirit that knew how to lift me up. He also helped me to remember to laugh,\u201d King said. \u201cThere are moments in the film where I see Shirley and Mac looking at each other and I see Lance and Regina looking at each other, and that\u2019s what will always be on film for me. I\u2019ll always have that. I\u2019m speaking selfishly, I know, to watch Lance cap off this amazing career that he had is a gift for me.\u201d Previously In The Wire, The Guest, White House Down, The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial, Fringe, Oz, Lost Watch them on Netflix Watch My List Follow Lance Reddick\n\nLucas Hedges as Robert Gottlieb About the Character A former congressional intern, Gottlieb takes on the role of youth coordinator in Chisholm\u2019s fledgling presidential campaign. He\u2019s played by Oscar-nominee Lucas Hedges. Previously In Manchester by the Sea, Lady Bird, Honey Boy, Moonrise Kingdom, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri Watch them on Netflix Watch My List\n\nAndr\u00e9 Holland as Walter Fauntroy About the Character Congressional delegate Walter Fauntroy is a stickler for the rules whose gamesmanship rubs up against Chisholm\u2019s idealistic presidential campaign. He\u2019s played by Andr\u00e9 Holland, who brought sultry passion to Moonlight with just a glance and a lit cigarette. Previously In Moonlight, Bones and All, Selma, 42, A Wrinkle in Time, Miracle at St. Anna, Black or White, Bride Wars, Castle Rock Watch them on Netflix Watch My List Watch My List Watch My List Follow Andr\u00e9 Holland\n\nBrian Stokes Mitchell as Stanley Thompson About the Character Chisholm-campaign manager Thompson chafes against his candidate\u2019s increasingly unorthodox strategies. He\u2019s played by Tony-winner Brian Stokes Mitchell (who won for Kiss Me, Kate in 2000). Previously In The Prince of Egypt, Trapper John, M.D., Frasier, Glee, Mr. Robot, Billions, The Good Fight Watch them on Netflix Watch My List Follow Brian Stokes Mitchell\n\nMichael Cherrie as Conrad Chisholm About the Character Conrad Chisholm stands by his wife as she begins her run for president, but as time passes and money grows short, the pair struggle under the burden of Shirley\u2019s campaign. Stage and screen performer Michael Cherrie plays Conrad. Previously In She Paradise, Limbo Follow Michael Cherrie\n\nChristina Jackson as Barbara Lee About the Character Played by Christina Jackson, Barbara Lee is a campaign employee who brings a dash of her radical politics to Chisholm\u2019s strict operation. The real Barbara Lee is a current California representative who visited the set of Shirley. \u201cHaving Barbara Lee come and visit the set was definitely like she was giving us Shirley\u2019s blessing,\u201d King said. \u201cThe fact that Barbara Lee is still making moves that affect our lives as a Congresswoman is huge, and to know that it started with meeting Shirley that one time. So we looked at this film as a rallying cry and to show, by example, a snapshot of this relationship between these two women and how it\u2019s continued to nourish us.\u201d Previously In The Night House, Devotion, Outsiders, Deception Follow Christina Jackson\n\nReina King as Muriel St. Hill About the Character King\u2019s sister, Reina King, plays Chisholm\u2019s sister Muriel, one of her harshest critics. Frustrated by a campaign she sees as quixotic, Muriel isn\u2019t afraid to let her sister know. Reina also serves as co-producer on the film, and never expected to appear in it \u2014 she hasn\u2019t acted since 1998. \u201cI never thought that I was going to be in this film,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had been auditioning people to play Muriel and no one was quite cutting it. I blame this all on John Ridley. We were at a location scout and he steps to me and says, \u2018Reina, you and Regina are sisters. Why don\u2019t you do Muriel?\u2019 And my first thought was, \u2018No, that\u2019s not what I want to do.\u2019 And then it just happened and it made sense.\u201d It was their first time on-screen together.

        "text": "2024 Pakistani general election\nElections for the 16th National Assembly of Pakistan\n\nGeneral elections, originally scheduled to be held in 2023,[4] were held in Pakistan on 8 February 2024 to elect the members of the 16th National Assembly. The Election Commission of Pakistan announced the detailed schedule on 15 December 2023.[5]\n\nThe elections were held following two years of political unrest after Prime Minister Imran Khan of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) was removed from office by a no-confidence motion. Subsequently, Khan was arrested and convicted for corruption and barred from politics for five years. In the run-up to the elections, a Supreme Court ruling stripped the PTI of their electoral symbol for failing to hold intra-party elections for years.[6][7][8][9]\n\nOn election night, television broadcasts showed PTI-backed independent candidates leading in at least 127 national assembly seats, which hinted at a potential majority. However, the announcement of final results was abruptly halted.[10] Subsequently, independent candidates ended up winning 103 general seats including 93 backed by the PTI, followed by 75 from the Pakistan Muslim League (N) (PML-N) and 54 from the Pakistan People's Party (PPP). In Punjab and Sindh provinces, the PML-N and the PPP respectively emerged as the largest parties. Independent candidates backed by the PTI won the most number of seats in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa while Balochistan voted for the PPP and the PML-N as the largest parties. Later all parties except the PTI were given reserved seats for women and minorities.\n\nThe Military Establishment was accused of rigging in favour of the PML-N's leader Nawaz Sharif to keep the PTI's leader Imran Khan out of the electoral race.[11][12][13][14][15] Observer groups and members of the international community, including the United States, United Kingdom and the European Union, have voiced their concerns about the fairness of the elections,[16][17] while media outlets around the world denounced the election as \"fraudulent\".[18]\n\nPTI chair Gohar Ali Khan alleged election rigging and claimed that the party had won 180 National Assembly seats as per provisional election results.[19] PTI-backed independent candidates did not secure a majority, but they managed to win more seats than any other single party.[20] Imran Khan also cited alleged election rigging, and declined to forge alliances with other parties to establish a coalition government and instead opted to assume an opposition role in parliament.[21]\n\nAt a press conference on 13 February 2024, it was announced by the leaders of the PML-N and the PPP that they would form a coalition government with the PML-N's Shehbaz Sharif as prime minister.[22] The Muttahida Qaumi Movement \u2013 Pakistan (MQM-P), the Pakistan Muslim League (Q) (PML-Q), the Istehkam-e-Pakistan Party (IPP) and the Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) also expressed their intent to join the governmental coalition.[23] On 3 March, Shehbaz Sharif was re-elected as Prime Minister of Pakistan for the second time, securing 201 votes against the 92 votes received by the PTI-backed Omar Ayub Khan. With no party securing a majority in the assembly, Shehbaz became prime minister with support from the PML-N's allies, including the PPP, MQM-P, PML-Q, BAP, IPP and other smaller parties.[24]\n\nBackground\n\n2018 elections\n\nGeneral elections were held in Pakistan on 25 July 2018 after the completion of a five-year term by the outgoing government. At the national level, elections were held in 272 constituencies, each electing one member to the National Assembly. At the provincial level, elections were held in each of the four provinces to elect Members of the Provincial Assemblies (MPA).[25]\n\nAs a result of the elections, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) became the single largest party at the national level in terms of both popular vote and seats. At the provincial level, the PTI remained the largest party in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP); the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) remained the largest party in Sindh and the newly-formed Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) became the largest party in Balochistan. In Punjab, a hung parliament prevailed with Pakistan Muslim League (N) (PML-N) emerging as the largest party in terms of directly elected seats by a narrow margin.[26] However, following the support of the Pakistan Muslim League (Q) and the joining of independent MPAs into the PTI, the latter became the largest party and was able to form the government.[27]\n\n2022 constitutional crisis\n\nOn 8 March 2022, the opposition parties, under the banner of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), submitted a motion of no confidence against Prime Minister Imran Khan to the National Assembly's secretariat.[28][29] On 27 March 2022, Khan waved a diplomatic cypher from US in the public,[30] claiming that it demanded the removal of Khan's government in a coup.[31] Later he changed his stance about the US conspiracy against his government, in an effort to mend ties with the country.[32][33] However, in August 2023, The Intercept claimed to have published the contents of the diplomatic cable which had American diplomat Donald Lu on record as stating that \"all will be forgiven\" concerning the country's neutrality in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, if the no-confidence motion against Khan were to succeed.[34] After the election, JUI-F president Fazal-ur-Rehman, a critic of Imran Khan, claimed that the motion of no-confidence to remove Khan was introduced on the instructions of former army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa.[35][36]\n\nOn 1 April 2022, Prime Minister Khan announced that in the context of the no-confidence motion against him in the National Assembly, the three options were discussed with \"establishment\" to choose from viz: \"resignation, no-confidence [vote] or elections\".[37] On 3 April 2022, President Arif Alvi dissolved the National Assembly of Pakistan on Khan's advice after the Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly rejected and set-aside the motion of no confidence; this move would have required elections to the National Assembly to be held within 90 days.[38][39] On 10 April, after a Supreme Court ruling that the no-confidence motion was illegally rejected, a no-confidence vote was conducted and he was ousted from office,[40][41] becoming the first prime minister in Pakistan to be removed from office by a vote of no confidence.[42][43][44] Khan claimed the United States was behind his removal because he conducted an independent foreign policy and had friendly relations with China and Russia. His removal led to protests from his supporters across Pakistan.[45][46][47]\n\nPDM government\n\nAfter the success of the no-confidence motion, on 11 April 2022, Shehbaz Sharif became the Prime Minister after receiving 174 votes out of a total of 342, two more than the required majority with the support of the Pakistan People's Party, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam and various smaller parties under the coalition of the PDM. Dissident members of PTI also supported his candidature. Meanwhile, the remaining PTI members, who were now in the opposition, boycotted the session terming it a continuation of a \"foreign conspiracy\".[48] A day later, over 100 PTI members tendered resignations from their National Assembly seats.[49]\n\nThe PDM government remained in power until 10 August 2023. Sharif's tenure was marked by historically high inflation, contraction of the national economy, and a record devaluation of the Pakistani rupee.[50][51][52]\n\nAssassination attempt on Imran Khan and his subsequent arrest\n\nFollowing its ouster from the government, PTI continued to enjoy mass popularity with its supporters taking to the streets across the country.[53] In July 2022, during a provincial by-election in Punjab, the party had a landslide victory after winning 15 of the 20 seats. During October 2022 by-elections conducted for the National Assembly, the party won 7 out of 9 seats with Khan winning 6 of the 7 seats he was contesting for.[54] Later in the year, Khan himself led a well-attended march of protest throughout the populous province of Punjab, to force an early general election.[55] However, on 3 November 2022, while he was leading the march through Wazirabad, he was shot at and injured in an attempted assassination.[56]\n\nAs Khan was recovering from the gunshot wounds to his leg, the government registered several cases against him and attempted to arrest him from his home in Zaman Park on two different occasions during March 2023. Each time the police were unable to arrest him as his supporters intervened.[57] Then on 9 May 2023, he was violently arrested by paramilitary forces while marking his attendance at Islamabad High Court in a corruption case. The arrest came a day after the country's army warned him for accusing a high-ranking member of the ISI, Major General Faisal Naseer, of being responsible for the assassination attempt in November 2022.[58] Nationwide violence followed, in what were termed as the May 9 riots, with some demonstrators targeting military installations.[59] Following the events, a crackdown was initiated against the party by the country's military establishment. PTI leaders, party workers, and supporters, as well as those perceived to be allied to the party's cause within the media and legal profession, were targeted.[60][61] Trials of civilians within military courts were also initiated.[62] Several core leaders of the party have been in hiding since, with many incarcerated or forced to abandon the party.[60] Subsequently, two pro-establishment splinter groups emerged from within the PTI, namely the PTI Parliamentarians (PTI-P), led by Pervez Khattak, and the Istehkam-e-Pakistan Party (IPP), led by Jahangir Tareen.[63][64]\n\nOn 16 February 2024, former Secretary of Defense Naeem Khalid Lodhi claimed that the military establishment had indirectly contacted Imran Khan in which Khan was reportedly asked to admit responsibility and apologize for planning the May 9 riots and assure that such actions would not be repeated in the future. However, according to Lodhi, no resolution came from these interactions.[65]\n\nSchedule controversies\n\nIn January 2023, in a bid to force early general elections, the PTI prematurely dissolved the provincial assemblies it was in power in \u2013 namely Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. According to the constitution of Pakistan, after the dissolution of an assembly, elections are supposed to be held there within 90 days, thus, constitutionally limiting the date for the two provincial elections to be no later than April 2023.[66][67] However, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) delayed the elections to October 2023, citing lack of funds provided by the PDM government and the unavailability of the required security personnel.[68][69] The PTI approached the Supreme Court of Pakistan against the electoral body's decision, terming it a violation of the constitution, and with a majority verdict the court declared the ECP's earlier ruling as unconstitutional and ordered it to hold elections by 14 May 2023.[70] After the nationwide May 9 riots that broke out following Imran Khan's arrest \u2013 the election date passed without the Supreme Court order being enforced. On 30 May, after the passage of a new law, the PDM government filed a review petition against the court's earlier ruling.[71]\n\nOn 10 August 2023, the National Assembly was prematurely dissolved by the President Arif Alvi on the advice of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. This meant that the election must be held no later than 8 November 2023.[72][73] However, on 5 August 2023, the results of the 2023 digital census were approved by the Council of Common Interests headed by Shehbaz Sharif.[74] Therefore, elections were to be delayed to February 2024 at the latest, as announced by the ECP in order to carry out fresh electoral delimitations in light of the approved census results.[75][76] Despite that, on 13 September 2023, President Alvi proposed 6 November 2023 as a date to the ECP and advised it to seek guidance from the Supreme Court for the announcement of the election date.[77] On 2 November 2023, the ECP and the President agreed on 8 February 2024 as the date for the general election.[78][79]\n\nReturn of Nawaz Sharif to electoral politics\n\nAt the start of May 2023, the PDM government adopted a law allowing for filing review petitions against prior Supreme Court verdicts.to[80] At the end of June, another law, limiting disqualification to five years, was adopted. It also allows the electoral commission to announce the date of an election without consulting the President of the country.[81]\n\nAfter serving 12 months of his 7-year sentence on corruption charges, former prime minister Nawaz Sharif left the country on 19 November 2019 to receive medical treatment in London, promising to return in 4 weeks.[82] He was declared a fugitive in 2021 after failing to appear before courts despite summons.[83] Sharif obtained protective bail on 19 October 2023, which allowed him to return from 4 years of self-imposed exile without being arrested.[84] On October 21, he returned to the country where he was welcomed in Lahore by a gathering of tens of thousands of his supporters.[85]\n\nOn 9 January 2024, a seven-member Supreme Court bench under Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa, hearing a review petition against lifetime disqualification, announced a 6\u20131 majority verdict with Justice Yahya Afridi dissenting. The verdict set aside the earlier Supreme Court interpretation of lifetime disqualification for article 62(1)(f) of the constitution, stating that it violated fundamental rights, and instead set a five-year disqualification following the newly passed laws for lawmakers who fail the moral standard of \"sadiq and ameen\" (honest and righteous).[86] The timing of the verdict ensured that Sharif, who was disqualified for life in the Panama Papers case in 2017, is eligible to contest these elections with a possible fourth term as prime minister.[87]\n\nCampaign\n\nPTI de facto ban through intra-party election verdict\n\nOn 22 December 2023, the ECP decided against allowing the PTI to keep its electoral symbol, asserting that the party had failed to conduct intra-party elections to the commission's satisfaction. Subsequently, on the same day, the PTI appealed to the Peshawar High Court (PHC) challenging the ECP's decision. Consequently, a single-member bench suspended the ECP's order until 9 January 2024. On 30 December 2023, the ECP submitted a review application to the PHC. In the following days, a two-member bench lifted the suspension order while hearing the case. However, on 10 January 2024, the two-member bench deemed the ECP's order \"illegal, without any lawful authority, and of no legal effect.\" Responding to this, on 11 January, the ECP contested the ruling in the Supreme Court.[88]\n\nOn 13 January, a three-member panel of the Supreme Court, headed by Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa, sided with the ECP, reinstating their initial decision to deny the PTI its election symbol, the cricket bat, due to the party's failure to conduct intra-party elections by its constitution. Consequently, the PTI was unable to allocate party tickets to any of its candidates, resulting in all party candidates being listed as independent candidates with individual electoral symbols.[89] The party also lost the right to nominate candidates for 226 reserved seats across the central and provincial legislatures.[90] Removing the cricket bat symbol was viewed as preventing voters from recognising the party on ballot papers\u2014a crucial factor in Pakistan where 40 per cent of the population is illiterate.[91]\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision led some legal experts to describe the ruling as a \"huge blow to fundamental rights\" and \"a defeat for democratic norms.\"[92]\n\nImran Khan's convictions\n\nIn the week before the elections, Imran Khan was sentenced to jail terms in three separate cases. On 30 January 2024, with the government seeking a death penalty, he was sentenced to 10 years in a case dealing with the handling of state secrets by Judge Abul Hasnat Zulqarnain.[93] A day later, Judge Muhammad Bashir, sentenced him and his wife, Bushra Bibi, to a jail term of 14 years, along with a fine of Rs. 787 million (US$2.7 million) each for retaining a jewellery set that was a state gift from Saudi Arabia against an undervalued assessment from the country's Toshakhana. The ruling also barred Khan from holding public office for 10 years.[94] Two days later, Judge Qudratullah declared the marriage of Khan and his wife against Islamic law and sentenced both to prison for a term of seven years for allegedly solemnising their marriage during Bushra's Iddah period. The case was lodged on the complaint of Khawar Maneka, Bushra's former husband, five years after her marriage to Khan.[95]\n\nAll three trials were held behind closed doors in Adiala Jail, where Khan has been incarcerated since August 2023 on corruption charges, and were marked with rushed proceedings, sudden replacement of defendant's lawyers with state consuls, and other procedural irregularities that led his party to term the decisions to be coming from \"kangaroo courts\".[96][97][98] Khan's sentencing in the marriage case was decried by lawyers and members of the civil society as an overreach and a blow to women's rights.[99][100][101] Meanwhile, some observers termed the sentencings as a continuation of the Pakistani military's engineering to keep Khan out of power in the upcoming elections.[102][103][104] On election day, a PTI official said Khan had been allowed to vote in prison using a postal ballot.[105]\n\nAllegations of pre-poll rigging\n\nSome observers, including the United Nations and Human Rights Watch, have pointed to what appears to be pre-poll rigging in the run-up to the upcoming elections. There have been notable actions against the PTI and its leaders, including snatching of nomination papers, arbitrary arrests of candidates and their supporters, systematic rejection of nomination papers, and disruption of campaign events. This situation has led to widespread allegations of 'election engineering' and manipulative practices that could potentially favour certain political groups, casting doubts over the fairness of the electoral process.[106][103][107][108] Pakistan's electoral commission was also accused of gerrymandering in favour of the PML-N during the redrawing of voter maps before the elections, with a record 1,300 complaints made.[109]\n\nMany candidates affiliated with the PTI complained that following the ban on the usage of the cricket bat as the party's logo for the ballots, the electoral commission provided them with symbols carrying obscure meanings and sometimes awkward connotations such as a calculator, an electric heater, a dice, a bed, an eggplant, which is deemed anatomically suggestive, and a bottle, which carries suggestions of alcohol consumption in the majority-Muslim country.[110][111] This forces some of them to highlight their assigned symbols to voters, particularly those living in rural areas, on TikTok.[112]\n\nNumerous PTI candidates were reportedly beaten and imprisoned, while many were compelled to join opposing parties or quit politics entirely. A strict order was given to stop mentioning Khan's name on television and PTI protests were suppressed, while PTI supporters were arrested and harassed[91] by the military, judiciary as well other political parties.[113][13] The majority of the party leadership found themselves imprisoned or exiled, while PTI rallies were subjected to attacks and bombings, making campaigning virtually impossible as candidates were forced into hiding.[114] The Intercept reported allegations of military involvement in the killing and torture of PTI supporters, and also noted that Pakistani media was significantly restricted over the past year, making critical reporting on the army and government nearly impossible.[18]\n\nOn one occasion, Usman Dar, a former member of Imran Khan's cabinet, announced his resignation from the PTI and also withdrew from the election after police officials assaulted his elderly mother, Rehana Dar, in her own bedroom. Rehana Dar subsequently appeared on TV, announcing her intention to enter the election race and contest against Khawaja Asif. She expressed, \"You have achieved what you wanted by making my son [Usman Dar] step down at gunpoint, but my son has quit politics, not me. Now you will face me in politics\".[10]\n\nJust 48 hours before the voting, a full-page advertisement declaring Nawaz Sharif as the prime minister was published on the front pages of every newspaper in the country.[115]\n\nAppointment of bureaucrats as electoral officers\n\nFor the first time in Pakistan's electoral history since 1985, Chief Electoral Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja employed the services of the highly politicized[116] executive bureaucracy, particularly Assistant Commissioners and Deputy Commissioners, in the key electoral roles of Returning Officers (RO) and District Returning Officers (DRO).[117] These ROs and DROs are engaged in all stages of the electoral process: from screening applicants to consolidation of vote counts, and, finally, provisionally notifying winning candidates.[118] Traditionally, these posts have been occupied by the lower judiciary of the country.[119]\n\nOn 14 December 2023, Justice Ali Baqar Najafi of the Lahore High Court suspended the ECP's decision on the petition of the PTI that questioned the apparent bias of the appointed bureaucrats.[120] However, the next day, a three-member bench of the Supreme Court, consisting of Qazi Faez Isa, Mansoor Ali Shah, and Sardar Tariq Masood, set aside this ruling and allowed the DROs and ROs to be notified from the bureaucracy, meanwhile stopping LHC from undertaking further proceedings on the petition citing over-reach of authority.[121]\n\nOn 30 December 2023, these ROs rejected a majority of the nomination papers filed by the leadership of the PTI, including those of the party's chief, Imran Khan. The PTI's general secretary, Omar Ayub Khan, termed the rejections as \"pre-poll rigging\".[122] The party challenged these rejections in the courts.[123] Many of these rejections were later reversed by the courts.[124][125][126]\n\nCensorship\n\nOn 26 January 2024, PTI's official website, insaf.pk, and a separate website made for disseminating information regarding the individual electoral symbols of the party's candidates were blocked in Pakistan.[127] A voter helpline created by the party was also blocked.[128] Previously, social media was blocked in the country during the party's virtual electoral events on at least three separate occasions as per internet watchdog, NetBlocks.[129][130]\n\nJournalists covering the elections reported a 'near-blanket ban' on their ability to cover PTI candidates fairly. News channels allegedly received messages from individuals belonging to Pakistan's military establishment instructing them to remove all references to PTI in their visuals, graphics, and talking points.[131]\n\nElection day violence and disruptions\n\nWidespread internet disruption, with complete closure of mobile phone networks, was observed and condemned by Amnesty International as a blunt attack on the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly.[132] On 6 March, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) admitted in its response to the Sindh High Court (SHC) that the Ministry of Interior had indeed issued directives to suspend mobile phone services on the election day on 8 February, due to security concerns and fear of terror related activities.[133]\n\nSeveral polling stations faced instances of violence, ballot box snatching, vandalism and gunfire.[134][135][136]\n\nOn election day, polling stations were changed randomly, causing confusion and directing voters to incorrect polling locations.[114]\n\nElectoral system\n\nThe 336 members of the National Assembly consist of 266 general seats elected by first-past-the-post voting in single-member constituencies,[137] 60 seats that are reserved for women elected by proportional representation based on the number of general seats won by each party in each province, and ten seats that are reserved for non-Muslims elected through proportional representation based on the number of overall general seats won by each party. Independents cannot claim reserved seats.[138][139]\n\nThe government had passed a bill that required the next general elections to be held using EVMs (electronic voting machines). This was aimed at ending the allegations of rigging that have plagued previous elections in Pakistan. Still, the opposition's opinion was that it would make it extremely easy for PTI to rig the elections in their favour through security loopholes.[140]\n\nIn 2022 when the PTI-led government was ousted through a successful vote of no-confidence in the National Assembly, the 11 opposition parties, some of them being long-time rivals, formed a new government and passed the Elections Amendment Bill, which nullified the use of EVMs in the next general elections. Hence, EVMs were not used in the current general elections. Instead paper ballots were once again employed during the elections. Furthermore, overseas Pakistanis were also prevented from e-voting in these elections because of this amendment.[141]\n\nVoting and transmission of results\n\nRegistered voters in each polling station of an electoral district get two paper ballots to put a stamp on their preferred candidate for the national and provincial assembly respectively. These ballots are then counted by a presiding officer who then transmits the results for their polling station to the returning officer (RO) in Form 45. Copies of Form 45 are also given to the observing polling agents of the contesting candidates. The RO then consolidates these Form 45s, in front of the contesting candidates of the constituency they are overseeing, to give a provisional result in Form 47 before doing a final consolidation in Form 48. The ECP then uses the data from Forms 47 and 48 to officially notify elected members for each constituency using Form 49, provided that no candidate contested the unofficial consolidated counts given in Form 48.[142]\n\nTimeline\n\nIn July 2023 the ECP invited political parties to submit applications for the allocation of electoral symbols,[143] given that about 40% of the Pakistani population is illiterate.[144]\n\nAs of 25 July 2023, the total number of registered voters in Pakistan stood around 127 million as compared to 106 million (including 59.22 million men and 46.73 million women voters) in 2018, according to the data released by the ECP.[145] According to the figures, the number of eligible female voters stood at 58.5 million (around 46 per cent of the total registered voters) while the number of eligible male voters was 68.5 million (about 54 per cent of the total voters).[146]\n\nIn late September the ECP announced that citizens over 18 can update their voter details until 25 October 2023. The ECP decided to \"unfreeze\" the electoral rolls to allow registered voters to rectify or update their details.[147]\n\nOn 2 November 2023, President Arif Alvi and the ECP agreed on holding general elections on 8 February, after a meeting was held in Aiwan-i-Sadr on the orders of the Supreme Court. The court had instructed the ECP to consult with the President on the poll date.[148]\n\nOn 15 December 2023, the ECP issued the election schedule. It set 22 December as the last date for filing nomination papers.[149] On that day however, the ECP extended the deadline for the submission of nomination papers to 24 December.[150] More than 5,000 people were officially recognized as candidates for the 266 directly elected seats in the National Assembly, with only 313 of them being women.[144]\n\nCompared to the 46.89 percent female voter turnout in 2018, the share of female voters share decreased to 41.3 percent in 2024, while the male turnout increased from 56.01 percent to 58.7 percent.[151]\n\nAccording to data from the ECP, over 17,800 candidates contested the elections for national and provincial assemblies. Among them were 5,160 candidates, including 312 women and two transgender persons, who competed for 266 general seats of the National Assembly. The data revealed that the TLP, which debuted in the 2018 elections nominated more candidates than the country\u2019s two major parties \u2014 the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N). The PPP nominated 219 candidates, while the PML-N fielded 212 candidates.[152]\n\nParties\n\nThe table below lists each party that either received a share of the vote higher than 0.5% in the 2018 Pakistan general election or had representation in the 15th National Assembly of Pakistan. Political parties are ordered by their vote share in the 2018 elections. Independent candidates received 11.46% of the vote and 13 national assembly seats (both general seats and total seats in the 15th National Assembly, as reserved seats for women and minorities, are given to political parties) in 2018.[citation needed]\n\nOpinion polls\n\nIn August 2023, the ECP imposed a total ban on entrance and exit polls including those on official digital media accounts of electronic and print media outlets.[154] Before the ban, opinion polling in June 2023 by Gallup Pakistan, the Institute of Public Opinion Research (IPOR) and IRIS showed that the PML-N had regained its lead over the PTI especially in the country's largest province, Punjab.[citation needed]\n\nSecurity concerns and violence\n\nThe ECP categorised half the country's 90,675 polling stations as either \"sensitive\", meaning there is a risk of violence, or \"most sensitive\", indicating a higher risk. The classifications were based on the area's security situation and history of electoral violence.[155] In Balochistan Province alone, caretaker provincial home minister Muhammad Zubair Jamali said that almost 80% of its 5,028 polling stations had been declared \"sensitive\".[156]\n\nPre-poll violence\n\nOn 25 January 2024, the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan pledged not to stage attacks on election rallies and would limit itself to attacking military and police targets during the election period. This followed the government's decision to deploy troops in sensitive constituencies after intelligence agencies warned that militants could target rallies.[157]\n\nTwo candidates were killed during the election campaign. On 10 January, Malik Kaleem Ullah, an independent candidate for the Provincial Assembly of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, was shot dead while on a door-to-door sortie, while on 31 January, Rehan Zaib Khan, an independent candidate affiliated with the PTI, was killed after gunmen opened fire on his car in a market in Bajaur, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, in an attack that also injured three people and was claimed by the Islamic State \u2013 Khorasan Province (ISIS-K). On 30 January, four people were killed and five others injured in an explosion during a PTI rally in Sibi, Balochistan Province, while on 31 January, 15 people were injured in attacks on residences and offices of PPP candidates and the election office of the PML-N in Balochistan, which was partially claimed by the Baloch Liberation Army.[158] On 7 February, 29 people were killed in explosions outside an independent candidate's office and an office of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) (JUI-F) in Balochistan.[159] Both attacks were claimed by ISIS-K.[160]\n\nIncidents on election day\n\nThe Pakistan Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the closure of its borders with Iran and Afghanistan on the eve of the general elections on 8 February, as a measure to enhance security.[161][162]\n\nTen minutes before polling stations opened, the interior ministry announced the suspension of mobile internet services across the country, citing recent terrorist incidents.[144] NetBlocks director Alp Toker called the outage \"amongst the largest\" that they had observed. PPP leader Bilawal Bhutto Zardari demanded that the government restore services and said its lawyers would challenge the decision in court.[163] The PTI called the outage a \"cowardly act\".[111]\n\nIn Balochistan, grenades were thrown at two polling stations by unidentified individuals. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a soldier was killed in an attack by gunmen in Kot Azam,[164] while five security personnel were killed in an attack in Kulachi. A polling station in the same province was shelled by mortars. Two security officers were killed and nine wounded by an explosion near a polling station in Lajja, Balochistan, while two people were injured following 14 \"minor blasts\" in Gwadar.[105]\n\nPost-election violence\n\nOn 9 February, two PTI workers were killed and 24 others were injured after clashes broke out between police and PTI supporters demonstrating against alleged electoral fraud in Shangla District, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.[165] [166] On 10 February, Mohsin Dawar, the leader of the National Democratic Movement who was running for a national assembly seat in North Waziristan, was seriously injured in a gun attack in Miranshah.[167] On 11 February, six people, including a police officer, were killed and five others were injured in election-related clashes in Larkana.[168] On 12 February, Chaudhry Muhammad Adnan, a former PTI member of the Punjab Assembly and Independent candidate for the NA-57 Rawalpindi-VI and PP-19 Rawalpindi-XIII constituencies in Punjab, was shot dead in Rawalpindi.[169] On 13 February, three people were killed and five others were injured in a gun attack on a PPP victory rally in Dera Ismail Khan.[170] On 14 February, two people were killed and 13 others were injured in clashes between BAP and PPP supporters during a recount outside the office of the returning officer in Hub, Balochistan.[171]\n\nResults\n\nNational Assembly\n\nThe election was postponed in the NA-8 Bajaur constituency in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa due to the killing of candidate Rehan Zaib Khan. Provincial assembly elections were also postponed in the constituencies of PK-22 and PK-91 (both in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) due to the deaths of candidates there.[172]\n\nVote share of independents backed by Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf\n\nAllegations of rigging\n\nThe election saw delays in the reporting of results across thousands of polling stations, sparking controversy. Initial reports suggested PTI-backed candidates were leading,[10] but the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) refuted these claims.[173] Instances of alleged tampering emerged, including significant discrepancies in vote counts and unexpected shifts in results.[174][175][176] PTI officials accused the ECP of manipulation and initiated legal challenges.[177][178][179] Concerns grew as delays persisted, with accusations of internet shutdowns aimed at impeding opposition efforts.[180][112] PTI leaders contested official results, claiming widespread irregularities and fabrications, prompting legal action and calls for resignations within the ECP.[181][182] Revelations of electoral fraud surfaced, including admissions from officials implicated in rigging.[183] Despite retractions,[184] doubts lingered, leading to urgent calls for investigations by election monitoring groups like the Free and Fair Election Network (FAFEN).[185] The Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (PILDAT) underscored declining fairness in its independent evaluation of the election, advocating for a thorough investigation by the ECP to address systemic issues.[186]\n\nOn 17 February, Rawalpindi Division commissioner Liaquat Ali Chattha resigned from his post after admitting his role in electoral fraud in the locality where 11 out of a total of 13 national assembly seats were won by PML-N candidates.[183] He claimed his office helped candidates, who were trailing in the actual vote counts by approximately 70,000 votes per candidate, to secure victory using fake stamps.[187][188] He implicated Chief Electoral Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja and Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa in the scheme.[189][190][191][192] The ECP denied the allegations, saying that divisional commissioners had no direct role in the electoral process, and said it would launch an inquiry.[189][193] Isa rejected the commissioner's allegation, calling them \"baseless\".[194] The PTI also called for an investigation.[195] Following his announcement, Chattha surrendered to police, who sealed off his office as part of an investigation.[196] In addition to the PTI, PML-N senator also demanded the resignation of Sikandar Sultan Raja over the rigging allegations.[197]\n\nFollowing Chattha's statement, X (formerly Twitter) was subsequently blocked in Pakistan,[198][199][200] without explanation. President Alvi commented that the blocking of social media websites in Pakistan reflected a lack of intellectual capacity to manage criticism.[201] The government initially dismissed reports of Twitter being blocked, but a document presented to the court on 20 March revealed that the Ministry of Interior and intelligence agencies had ordered the suspension of the website on 17 February, following a statement of Chattha's alleging election rigging. After more than a month, the government acknowledged on 20 March that Twitter was blocked in Pakistan.[202][203][204]\n\nOn 22 February however, Chattha retracted his claims of election rigging and apologised to the ECP, saying that the PTI offered a strong position for making the allegations.[205][206][184] He also said that his mention of the Chief Justice of Pakistan was \u201ctaken to create mistrust in general public\u201d against Qazi Faiz Isa.[207]\n\nDisinformation\n\nRumors spread on social media claiming that international media outlets had reported the PTI winning over 150 seats. However, a fact-check conducted by iVerify found no evidence to support these claims.[208]\n\nThe official Twitter account of Imran Khan, the de facto leader of the PTI, was involved in disseminating false information by sharing a fabricated video purportedly showing post-election rigging.[209]\n\nExit polling\n\nGallup Pakistan's exit poll survey indicated that the PTI garnered significant support from educated youth, with 41 percent of its voters being high school-educated individuals aged 18 to 24 or older. Conversely, the PML-N and the PPP received more backing from illiterate and middle-pass voters. Among bachelor's and master's degree holders, 35% supported the PTI, 15% favored the PML-N, and 10% supported the PPP. Meanwhile, the PML-N secured 29% of votes from illiterate voters, compared to the PPP's 23% and the PTI's 21%. Among middle-pass voters, 31% voted for the PML-N, 26% for the PTI, and 15% for the PPP, as per the survey findings.[210]\n\nInternational analysis\n\nMedia outlets around the world denounced the election as \"fraudulent\"[18] with western media characterized the election as already decided, favoring the military-backed candidate Nawaz Sharif.[114]\n\nThe New York Times wrote the election results had caught many off guard, as the PML-N was widely anticipated to secure a landslide victory with the backing of the military. The report noted that voters expressed frustration with the military's interference in politics and opted to vote for PTI candidates in defiance of the military generals.[211] It went on to say the election results had humiliated the military establishment and started a new political crisis in the country.[212] Another article by the same newspaper said that the growing public discontent with military interference in politics is likely to pressure Pakistan's army chief General Asim Munir, with his only options being to reconcile with Imran Khan or push forward with an anti-Khan coalition, which many analysts believe would be weak and unsustainable.[213]\n\nThe Washington Post in its editorial board wrote following the election outcome, the military's control is being questioned more than ever before, possibly in decades as for the first time, the military-preferred candidate, Nawaz Sharif, was unable to win the most seats.[13] In a separate piece, it wrote that the youth of Pakistan caused the most significant election upset in the country's recent history saying that the youth is increasingly discontented with economic uncertainty and blame corruption and political dynasties. This dissatisfaction is now being expressed more openly on social media, potentially straining the relationship between civilian leaders and the military which will have long-lasting effects.[112] It also wrote that the election results were a humiliation for Sharif, despite being seen as the favoured candidate of the Pakistani military, which had held significant influence in determining the prime minister.[214]\n\nFrance 24 called the election \"The 'generals' elections' which turned against the military\". It also dubbed the election as the \"most rigged\" in the country's history saying the military was seen as backing Nawaz Sharif.[215] According to Time, the Pakistani military did everything to \"sideline Imran Khan\u2014and failed,\" but said that the military was continuing to try and prevent the PTI from returning to power[216] calling the election result as an embarrassment for Sharif.[217]\n\nRyan Grim in an article published by The Intercept wrote the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), was poised to manipulate the election outcome to ensure Nawaz Sharif's victory. However, they were overwhelmed by the unexpected surge of PTI support.[114] In a different piece, Grim wrote that the historic turnout in Pakistan was swamping the military's effort to rig the election and that the military has proved unable to suppress the populist movement interrogating its authority.[10] The Economist called the election \"botched\", but wrote that the military favours the \"shabby\" result, fearing that it would lose its economic benefits shout it give up power.[218] It also suggested that the despite their efforts, the military leadership did not seem to have as much control as they believed to prevent Khan from winning.[219] It also said the election outcome was a strong message to the military and could potentially mark a shift in its influence over Pakistani politics, while adding that a prolonged period of political instability could occur in the short-term. It called the electoral process \"dubious\" which was preceded by a coordinated campaign by the military against Imran Khan.[220]\n\nThe Guardian noted that suspicions of military rigging arose during election day due to a nationwide mobile phone blackout and the slow counting of results, leading to concerns that the military was exerting influence to secure the PML-N's success.[221] It added that the military's attempts to influence the election appeared to have been thwarted, particularly due to the PTI's effective utilization of social media, given the significant levels of illiteracy in the country.[222] In a separate article, The Guardian noted analysts' views that the election results and potential weak coalition government align with the military's interests, protecting their political and business agendas.[8]\n\nThe Financial Times in its editorial called the election results \"flawed\" and \"shocking\", at the same time describing it as a rejection of military influence.[113] Pakistani columnist Khurram Husain was quoted in a separate piece in the newspaper as saying that Pakistan will experience not only the influence of the military but also a collaborative endeavour involving the judiciary and major political parties to thwart the PTI from assuming power.[223]\n\nThe New York Post, referencing the New York Times article, stated that this election marks the initial instance in Pakistan's history where a party has achieved such success without the support of the military and this will spark a new political chaos in the country.[224] According to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation the election results did not unfold as per the military's expectations and had shaken the elite. Hasan Askari Rizvi was quoted as saying, \"This is a negative vote for the policies that the military was pursuing.\".[225]\n\nSameer Arshad Khatlani in an opinion piece for the Dhaka Tribune wrote \"Election results seem to be blowing up in the military establishment's face which attempted to make Imran Khan irrelevant by jailing him, cracking down PTI\".[226] Lipika Pelham wrote for the BBC saying despite PTI-backed independents winning the majority of seats in parliament, they were unlikely to be permitted to form a government.[227]\n\nDuring an interview with The Wire, Najam Sethi remarked that Imran Khan and the PTI had strongly resisted the influence of the military, which led to the latter resorting to last-minute rigging efforts.[228] Firstpost wrote that the Pakistani military had experienced a setback, at least temporarily, with public sentiment turning against it. It also noted that allegations of electoral fraud by the military put Western countries in a difficult position, given their historic support of the military to ensure the security of the country's nuclear arsenal.[229] It added that \"General Asim Munir's tenure may be remembered as one of the darkest for the army, with its reputation suffering greatly under his leadership.\" It also raised concern over Munir's post-election speech, describing it as uncommon.[230] The Times of India also described Munir as the primary loser of the election.[231] The Indian Express wrote that the unexpected success of the PTI forced the military to manipulate results to avoid an unfavourable outcome. Consequently, there were delays in announcing results, and internet and mobile services were suspended in numerous regions. Meanwhile, Pakistani social media platforms were flooded with videos depicting alleged rigging and manipulation.[232] The Deccan Herald wrote that although the election results represented a significant setback for the military, and would potentially undermine General Munir's position, but it was unlikely that the military will relinquish its influential role in determining the next prime minister.[233]\n\nAccording to Al Jazeera, numerous analysts suggest that Sharif's return to electoral politics was made possible due to the military's decision to support him in the election. However, despite this tacit support from the military, Sharif failed to win.[234]\n\nForeign Policy wrote that one clear thing is the old methods used to silence people's voices are no longer effective. A new generation of young voters has emerged in Pakistan who are calling for a departure from the past and seeking the ability to elect their leaders, rather than allowing the military, which has historically dominated politics to maintain control over the country.[91] In a separate piece, it wrote that one key factor in the PTI's success in the election was their refusal to let the military control the election's outcome, despite their efforts to ensure the PTI's defeat, and that the PTI's challenge to break the military's grip on politics, has sparked some hope for the future of Pakistan's democracy and wrote that accusations of military's vote manipulation will further fuel anti-establishment feelings in the country.[235]\n\nReruns\n\nThe ECP ordered elections to be held again on 15 February in twenty-six polling stations of the NA-88 Khushab-II constituency in Punjab after a mob destroyed election materials at the office of the returning officer. Due to security issues re-polling was ordered in six polling stations of NA-43 Tank-cum-Dera Ismail Khan constituency in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to be held on 17 February. Elections were also ordered repeated in the provincial assembly constituencies in PS-18 Ghotki-I in Sindh and PK-90 Kohat-I in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa after election materials were either stolen or destroyed.[236][237]\n\nInternational observers\n\nIn October 2023, the ECP issued invitations to foreign election observers, emphasizing transparency in the election process.[238] Before the elections, Pakistan received visa applications from 81 foreign journalists and 38 international observers. Visa applications were processed, and accreditation was made mandatory for foreign observers upon arrival in Pakistan.[239] Eligible applicants were in the process of being approved with visas.[240][241] The Pakistan High Commission in London issued visas to 37 British journalists, including prominent figures such as Christina Lamb of The Times, allowing them to cover the election proceedings in Pakistan.[242]\n\nA team from the Commonwealth, led by former Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, was sent to Pakistan to monitor the elections.[243] The Commonwealth Observer Group (COG), commended the ECP for its role in maintaining peace and smooth conduct during the elections.[244] Despite the recent suspension of mobile and internet services, the observers confirmed that the voting process in Pakistan remained uninterrupted.[245] Jonathan emphasized the importance of casting votes over internet services. The COG released its initial findings, acknowledging the efforts of the ECP and other institutions in organizing the general elections.[246]\n\nThe European Union (EU) did not send a full election observation mission as it had done in previous years. The European Union informed the Pakistani Government that it would not be able to deploy a full mission due to lack of time. Instead, a small team of experts visited Pakistan during the elections. Ambassador of the European Union in Pakistan Ms. Reena Kivinka said that various government officials have been informed about this decision. Despite the absence of a full EU observer group, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) maintained an open-door policy and welcomed an observation mission for the upcoming general elections. The small EU expert mission was still able to provide valuable insight into the electoral process.[247][248]\n\nAftermath\n\nProtests were held by the PTI and other parties in cities across Pakistan to protest alleged electoral fraud. Dozens were arrested following protests in Lahore while highways were blocked in Balochistan.[249] On 14 February, the JUI-F's leader Fazal-ur-Rehman said that he rejected the election results and announced that his party would stage protests against the ECP.[250] Awami National Party provincial president for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Aimal Wali Khan in a press conference rejected the results of the elections, claiming they were already decided before voting began. He admitted their past cooperation with the establishment was a mistake and vowed not to work with them anymore. He also accused the military of using the country's resources for their benefit.[251]\n\nOn 12 February, Jahangir Tareen and Pervez Khattak announced their decision to retire from politics entirely, while Siraj-ul-Haq resigned from his position as the emir of Jamaat-i-Islami.[252] Later, Khattak stepped down as the leader of the PTI-Parliamentarians[253] while Jamaat-e-Islami unanimously refused to accept Haq's resignation as its leader.[254]\n\nOn 16 February, the PTI held a press conference where they labelled the election as the \"largest voter fraud\" in Pakistan's history, targeting the party and its candidates. They asserted that 85 seats had been unfairly taken away from them.[255][256]\n\nThe party announced plans for nationwide protests on 17 February to denounce widespread electoral rigging.[257] On the same day, PTI-affiliated candidate Salman Akram Raja was arrested in Lahore while participating in a protest.[258]\n\nDuring the first Senate session after the election, there were widespread calls by members for an inquiry into the election process, with senators from the JI and the PTI urging legal action against the chief election commissioner.[259]\n\nFormation of a new federal government\n\nOn 10 February, in an AI-generated victory speech from prison, Imran Khan claimed that based on completed forms provided by polling agents, his party had won a two-thirds majority.[260][261] On 13 February, the PTI announced that it would try and form a government through its affiliated independent candidates in the national level and in Punjab with the Majlis Wahdat-e-Muslimeen (MWM) party. It also said that it would seek to form a coalition with the Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan (JI) party to lead a government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Khan had previously said that he would not engage with the PML-N's Nawaz Sharif and the PPP's Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, calling them \"corrupt\".[262] On 14 February, the JI rejected the proposed coalition with the PTI in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, citing a change in the latter's stance over the formation of the provincial government, as the PTI only offered a coalition at the provincial level, not nationally.[263][264]\n\nNawaz Sharif, whose party won a plurality of seats in parliament, said that he would seek to build a governing coalition with the PPP.[265] Since the election, at least six winning independent candidates to the National Assembly have announced that they would be joining the PML-N, including PTI-affiliated candidate Waseem Qadir, who was previously a PML-N member until 2018.[266] He alleged he was abducted and therefore he re-joined PML-N, but skeptics suggested he was bribed.[18]\n\nAfter the election results, both Nawaz Sharif and Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, who were contenders for the prime minister's position, withdrew from the race.[267] On 13 February, at a press conference at the residence of the Pakistan Muslim League (Q)'s Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain in Islamabad, the PML-N's Shehbaz Sharif, the PPP's Asif Ali Zardari, Muttahida Qaumi Movement \u2013 Pakistan's Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, Balochistan Awami Party's Sadiq Sanjrani and Istehkam-e-Pakistan Party's Aleem Khan announced that their parties had agreed to form a coalition government.[23] PML-N spokesperson Marriyum Aurangzeb said that Shehbaz was the prime ministerial nominee following his elder brother Nawaz's recommendation.[22] PPP leader Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said that he would endorse a PML-N nominee for prime minister and that the PPP would not join the next cabinet. He also expressed a desire to see his father Asif Ali Zardari return as president, and said that his party would field nominees for the chairmanship of the Pakistani Senate and the speakership of the National Assembly.[262] A senior PPP leader was quoted as saying that the party preferred to have a minimal role in the coalition government saying that \"We don't want to take that heavy responsibility.\"[268] Analysts suggest that this arrangement seemed to enjoy the backing of the military.[268] JUI-F chief Fazal-ur-Rehman, a long-time ally of the PML-N, declined to support the PML-N and instead suggested that the PML-N should sit on the opposition benches.[267] The coalition agreement between the PML-N and the PPP was finalized on 20 February, with Shahbaz Sharif as prime minister and Asif Ali Zardari as president.[269][270] Media termed this coalition as \"PDM 2.0\" in reference to the previous coalition led by PML-N and PPP following Imran Khan's removal as prime minister.[271] Khurshid Shah revealed that the PPP initially approached the PTI instead of the PML-N to explore possibilities in forming a government but was turned down by the PTI.[272][273]\n\nOnly three weeks before the election, Bhutto Zardari had criticized the PML-N saying their \"policies had hurt the country's economy,\" and remarked \"Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me\", when asked about the possibility of entering into a coalition with the PML-N.[274] In response, Imran Khan called the upcoming coalition a \"daylight robbery\" and warned \"against the misadventure of forming a government with stolen votes.\"[275] Akhtar Mengal, the president of the Balochistan National Party (Mengal), said that the PML-N and PPP-led coalition would collapse within one and a half years due to the parties \"blackmailing\" each other, citing previous coalition governments.[276] Observers noted that the increased support for the PTI had changed the power dynamics, making a Sharif-led government seem weak even before it began.[268] A PML-N leader, speaking anonymously, acknowledged that the party might not complete its full five-year term if it forms a government and stated that the party's entire election campaign centred around Nawaz Sharif becoming the prime minister, which resulted in feelings of betrayal and disappointment among supporters when Nawaz chose to nominate Shehbaz for the position instead.[277] JUI-F chief Fazal-ur-Rehman also reiterated his belief that the incoming coalition government is unlikely to complete its full five-year tenure.[278] He further cautioned about the risk of a \"system collapse\" in the country due to excessive interference from the establishment and added that the establishment aimed to ensure that people aligned with their preferences were elected to the assemblies.[279]\n\nOn 27 February, a leaked video surfaced showing MQM-P leader Syed Mustafa Kamal, where he was shown saying during an MQM-P party meeting that PML-N leaders informed him about the PPP's claim that the \"MQM-P's mandate is 100% fake\". Kamal later confirmed the authenticity of this video.[280][281][282] Later on the same day, Sindh Governor and MQM-P leader Kamran Tessori also acknowledged in another leaked audio recording that the MQM-P \"did not get votes in this election,\" and emphasized the difference from the 2018 general election when MQM-P obtained seven seats, which was their actual vote bank.[283]\n\nOn 16 February, senior PTI official Asad Qaiser said that Imran Khan had nominated Omar Ayub Khan, a grandson of former military ruler Muhammad Ayub Khan, as the PTI's nominee for prime minister, despite him being in hiding over charges relating to the May 9 riots.[284] The PTI also nominated Mian Aslam Iqbal and Ali Amin Gandapur as its respective nominees for chief minister in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.[285] Later that day however, PTI official Muhammad Ali Saif stated that the party had chosen to be in the opposition both at the federal level and in Punjab, following the directives of Imran Khan.[286]\n\nOn 19 February, the PTI announced that it would form an alliance with the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) solely to secure its portion of reserved seats in the National, Punjab, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa assemblies.[287][288] Following the announcement, nearly all PTI-backed independent candidates in national and provincial assemblies submitted affidavits to the ECP, officially joining the SIC[289] and approached the ECP to claim their reserved seats. However, the PPP, the PML-N, and the MQM-P challenged the allocation of reserved seats to the PTI/SIC bloc, arguing that the latter did not qualify as a \"parliamentary party\". PTI chair Gohar Ali also emphasized that an NA session could not be called without first notifying the reserved seats for the PTI-backed SIC bloc.[290] The ECP withheld the allocation of 78 out of the total 226 reserved seats for women and minorities in the national and four provincial assemblies. By 26 February, these 78 reserved seats were pending allocation to the PTI/SIC, awaiting the ECP's decision.[291]\n\nInauguration of the National Assembly\n\nPresident Arif Alvi declined to convene the National Assembly's inaugural session, which is typically summoned within 21 days of the general elections as per the constitution. He was also of the view that Assembly was not complete and therefore the ECP should distribute the reserved seats for women and minorities to the PTI-backed SIC bloc. As a result, he faced significant criticism from the PPP and the PML-N[292][293] who asserted that the President's action amounts to \"abrogating the Constitution\" by not convening the session, and warned of potential legal consequences.[294] Imran Khan also endorsed Alvi's decision to decline the summoning of the session and said that they were drafting a letter to the International Monetary Fund (IMF),[295] urging for the condition that any of its discussions with the incoming PML-N/PPP coalition government should be contingent upon an independent audit of the general election.[296] This action was heavily criticized by the PML-N and the PPP, who argued that sending such a letter would be tantamount to inviting foreign intervention in the country's domestic affairs.[297] On 28 February, the National Assembly Secretariat scheduled the inaugural session for 29 February at 10 a.m., bypassing the need for notification from Alvi.[298] At the very last moment, Alvi relented and approved a summary for calling the inaugural session late at night, albeit with reservations about the tone of the summary from caretaker prime minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar.[299]\n\nOn 29 February, a total of 302 newly elected legislators took their oaths, marking the commencement of the 16th National Assembly. The maiden session, however, was disrupted by chaos and slogans in favour of Imran Khan. This was the first time where PTI MNAs were able (due to parliamentary privilege) to chant Imran Khan's name and display his photos on live TV since a ban was imposed on mentioning his name on television. The PTI's nominee for the premiership, Omar Ayub Khan, along with PTI chair Gohar Ali Khan, emphasized during their addresses to the session that the Assembly remained incomplete as MNAs nominated for reserved seats were unable to attend the session and take the oath.[300][301] On 4 March, a five-member bench of the ECP, chaired by CEC Sikandar Sultan Raja, delivered a much-awaited 4-1 verdict to dismiss the plea from the PTI/SIC for reserved seats in the National Assembly. The ruling stated that the bloc is not eligible for reserved seats and asserted that leaving reserved seats vacant is not permissible, and thus these seats would be allocated to other political parties based on their proportional representation. However, the ECP Punjab member disagreed from the majority decision.[302] PTI leaders criticised the verdict and vowed to contest the ECP's ruling in court[303] while several lawyers and activists also criticized the ECP for its decision.[304] Speaking to the media from jail, Imran Khan also criticized the denial of reserved seats to the PTI as unconstitutional, drawing parallels to the disenfranchisement of East Pakistan following the 1970 Pakistani general election which ultimately resulted in the country's disintegration.[305] On 8 March, several members of the provincial and national assemblies who were allocated reserved seats, which were denied tp the PTI/SIC, took their oaths in respective assemblies. This occurred despite PHC injunctions and notices to the ECP instructing lawmakers not to take their oaths.[306] On 14 March, the Peshawar High Court dismissed the PTI/SIC petition challenging the ECP's decision to reject the party's allocation of reserved women and minority seats.[307] After which some PTI party leaders made controversial statements attributing PTI's loss of reserved seats in the parliament to its decision to enter into an alliance with the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC).[308]\n\nAfter the allocation of reserved seats, excluding the PTI/SIC bloc, to other political parties, the PML-N emerged as the largest party in the National Assembly, gaining 16 seats to reach 123, while the PPP's count increased to 73 and the JUI-F's to 11. On 6 March, the ECP uploaded Forms 45, 46, 48, and 49 on its website about a month post the election, thereby violating the legal requirement for their release within 14 days after the polls.[309] In a press conference, the PTI leaders including Gohar Ali Khan described the Forms 45 released by the ECP on its website as \"heavily tampered\", resulting in the outcomes favoring PTI's opponent candidates. They also asserted possession of \"original and signed Form-45s,\" alleging significant \"fraud\" in the compilation of election results.[310][311] The PTI declared their intention to approach the Supreme Court regarding the purported alteration of Form-45s and called for a comprehensive and independent audit of the election outcomes.[312]\n\nOn 10 March, the PTI/SIC officially nominated Omar Ayub Khan as the leader of the opposition in the National Assembly.[313]\n\nElection of the Prime Minister\n\nOn 2 March, Shehbaz Sharif of the PML-N and PTI-backed independent candidate Omar Ayub Khan submitted their nomination papers for the prime ministerial elections.[314] The next day on 3 March, Shehbaz was re-elected as Prime Minister of Pakistan for the second time, securing 201 votes against the 92 votes received by Omar Ayub Khan. Due to the absence of a clear majority for any single party in the assembly, Shehbaz was elected with the joint support from PML-N's allies such as the PPP, MQM-P, PML-Q, BAP, PML-Z, IPP, NP among others.[315][24][316] He would soon afterwards be officially sworn in.[317] During the session, PTI-backed SIC MNAs chanted slogans alleging that Shehbaz came to power through rigging[318] with Omar Ayub terming the Shahbaz' PM election as 'illegal'. Omar Ayub Khan also condemned censorship in his speech after the state-run Pakistan Television Corporation was reported to have abruptly ceased live broadcasting as soon as he had started to speak, comparing it with live coverage of Shehbaz's statements.[319][320]\n\nThe cabinet of Shehbaz Sharif was formally sworn in by President Asif Ali Zardari on 11 March.[321]\n\nElection of the President\n\nThe coalition agreement which was reached also called for Asif Ali Zardari to return as President of Pakistan.[317] On 3 March, the police conducted a raid on Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PKMAP) leader Mahmood Khan Achakzai who was also a presidential candidate in the 2024 Pakistani presidential election contesting against PPP leader Asif Ali Zardari. The PKMAP claimed that the raid was a reaction following a speech delivered by Achakzai in the National Assembly[322] where he criticized the \"establishment\" for their interference in the polls.[323][324] On 8 March, Achakzai, in a letter to the ECP requested the postponement of the presidential elections, citing concerns that holding elections without reserved seats in the assemblies would be unconstitutional. However, the ECP dismissed Achakzai's request.[325]\n\nOn 9 March, Zardari secured his second term as President of Pakistan with the backing of the PML-N and rest of the ruling coalition in a vote held by the national and provincial assemblies. Zardari received 411 votes, while Achakzai received 181 votes.[326] The PTI denounced the vote as \"illegal,\" asserting that the election of the \"king of corruption,\" referring to Zardari, was forced upon the nation.[327]\n\nFormation of provincial governments\n\nOn 23 February 2024, the 18th Punjab Assembly convened approximately 313 newly elected MPAs were sworn in. This included 193 from the PML-N, 98 PTI-backed independents, 13 from the PPP, 10 from the PML-Q, five from the IPP, and one each from the TLP and the PML-Z.[328] On 26 February, Nawaz Sharif's daughter, Maryam Nawaz, was elected as the first female chief minister of Punjab with 220 votes in the assembly,[329] while her opponent PTI-backed candidate Rana Aftab Ahmad Khan boycotted the elections.[330] The next day, the PTI announced that it would convene a separate Punjab Assembly session to select its chief minister, speaker, and deputy speaker, asserting a majority with 250 MPAs, including those from reserved seats for women and minorities. They labeled the election of Maryam Nawaz to the chief ministership \"a stolen mandate\" and asserted that she was defeated on her provincial assembly seat from PP-159 Lahore-XV by a PTI-backed candidate, Mehr Sharafat.[331]\n\nOn 24 February, 147 MPAs of the 16th Sindh Assembly took their oath of office,[332] of which 84 MPAs from the PPP, 28 from the MQM-P, 14 independents, including those backed by the PTI, and two each from the GDA and JI.[333] On 26 February, PPP leader Syed Murad Ali Shah was re-elected as the Sindh Chief Minister for a third consecutive term, receiving 112 votes. His opponent, Ali Khursheedi of the MQM-P, garnered 36 votes.[334]\n\nOn 28 February, the 12th Provincial Assembly of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa convened as more than 115 newly elected MPAs were sworn in. Among those sworn in were 87 PTI-backed SIC lawmakers, nine from the JUI-F, eight from the PML-N, five from the PPP, two from the PTI-Parliamentarians, and four independents.[335] The next day, Ali Amin Gandapur, a PTI backed independent candidate was elected as the Chief Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, securing 90 votes. His opponent, Ibadullah Khan of the PML-N, received 16 votes.[336]\n\nOn 28 February, 57 newly elected MPAs of the 12th Baloch Assembly were sworn in where the PPP and the PML-N emerged as the two largest parties.[337] On March 2, Sarfraz Bugti was elected unopposed as the new Chief Minister of Balochistan with the joint support of the PPP and the PML-N.[338]\n\nReactions\n\nDomestic\n\nAfter polling closed, caretaker Prime Minister Anwaar ul Haq Kakar said that the elections were a \"momentous occasion\". He praised the enthusiasm of the people of Pakistan and expressed appreciation for their participation in the polling process, adding that \"the high voter turnout is a clear indication of public commitment to shaping the future of our country.\"[339]\n\nChief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja thanked the nation for the successful election and expressed gratitude to all stakeholders, including government bodies, security agencies, media, and voters. He urged returning officers to ensure timely results delivery.[340] The Pakistan Armed Forces, through its media wing ISPR, extended congratulations to the nation for the peaceful conduct of the general elections, emphasizing their role in advancing democracy and fulfilling the aspirations of the people.[341] Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Asim Munir urged citizens to move on from the politics of \"anarchy and polarization\", adding that a stable hand was needed to unite \"Pakistan's diverse polity\", and to make \"democracy functional and purposeful\".[342] During the first Corps Commanders\u2019 Conference held at the Pakistani military headquarters following the election and chaired by Asim Munir, the military rejected claims of election interference.[343]\n\nPresident Arif Alvi, stated that the use of electronic voting machines (EVMs) could have averted the uncertainty surrounding the election results and reminded of his efforts to introduce them in the country's electoral process.[344]\n\nIn a message from jail, Imran Khan claimed that the PTI won 170 seats, achieving a two-thirds majority in the 2024 elections.[345] He emphasized the power of the electorate and called for the protection of their votes.[345] According to Khan's sister, Aleema Khan, he described the rigging as the \"Mother of all rigging\" and ridiculed the PML-N, saying \"Instead of honouring the vote, the 'selected ones' have honoured the boot,\" implying that the PML-N prioritized military influence over respecting the electoral process.[346]\n\nThe Pakistan Foreign Ministry in a statement expressed surprise at international criticism regarding the elections, citing the complexity of the electoral process and the strong participation of millions of voters.[347][348]\n\nThe day after the election, the Pakistan Stock Exchange shed 2,200 points on opening, or 3.6% of its value, as delayed results and prospects of a hung parliament loomed.[349]\n\nDawn in its editorial titled \"Respect the mandate\" stated it is becoming increasingly clear that there is widespread anger and resentment towards the military's continuous involvement in civilian affairs, and urged the armed forces to abandon its grudge against the PTI. It added that \"though the public's decision was quite evident, some quarters still attempted to stamp their will over the election results.\" It also noted that \"the state must realise that, sometimes, a vote for the underdog is a vote against the establishment\".[350] Dawn referred to the largest number of independent candidates winning in a party-based election as a significant development in Pakistan's electoral history, describing it as a \"seismic shift\" and a clear message from the public that sidelining PTI and depriving them of their election symbol would not alter the election's trajectory.[351]\n\nThe Express Tribune in its editorial stated \"the fact that the people of Pakistan have made a choice, and have voted for parliamentary democracy must come as a soothing consolation.\"[352] Hamid Mir stated that PML-N supporters claimed to have received more votes on the day after the election.[353]\n\nHina Jilani, co-founder of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, expressed her astonishment at the election outcome, stating that she, like everyone else, was taken aback, saying that \"It's strange for me to say this, but I don't think the Pakistani public has ever played a strong role in enforcing democracy in this country.\" and that \"we have not seen a public uprising against the military takeover of political space in this country.\"[354]\n\nThe day after the election concluded, several notable Pakistani journalists, which include Syed Talat Hussain, Meher Bukhari, and Hamid Mir, took to Twitter to openly criticize the ECP, labeling its performance as a 'farcical failure' due to its inability to efficiently deliver election results.[355]\n\nInternational\n\nFollowing the election, Pakistan's classification in the Democracy Index was revised downward by the Economist Intelligence Unit, shifting it from a hybrid regime to an authoritarian regime.[363]\n\nOn 27 February, Moody's retained Pakistan's ratings at 'Caa3' with a stable outlook. Nevertheless, the agency emphasized significantly high risks of liquidity and external vulnerability challenges, terming the election \"controversial.\" The agency suggested that this situation could severely limit the decision-making capacity of the incoming coalition government.[364] Earlier in February 2023, Moody's downgraded Pakistan's rating from Caa1 to Caa3.[365]\n\nOn 28 February, at least 31 members of the United States Congress wrote a letter to US President Joe Biden, urging him to withhold recognition of the incoming coalition government until a \"thorough, transparent, and credible\" audit of the election is conducted. The letter also demanded that the United States cease military and other cooperation with Pakistan.[366][18] Among those critical of the results was Congressman Ro Khanna who also alleged that the Pakistani military was backing Nawaz Sharif.[367] In an interview, Congressman Greg Casar expressed concerns about American hypocrisy regarding Pakistani democracy, stating that he has directly contacted the State Department about it. He also warned Pakistan's Ambassador to the United States that existing laws could be utilized to reduce aid to Pakistan due to its human rights abuses.[368]\n\nOn 8 March, in an unusual political statement, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) urged Pakistani authorities to resolve all electoral disputes fairly and peacefully.[369]\n\nOn 20 March, a Congressional hearing titled \"Pakistan After the Elections: Examining the Future of Democracy in Pakistan and the US-Pakistan Relationship\" took place, during which Donald Lu provided testimony before a subcommittee of the US House Committee on Foreign Affairs.[370] Lu stated that the term \"free and fair\" was never used to describe the 2024 Pakistani elections and recommended that the ECP investigate allegations of election fraud. Additionally, he warned that if the ECP fails to address these allegations, it could negatively impact America's relationship with Pakistan.[371]\n\nSee also\n\nNotes",

On this day, millions of Americans will be casting their ballots with their selected candidates. While the act of voting itself is not a complicated process, as long as you are registered to vote in the state of Illinois, its significance is still an integral part of how the country is going to be governed.\n\nRibhi Salhi is a political science professor at the College of Lake County (CLC) who specializes in topics such as politics in the Middle East and Southeast Asia, American national politics, and comparative politics.\n\n\u201cThe word \u201cvoting\u201d comes from the word \u201cfranchise,\u201d\u2019 he said. \u201cIt means the right to vote and the right to express your thoughts in an electoral democratic process.\u201d\n\nSalhi went on to explain that throughout history, voting has become universal suffrage. This means that each citizen is eligible and must have the opportunity to vote. This process first began in the Greek city state of Athens, with its respective elections and voting systems.\n\nIf one is to go down even deeper in the field of political science, one will find that most experts and political scientists, who discuss the roads of democracy, emphasize the role of motive.\n\n\u201cOne of them, for example, Robert Dahl, has a list of minimum democracy that says that the right to vote means that people must be given the opportunity to select a number of candidates to ensure that the government in the future will be their agent and will represent their demands and their needs,\u201d he said. \u201cThe role of government is to serve you.\u201d\n\nIn the case of the United States of America, the country\u2019s own journey of democracy went through many interesting events. Voting did not have the aspect of universality as it is often associated with today, as certain demographics, such as women and African Americans, were not given the right to.\n\n\u201cThis was considered a Whig democracy,\u201d Salhi said.\n\nSalhi emphasized that if one were to go throughout the history of the United States and the constitution, it eventually included them, such as the Fifteenth Amendment, which is the right to vote and to protect the rights of African Americans under the environment of slavery. Meanwhile, the Nineteenth Amendment came out in 1920, which gave women the right to vote as well.\n\nHe also pointed out that when American women were allowed to vote in 1920, women in the United Kingdom were given the same right in 1928.\n\n\u201cThat was kind of like inspiration for other feminist movements elsewhere in the world.\u201d Salhi said.\n\nBy 1971 and 1972, the United States adapted the Twenty-sixth Amendment, which allowed for both sexes, once they were eighteen years of age, to become eligible to vote.\n\nThere is also the on-going debate of whether or not an incarcerated person should be allowed to vote. The topic remains a heated discussion to this day as both sides share their perspectives. Salhi explained that this is because there has been a conflict of ideas between the conservatives and the liberals and the advocate and the non-advocate.\n\n\u201cSome people will argue that if a person takes another\u2019s life, they should not have the right to vote,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you could argue otherwise that they have the right to practice any religion, the right to go back to school, to eat, [to] smoke, and even make a phone call. So, why not give them the right to vote?\u201d\n\nFurthermore, he added that the reserved powers and the tenth amendment of the U.S. Constitution are part of the powers of the states.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the states have the right to create their own set of rules for the electoral laws and policies,\u201d Salhi said. \u201cThat\u2019s why some states ask you to register, while others don\u2019t. That\u2019s why some states enjoy and practice open primaries or closed primaries.\u201d\n\nVoting also correlates with American democracy due to the existence of Whig democracy, a specific type that only allows the wealthy to have political participation. Eventually, there was another wave called common democracy that formed around U.S. President Andrew Jackson, which spanned from generation to generation.\n\n\u201cWe start to find American democracy hits another wave of struggle and beliefs, which we call advanced democracy.\u201d\n\nSalhi cited examples of this type with giving women the right to vote in the early 20th century, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, bilingual voting, which allowed voters to cast their ballots in their preferred language if they did not speak English, the media forces giving out information about the candidates, and the experts who explain the policy proposals.\n\n\u201cIn democracy, people create government, and government becomes [the] agent of their demands, and that\u2019s what leads the people to practice and to have the notion of oversight,\u201d Salhi said. \u201cIt empowers the rights of the people through popular sovereignty.\u201d\n\nSome of the basic things that people should know about voting are that it is associated with the following categories, which are divided by most political scientists: social and demographic characteristics, the surrounding political environment, and state electoral laws.\n\nSalhi stated a few instances of the first category, such as the Latino American demographic, who, despite some of them being undocumented, would be able to make a difference. Those who are living in rural areas and nursing homes might not feel motivated nor have the capability to go out and vote.\n\n\u201cWe have to have some mobility for all those people to enjoy this right,\u201d Salhi said.\n\nIn the second category, he pointed out that some people will not vote unless there is a controversial topic that has occurred in recent years, which influences the outcome of the election all the time.\n\n\u201cWe have the war in the Middle East, the war in Ukraine, the rise of China, and the two rival candidates, President Biden and former President Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that is going to drive people to vote for third-party candidates or go into the mindset that their vote does not count because the electoral college is the last resort to determining the presidency.\u201d\n\nSalhi added that one should keep in mind each respective state\u2019s electoral laws, which may present certain challenges for people.\n\nHe also stressed that the importance of voting has something to do with liberal democracy as it influences the election by voting for your preferred candidates and leads to the notion of political efficacy, which is achieved in one way by voting for the candidate that you think is going to meet your expectations, as the public has the ability to influence government and it is a mark of national pride.\n\n\u201cBecause that\u2019s your voice in democracy, and that\u2019s what makes the difference,\u201d he said.\n\nThe importance of voting is a sign of democracy and is used to practice one\u2019s constitutional rights, ensure a limited government that is under the control of the rules stated in the Constitution, and accept oversight.\n\n\u201cIt is given to you, as a citizen, for you to engage,\u201d Salhi said. \u201cAnd to keep your eyes on the government.\u201d\n\nVoting is still important to society in the 21st century because of its historic standing. By the end of the 1900s, the world experienced the end of communist rule in the Soviet Union and its eventual collapse, the steady rise of globalization, and the movement towards democratization.\n\nIn connection to this, Salhi shared that there are three waves of democracy that were identified by Samuel Huntington, a renowned American political scientist. The first wave was during the American Revolution, the British Glorious Revolution, and the French Revolution that occurred in the 1800s. The second wave was at the end of the Second World War, when the Axis Powers were pushed to become liberal democratic societies. Finally, the third wave occurred during the end of the Cold War and the disintegration of the Soviet Union.\n\n\u201cThese events, the changes, and the shift from authoritarianism to democracy\u2014we call it democratization,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what it means for the people to have the right to vote.\u201d\n\nBut Salhi also added that authoritarian systems, although they allow their respective citizens to vote, don\u2019t vote for political competitors. Instead, they are merely voting for a person who has already been decided. Many political scientists often label it a \u201cfake democracy\u201d if a nation allows the practice of voting but offers no limitations in governance.\n\n\u201cIn healthy and limited democracies, political competition is going to be there, and therefore, the interest in voting will increase,\u201d Salhi said. \u201cPolitical competition doesn\u2019t take place unless there is polarity in political candidates who represent all kinds of ideologies, like in third parties or in multiple parties in the system.\u201d\n\nThe biggest challenge in this scenario, according to Salhi, is to be educated and make up one\u2019s mind on which candidate to vote for.\n\nWhile some would still want to cast their vote, there will also be some who believe that their vote \u201cdoesn\u2019t matter\u201d and often do not participate. But how does one convince them to?\n\n\u201cThere are good tools to encourage people to vote,\u201d Salhi answered. \u201cOne of them is political mobilization, which is able to take on so many forms.\u201d\n\nHe cited a number of different scenarios where this could potentially take place.\n\n\u201cOne of them could be an influential speaker in a social gathering, which can be seen during election season; social media [can be one] because it has all kinds of platforms,\u201d he said. \u201cA community gathering could also be used, or even the new generations can explore more with this newfound technology we have.\u201d\n\nAside from that, Salhi also said that the influences on voters\u2019 behavior come from party identification, candidates\u2019 characteristics, and the issue of policy proposals.\n\n\u201cIf voters do not understand these three areas, they will experience several misconceptions,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile democracy is synonymous with the global conception of the United States, it does not appear anywhere in the constitution.\n\n\u201cThe framers did not use it,\u201d Salhi explained. \u201cWe have a republic; it means to have the rule of law, which is created by our representatives, who come into this office because of our vote.\u201d\n\nIn comparison to other nations around the world, which have many different political systems from one another and have their own flaws and shortcomings, there is no such thing as a perfect system.\n\n\u201cWe are human,\u201d Salhi said. \u201cWe make mistakes.\u201d\n\nHe argued that having a democracy is much better than having an authoritarian system that has oppressive elements attached to it. He emphasized that, despite its imperfections, the people have the principles of democratic institutions, the methods of government, and the roles for someone to run, which are much more ideal than having nothing.\n\nIn terms of the importance of the 2024 U.S. presidential elections, Salhi expressed that its importance is not just viewed domestically but internationally as well due to the country\u2019s reputation as a global superpower. As a result, any move that the U.S. could make can potentially have an impact around the world.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. is a major player in the global system,\u201d Salhi explained. \u201c[As a result], the U.S. presidential elections are deeply involved with foreign affairs such as the war in Ukraine, in the Middle East, and with its potential trade competitions in China.\u201d\n\nHe further explained that due to its status as a global leader for liberalism, human rights, and democracy, this has created more attention and more tension towards the United States.\n\nIn addition, the United States was able to maintain its position because it combined the two schools of thought, realism and idealism, and molded them into one in the concept of a \u201cgrand strategy,\u201d which allowed it to enhance its vital interests.\n\nDue to the rise of globalization and an increase of digital interconnectivity, Salhi also stated that in today\u2019s world, being aware of what is going on in politics isn\u2019t difficult to do.\n\n\u201cThe media is offering great sources to learn from and to be educated about,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also encouraged people who are bilingual and multilingual to find more sources in the languages that they understand.\n\n\u201cYou can have two sources of knowledge,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you can branch out that knowledge.\u201d\n\nHe shared his own experiences and said that he practices this in his spare time and is able to gather all of the data from the sources he has read about, filter them out, and go on from there.\n\nLastly, when asked what he wanted to say to the CLC community, he said that \u201cwe have the leaders of a better tomorrow.\u201d\n\nIf you want more information on how to register to vote and other related resources and topics, here is the link to the website of the Illinois State Board of Elections.

The deepfake Lake is made to reveal she is a deepfake. The creators write: \"Welcome to the terrifying new age of artificial intelligence deepfakes. It\u2019s only beginning. The 2024 election is going to be the first in history where any idiot with a computer can create convincing videos depicting fake events of global importance and publish them to the world in a matter of minutes. Including us.\"\n\n\n\nanalysis: The content is clearly labeled as AI generated.\n\n\n\nfact check: Arizona Agenda\n\nBiden on Kyiv\n\nMarch 22, 2024 | manipulated video\n\n\n\ncontent: Posted on twitter.com by an account with a track record of spreading disinformation, this video purports to show President Biden erroneously saying Russia has occupied Kyiv for 10 years (Russia invidated Crimea in 2014, not Kyiv).\n\n\n\nanalysis: Our analysis of the audio using a model trained to distinguish real from AI-generated speech confidently classifies the audio as AI-generated. Our analysis of the video with a second model trained to detect inconsistencies between the mouth movement and spoken words also reveals evidence that this video is a lip-sync deepfake in which President Biden's mouth has been synthesized to be consistent with the AI-generated voice.\n\n\n\nfact check: AFP\n\nTrump and Black Voters\n\nMarch 4, 2024 | manipulated image\n\n\n\ncontent: In a repeat of the February 1, 2024 entry below, a new batch of fake photos purportedly showing Donald Trump with Black voters continue to circulate on social media in, it would seem, an attempt to court Black voters.\n\n\n\nanalysis: Our analysis has detected patterns in this image that are consistent with the generative-AI service Midjourney. In addition, it has been reported by the BBC that one photo was created by the Florida-based conservative radio show host Mark Kaye. \u201cI'm not out there taking pictures of what\u2019s really happening. I\u2019m a storyteller,\u201d Kaye told BBC. \u201cI\u2019m not claiming it is accurate. I\u2019m not saying, \u2018Hey, look, Donald Trump was at this party with all of these African American voters. Look how much they love him.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nfact check: BBC\n\nFred Trump\n\nFebruary 18, 2024 | manipulated video\n\n\n\ncontent: On the heals of Donald Trump accusing some in the media of using AI to create unflattering footage of him, the Lincoln Project (a centrist PAC), released an AI-generated video of Trump's father, Fred Trump saying things like \"Everyone knows why the women leave you, you're boring, broke, and I told you not to get fat. You pay porn stars and you are weak down there. Your kids hate you, especially the girl. How did a son of mine turn out so damn dumb? The brand I built is crap because of you. You're trash. You'll be lucky to stay out of jail.\"\n\n\n\nanalysis: The video contains the disclosure \"This video has been manipulated by technical means and depicts speech or conduct that did not occur.\"\n\n\n\nfact check: Futurism\n\nTrump's Bloody Hand\n\nFebruary 1, 2024 | photo in question\n\n\n\ncontent: As Trump was leaving an event on Jan. 17th of this year, he waved to reporters. The video shows what appears to be bruises/blood on his right hand. When he was asked later by Fox News reporter Mark Meredith \u201cHow\u2019s your hand? It looks better now,\u201d Trump responded \"My hand?\" After some back and forth Trump responded \"Nothing. Maybe it was AI.\"\n\n\n\nanalysis: Because this photo was taken from a longer video, throughout which the bruises are visible, it is unlikely that this is an AI-generated photo or a more traditionally manipulated photo. In addition, our model trained to distinguish real from AI-generated images classifies this image as unlikely to be AI-generated. This may be an example of the liar's dividend where in the age of deepfakes it is has become increasingly easier to claim that something is fake.\n\n\n\nfact check: The Hill\n\nRepublican Victory in 2024\n\nFebruary 1, 2024 | manipulated images [ 1 | 2 ]\n\n\n\ncontent: Posted on twitter.com by Patrick Ruffini and racking up over 2 million views, these images were accompanied with the tweet \"Republican victory in 2024 depends on their being able to do this.\"\n\n\n\nanalysis: These images are AI-generated. The man on the right in the first image has three arms and the text on the hat and shirt are gibberish -- common artifacts of today's generative AI. Similarly, the text in the second image is gibberish, and the American flag in the foreground appears to have only one star. In addition, our model trained to distinguish real from AI-generated images classifies these images as highly likely to be AI-generated.\n\n\n\nfact check: this one is easy\n\nBiden in Fatigues\n\nJanuary 30, 2024 | manipulated images [ 1 | 2 | 3 ]\n\n\n\ncontent: A series of photos circulated on twitter.com purportedly showing President Biden in military fatigues on the verge of authorizing military strikes.\n\n\n\nanalysis: The image is AI-generated.

The call urged voters not to vote in the primary and to \"save your vote for the November election.\" The call went on to say \"voting this Tuesday only enables the Republicans in their quest to elect Donald Trump again. Your vote makes a difference in November, not this Tuesday.\" It is currently unclear who is behind these calls.\n\n\n\nanalysis: The quality of the deepfake voice is quite low and it is fairly clear from the voice and cadence that it is AI-generated. In addition, our models, trained to distinguish real from fake audio, classifies, with high confidence, this audio has AI-generated.\n\n\n\nfact check: NBC News\n\n\n\nupdate: New Hampshire Attorney General John Formella announced on Feb 6, 2024 that his office has identified two businesses beind these robocalls, Life Corporation and Lingo Telecom. Formella said \"We have issued a cease-and-desist letter to Life Corporation that orders the company to immediately desist violating New Hampshire election laws. We have also opened a criminal investigation, and we are taking next steps in that investigation, sending document preservation notices and subpoenas to Life Corporation, Lingo Telecom, and any other individual or entity\" [source]\n\nAn AI-generated Rep. Dean Phillips\n\nJanuary 18, 2024 | manipulated audio\n\n\n\ncontent: A super PAC supporting Rep. Dean Phillips' campaign created an interactive AI-powered version of Rep. Phillips. The bot was powered by OpenAI's ChatGPT and AI-powered voice cloning/synthesis. OpenAI forbids the use of its tools in political campaigns and shortly after the bot's release, OpenAI suspsended the creator's account. This is not the first AI-powered candidate; A similar interactive AI-bot was created of Mayor Suarez (see July 8, 2023 entry below).\n\n\n\nanalysis: The bot creators and the bot itself acknowledge it is AI-generated.\n\n\n\nfact check: Washington Post and Washington Post\n\nBiden Sending F15s to Texas\n\nJanuary 13, 2024 | manipulated audio\n\n\n\ncontent: As tensions flared between Texas and the US Government over access to the U.S.-Mexico border, this audio spread across TikTok claiming to be President Biden saying \"We\u2019re going to make sure those cowboys don\u2019t stop the surge of military-age men from entering. If we have to send F-15s to Texas here and wage war against Texas, so be it.\" Similar videos spread on twitter.com.\n\n\n\nanalysis: The White House claims the audio is fake, and there is no public record of President Biden saying anything to this effect. The audio has tell-tale signs of being AI-generated in terms of the cadence of the speech.\n\n\n\nfact check: PolitiFact\n\nTrump and Epstein\n\nJanuary 4, 2024 | manipulated image\n\n\n\ncontent: Shortly after a Judge unsealed documents in the case of convicted child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein (who died in jail in 2019), this photo began circulated on twitter.com before circulated more broadly on various other platforms. The photo purports to show Donald Trump, Epstein and a young girl.\n\n\n\nanalysis: There are many tell-tale signs that this is an AI-generated photo, including the distorted fingers of the young girl as well as the distorted faces of the people in the background. In addition, our model trained to distinguish real from AI-generated images classifies this image as highly likely to be AI-generated.\n\n\n\nfact check: Snopes.com\n\nWhat Ron DeSantis Should Say But Won't\n\nSeptember 1, 2023 | manipulated video\n\n\n\ncontent: YouTube creator C3PMeme made this video of Ron DeSantis saying, in part, \"I've realized that I need to drop out of this race immediately. I was told I could be President by some very powerful people and I took some very bad advice... I never should have challenged President Trump, the greatest president of my life time... It's time to right this ship and help President Trump get reelected to make America great again.\"\n\n\n\nanalysis: From the fairly crude mouth motion and audio quality to the video description \"A deepfake of what Ron DeSantis might say if he dropped out of the race (which he should)\", this video is obviously a fake and was not created to be deceptive. Based on our forensic analysis, we find that the voice in this video is highly likely to be AI-generated.\n\n\n\nfact check: Forbes\n\nTrump Attacks Iowa\n\nJuly 17, 2023 | manipulated video\n\n\n\ncontent: A PAC supporting Ron DeSantis created an ad attacking former President Donald Trump. The ad takes issue with Trump's attack on Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds. In the video ad, we hear Trump's voice criticizing Reynolds. The text appears to be based on a post by Trump on Truth Social. The ad is scheduled to run in Iowa with at least a $1 million ad buy.\n\n\n\nanalysis: A person familiar with the ad confirmed that Trump's voice was AI generated.\n\n\n\nfact check: Politico | PolitiFact\n\nAsk AI Suarez\n\nJuly 8, 2023 | Ask AI Suarez\n\n\n\ncontent: A super PAC supporting Miami Mayor Francis Suarez's presidential run launched an interactive AI chatbot to engage with voters. Suarez's campaign denies being involved in creating this AI bot or what their PAC does.\n\n\n\nanalysis: The content is clearly labeled as AI generated. It appears that the bot mostly listens to a user's question and then directs them to a relevant stock video response.\n\n\n\nfact check: AP News\n\nTrump or Biden 2024\n\nJuly 8, 2023 | manipulated video\n\n\n\ncontent: AI-generated versions of Donald Trump and Joe Biden engaged in a user-prompted debate is streaming 24/7 on Twitch. The content is often riddled with offensive language and appears to be powered by a chatGPT-like language model for crafting the script, voice cloning, and a lip-sync video manipulation.\n\n\n\nanalysis: The content is clearly labeled as AI generated and parody.\n\nTrump Dancing with Young Girl\n\nJune 14, 2023 | manipulated image\n\n\n\ncontent: An image purportedly showing Donald Trump dancing with a young girl spread on Twitter and TikTok. This image was not associated with a political advertisement.\n\n\n\nanalysis: The image contains physical inconsistencies consistent with AI generation including a misformed hand of the man in the background with six fingers grasping a glass of beer. The girl's left eye contains a specular reflection consistent with, for example, a camera flash, but her right eye improbably does not contain the same reflection.\n\n\n\nTrump's campaign accused the DeSantis campaign which has previously created fake images of Trump (see below). The DeSantis campaign denied the allegation.\n\n\n\nfact check: Newsweek | AP News\n\nLeaked Trump Tape\n\nJune 11, 2023 | manipulated audio\n\n\n\ncontent: This audio was created by Matthew Ellis with full disclosure that it is a deepfake.

The purpose of this video it is to illustrate the severity of Trump's actions listed in the Indictment and to show how AI and Fake Audio/Video recordings need to be flagged by Platforms and Content Creators.\"\n\n\n\nanalysis: This audio is clearly labeled as a deepfake. It is included here to show the quality of AI-cloned voices.\n\n\n\nfact check:\n\nDeSantis Campaign Ad\n\nJune 7, 2023 | manipulated images [00:24-00:30 sec]\n\n\n\ncontent: A DeSantis campaign video was releaased attacking Donald Trump by showing, in part, a montage of photos of Trump embracing Dr. Fauci.\n\n\n\nanalysis: Three of the photos in the six-photo montage (top-left, bottom-center, and bottom-right) show clear signs of AI-generatation. Each of these images contain physical inconsistencies including: the text on the White House logo is nonsensical (top-left), the stars on the flag are misshapen (bottom-center), and the shape of Trump's ear is inconsistent with reference images (bottom-right).\n\n\n\nfact check: Agence France-Presse (AFP)\n\nDeSantis and Musk on Twitter\n\nMay 23, 2023 | manipulated audio\n\n\n\ncontent: Former President Donald Trump released an AI-generated clip of a fake Twitter Spaces event consisting of a conversation between Elon Musk, George Soros, Klaus Schwab, an incessantly coughing Dick Cheney, Satan, and Adolf Hitler. This clip was released after the glitchy Twitter Spaces launch of DeSantis' presidential announcement.\n\n\n\nanalysis: The addition of Hitler and The Devil makes it obvious that this audio is fake.\n\n\n\nfact check: Gizmodo\n\nHarris Rambling Speech\n\nMay 4, 2023 | manipulated video\n\n\n\ncontent: A recorded speech originally given by Vice President Harris on April 25, 2023 at Howard University was digitally altered to replace the original voice track with a seemingly inebriated and rambling voice saying \"Today is today, and yesterday was today yesterday, tomorrow will be today tomorrow so live today so the future today will be as the past today as it is tomorrow.\"\n\n\n\nanalysis: There are clear signs of audio/video misalignment. The original video was eventually released showing the same clothing and background, and the impersonated audio was traced back to a TikTok user @mommyrn88. It is not entirely clear if this is a lipsync deepfake or just a classic audio/video dubbing.\n\n\n\nfact check: Reuters\n\nRNC's Biden Ad\n\nApril 25, 2023 | manipulated video\n\n\n\ncontent: Shortly after President Biden announced his bid for reelection, the Republican National Committee (RNC) released a video ad featuring a series of fake images. The video imagines \"what if crimes worsens,\" \"what if international tensions escalate,\" and \"what if the financial system crumbles,\" each with an associated fake image showing the corresponding apocalyptic future.\n\n\n\nanalysis: A small disclaimer in the top left of the frame says \"built entirely with AI imagery,\" and the caption underneath the YouTube video reads, \"An AI-generated look into the country's possible future if Joe Biden is re-elected in 2024.\"\n\n\n\nfact check: The Verge\n\nTrump Praying\n\nMarch 24, 2023 | manipulated image\n\n\n\ncontent: Weeks before the first indictment of former President Donald Trump, a series of fake images circulated online showing his arrest. In response, Trump shared his own fake image on Truth Social showing him kneeling in prayer.\n\n\n\nanalysis: Initial versions of AI-generated images struggled to create realistic and physically consistent hands. In this image, Trump's fingers are misformed. The faces of the men in the background are also highly distorted, consistent with physical inconsistencies made by generative AI systems.\n\n\n\nfact check: BBC\n\nBiden on Banking Turmoil\n\nMarch 15, 2023 | manipulated audio\n\n\n\ncontent: Following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and the resulting financial instability, an audio clip purportedly of President Biden was released in which he is heard saying, in part, \"all the money is gone\" and \"a collapse is imminent.\"\n\n\n\nanalysis: When separated from the recording, the background noise has a highly regular pattern that appears to be synthetic and not the result of a physically noisy system.

        "text": "Deepfakes in the 2024 US Presidential Election\nPSA\n\nMarch 23, 2024 | manipulated video\n\n\n\ncontent: To raise awareness of the potential danger of deepfakes, the Arizona Agenda created a deepfake of Senate candidate Kari Lake. The deepfake Lake is made to reveal she is a deepfake. The creators write: \"Welcome to the terrifying new age of artificial intelligence deepfakes. It\u2019s only beginning. The 2024 election is going to be the first in history where any idiot with a computer can create convincing videos depicting fake events of global importance and publish them to the world in a matter of minutes. Including us.\"\n\n\n\nanalysis: The content is clearly labeled as AI generated.\n\n\n\nfact check: Arizona Agenda\n\nBiden on Kyiv\n\nMarch 22, 2024 | manipulated video\n\n\n\ncontent: Posted on twitter.com by an account with a track record of spreading disinformation, this video purports to show President Biden erroneously saying Russia has occupied Kyiv for 10 years (Russia invidated Crimea in 2014, not Kyiv).\n\n\n\nanalysis: Our analysis of the audio using a model trained to distinguish real from AI-generated speech confidently classifies the audio as AI-generated. Our analysis of the video with a second model trained to detect inconsistencies between the mouth movement and spoken words also reveals evidence that this video is a lip-sync deepfake in which President Biden's mouth has been synthesized to be consistent with the AI-generated voice.\n\n\n\nfact check: AFP\n\nTrump and Black Voters\n\nMarch 4, 2024 | manipulated image\n\n\n\ncontent: In a repeat of the February 1, 2024 entry below, a new batch of fake photos purportedly showing Donald Trump with Black voters continue to circulate on social media in, it would seem, an attempt to court Black voters.\n\n\n\nanalysis: Our analysis has detected patterns in this image that are consistent with the generative-AI service Midjourney. In addition, it has been reported by the BBC that one photo was created by the Florida-based conservative radio show host Mark Kaye. \u201cI'm not out there taking pictures of what\u2019s really happening. I\u2019m a storyteller,\u201d Kaye told BBC. \u201cI\u2019m not claiming it is accurate. I\u2019m not saying, \u2018Hey, look, Donald Trump was at this party with all of these African American voters. Look how much they love him.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nfact check: BBC\n\nFred Trump\n\nFebruary 18, 2024 | manipulated video\n\n\n\ncontent: On the heals of Donald Trump accusing some in the media of using AI to create unflattering footage of him, the Lincoln Project (a centrist PAC), released an AI-generated video of Trump's father, Fred Trump saying things like \"Everyone knows why the women leave you, you're boring, broke, and I told you not to get fat. You pay porn stars and you are weak down there. Your kids hate you, especially the girl. How did a son of mine turn out so damn dumb? The brand I built is crap because of you. You're trash. You'll be lucky to stay out of jail.\"\n\n\n\nanalysis: The video contains the disclosure \"This video has been manipulated by technical means and depicts speech or conduct that did not occur.\"\n\n\n\nfact check: Futurism\n\nTrump's Bloody Hand\n\nFebruary 1, 2024 | photo in question\n\n\n\ncontent: As Trump was leaving an event on Jan. 17th of this year, he waved to reporters. The video shows what appears to be bruises/blood on his right hand. When he was asked later by Fox News reporter Mark Meredith \u201cHow\u2019s your hand? It looks better now,\u201d Trump responded \"My hand?\" After some back and forth Trump responded \"Nothing. Maybe it was AI.\"\n\n\n\nanalysis: Because this photo was taken from a longer video, throughout which the bruises are visible, it is unlikely that this is an AI-generated photo or a more traditionally manipulated photo. In addition, our model trained to distinguish real from AI-generated images classifies this image as unlikely to be AI-generated. This may be an example of the liar's dividend where in the age of deepfakes it is has become increasingly easier to claim that something is fake.\n\n\n\nfact check: The Hill\n\nRepublican Victory in 2024\n\nFebruary 1, 2024 | manipulated images [ 1 | 2 ]\n\n\n\ncontent: Posted on twitter.com by Patrick Ruffini and racking up over 2 million views, these images were accompanied with the tweet \"Republican victory in 2024 depends on their being able to do this.\"\n\n\n\nanalysis: These images are AI-generated. The man on the right in the first image has three arms and the text on the hat and shirt are gibberish -- common artifacts of today's generative AI. Similarly, the text in the second image is gibberish, and the American flag in the foreground appears to have only one star. In addition, our model trained to distinguish real from AI-generated images classifies these images as highly likely to be AI-generated.\n\n\n\nfact check: this one is easy\n\nBiden in Fatigues\n\nJanuary 30, 2024 | manipulated images [ 1 | 2 | 3 ]\n\n\n\ncontent: A series of photos circulated on twitter.com purportedly showing President Biden in military fatigues on the verge of authorizing military strikes.\n\n\n\nanalysis: The image is AI-generated. There are tell-tale signs of misinformed objects on the table, and our geometric analysis of the ceiling tiles reveals a physically inconsistent vanishing point.\n\n\n\nfact check: AFP Fact Check\n\nWhat a Bunch of Malarkey\n\nJanuary 22, 2024 | manipulated audio\n\n\n\ncontent: In the lead up to the New Hampshire Democratic primary, voters in the state received robocalls impersonating President Biden. The call urged voters not to vote in the primary and to \"save your vote for the November election.\" The call went on to say \"voting this Tuesday only enables the Republicans in their quest to elect Donald Trump again. Your vote makes a difference in November, not this Tuesday.\" It is currently unclear who is behind these calls.\n\n\n\nanalysis: The quality of the deepfake voice is quite low and it is fairly clear from the voice and cadence that it is AI-generated. In addition, our models, trained to distinguish real from fake audio, classifies, with high confidence, this audio has AI-generated.\n\n\n\nfact check: NBC News\n\n\n\nupdate: New Hampshire Attorney General John Formella announced on Feb 6, 2024 that his office has identified two businesses beind these robocalls, Life Corporation and Lingo Telecom. Formella said \"We have issued a cease-and-desist letter to Life Corporation that orders the company to immediately desist violating New Hampshire election laws. We have also opened a criminal investigation, and we are taking next steps in that investigation, sending document preservation notices and subpoenas to Life Corporation, Lingo Telecom, and any other individual or entity\" [source]\n\nAn AI-generated Rep. Dean Phillips\n\nJanuary 18, 2024 | manipulated audio\n\n\n\ncontent: A super PAC supporting Rep. Dean Phillips' campaign created an interactive AI-powered version of Rep. Phillips. The bot was powered by OpenAI's ChatGPT and AI-powered voice cloning/synthesis. OpenAI forbids the use of its tools in political campaigns and shortly after the bot's release, OpenAI suspsended the creator's account. This is not the first AI-powered candidate; A similar interactive AI-bot was created of Mayor Suarez (see July 8, 2023 entry below).\n\n\n\nanalysis: The bot creators and the bot itself acknowledge it is AI-generated.\n\n\n\nfact check: Washington Post and Washington Post\n\nBiden Sending F15s to Texas\n\nJanuary 13, 2024 | manipulated audio\n\n\n\ncontent: As tensions flared between Texas and the US Government over access to the U.S.-Mexico border, this audio spread across TikTok claiming to be President Biden saying \"We\u2019re going to make sure those cowboys don\u2019t stop the surge of military-age men from entering. If we have to send F-15s to Texas here and wage war against Texas, so be it.\" Similar videos spread on twitter.com.\n\n\n\nanalysis: The White House claims the audio is fake, and there is no public record of President Biden saying anything to this effect. The audio has tell-tale signs of being AI-generated in terms of the cadence of the speech.\n\n\n\nfact check: PolitiFact\n\nTrump and Epstein\n\nJanuary 4, 2024 | manipulated image\n\n\n\ncontent: Shortly after a Judge unsealed documents in the case of convicted child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein (who died in jail in 2019), this photo began circulated on twitter.com before circulated more broadly on various other platforms. The photo purports to show Donald Trump, Epstein and a young girl.\n\n\n\nanalysis: There are many tell-tale signs that this is an AI-generated photo, including the distorted fingers of the young girl as well as the distorted faces of the people in the background. In addition, our model trained to distinguish real from AI-generated images classifies this image as highly likely to be AI-generated.\n\n\n\nfact check: Snopes.com\n\nWhat Ron DeSantis Should Say But Won't\n\nSeptember 1, 2023 | manipulated video\n\n\n\ncontent: YouTube creator C3PMeme made this video of Ron DeSantis saying, in part, \"I've realized that I need to drop out of this race immediately. I was told I could be President by some very powerful people and I took some very bad advice... I never should have challenged President Trump, the greatest president of my life time... It's time to right this ship and help President Trump get reelected to make America great again.\"\n\n\n\nanalysis: From the fairly crude mouth motion and audio quality to the video description \"A deepfake of what Ron DeSantis might say if he dropped out of the race (which he should)\", this video is obviously a fake and was not created to be deceptive. Based on our forensic analysis, we find that the voice in this video is highly likely to be AI-generated.\n\n\n\nfact check: Forbes\n\nTrump Attacks Iowa\n\nJuly 17, 2023 | manipulated video\n\n\n\ncontent: A PAC supporting Ron DeSantis created an ad attacking former President Donald Trump. The ad takes issue with Trump's attack on Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds. In the video ad, we hear Trump's voice criticizing Reynolds. The text appears to be based on a post by Trump on Truth Social. The ad is scheduled to run in Iowa with at least a $1 million ad buy.\n\n\n\nanalysis: A person familiar with the ad confirmed that Trump's voice was AI generated.\n\n\n\nfact check: Politico | PolitiFact\n\nAsk AI Suarez\n\nJuly 8, 2023 | Ask AI Suarez\n\n\n\ncontent: A super PAC supporting Miami Mayor Francis Suarez's presidential run launched an interactive AI chatbot to engage with voters. Suarez's campaign denies being involved in creating this AI bot or what their PAC does.\n\n\n\nanalysis: The content is clearly labeled as AI generated. It appears that the bot mostly listens to a user's question and then directs them to a relevant stock video response.\n\n\n\nfact check: AP News\n\nTrump or Biden 2024\n\nJuly 8, 2023 | manipulated video\n\n\n\ncontent: AI-generated versions of Donald Trump and Joe Biden engaged in a user-prompted debate is streaming 24/7 on Twitch. The content is often riddled with offensive language and appears to be powered by a chatGPT-like language model for crafting the script, voice cloning, and a lip-sync video manipulation.\n\n\n\nanalysis: The content is clearly labeled as AI generated and parody.\n\nTrump Dancing with Young Girl\n\nJune 14, 2023 | manipulated image\n\n\n\ncontent: An image purportedly showing Donald Trump dancing with a young girl spread on Twitter and TikTok. This image was not associated with a political advertisement.\n\n\n\nanalysis: The image contains physical inconsistencies consistent with AI generation including a misformed hand of the man in the background with six fingers grasping a glass of beer. The girl's left eye contains a specular reflection consistent with, for example, a camera flash, but her right eye improbably does not contain the same reflection.\n\n\n\nTrump's campaign accused the DeSantis campaign which has previously created fake images of Trump (see below). The DeSantis campaign denied the allegation.\n\n\n\nfact check: Newsweek | AP News\n\nLeaked Trump Tape\n\nJune 11, 2023 | manipulated audio\n\n\n\ncontent: This audio was created by Matthew Ellis with full disclosure that it is a deepfake.

        "text": "Election 2024: Are Americans Turning Isolationist?\nMark Twain upon reading his obituary in 1897 quipped that \u201cthe report of my death was an exaggeration.\u201d Repeated talk that the American public is turning isolationist merits a similar reaction. American internationalism may have weakened in recent years, but it is hardly dead and buried.\n\nConsider first how Americans respond to a question that the Chicago Council on Global Affairs has been asking for half a century: \u201cDo you think it will be best for the future of the country if we take an active part in world affairs or if we stay out of world affairs?\u201d In the most recent survey, 57 percent of respondents opted for playing an active role. In contrast, 42 percent favored staying out of world affairs. This is down from 70 percent in 2018, but above the survey low, which was 54 percent in 1982. The Reagan years are seldom offered up as the era of isolationism.\n\nA recent Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found a similar public tilt toward internationalism. In their poll, 23 percent wanted the United States to take a more active role in solving world problems, and 36 percent said that the current level of U.S. involvement is about right. In contrast, just 40 percent wanted the United States to be less active.\n\nThe Water's Edge James M.

The Chicago Council, for instance, has repeatedly found that Americans support maintaining U.S. military bases in Europe and Asia by substantial margins, while two-thirds believe that U.S. support for Taiwan strengthens U.S. national security and majorities support U.S. participation in a range of international agreements.\n\nIt's not just Chicago Council polls that find the American public favoring internationalism rather than isolationism. A Gallup poll last month found that two out of three Americans want the United States to keep or increase its commitment to NATO. Just 16 percent favor decreasing the U.S. commitment to NATO and only 12 percent\u2014or fewer than one out of every eight Americans\u2014want the United States to withdraw from NATO.\n\nWhen the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research recently asked whether the United States should take a more or less active role in the war between Ukraine and Russia, 40 percent said that the current role is about right and 22 percent wanted the United States to do more. The numbers on the war between Israel and Hamas were about the same\u201441 percent and 21 percent.\n\nSo, if the American public isn\u2019t clamoring for Washington to shed its overseas commitments, why does it seem that the United States is preparing to turn its back on the world? I will address that question in next week\u2019s post.\n\nCampaign Update\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence said last Friday that he will not vote for Trump for president in November. Pence attributed his decision to more than Trump\u2019s actions on January 6, 2021. The former vice president said he believed that \u201cDonald Trump is pursuing and articulating an agenda that is at odds with the conservative agenda that we governed on during our four years.\u201d Pence declined to say who he would vote for other than to declare that \u201cI would never vote for Joe Biden.\u201d\n\nThe United Steelworkers union endorsed Biden for president on Wednesday. The decision comes just days after Biden announced his opposition to Nippon Steel\u2019s offer to buy U.S. Steel. United Steelworkers represents some 850,000 workers, many of whom live in battleground states. United Steelworkers President David McCall said that \u201cPresident Biden proved time and again during his first term that he stands with working families.\u201d\n\nThe Candidates in Their Own Words\n\nTrump made some foreign policy news this week, starting with his rally Saturday night outside Dayton, Ohio. Most of the attention was devoted to his comment that there will be a \u201cbloodbath\u201d if Biden wins in November. That prompted a spitting match between Trump critics saying that Trump was inciting violence and Trump supporters saying that he was pointing out that Biden\u2019s policies are hurting the U.S. automobile industry. Here is the relevant passage:\n\nChina now is building a couple of massive plants where they\u2019re going to build the cars in Mexico and think, they think that they\u2019re going to sell those cars into the United States with no tax at the border. Let me tell you something to China, if you\u2019re listening, President Xi, and you and I are friends, but he understands the way I deal, those big monster car manufacturing plants that you\u2019re building in Mexico right now, and you think you\u2019re going to get that, you\u2019re going to not hire Americans and you\u2019re going to sell the cars to us. Now, we\u2019re going to put a 100% tariff on every single car that comes across the line, and you\u2019re not going to be able to sell those cars, if I get elected. Now, if I don\u2019t get elected, it\u2019s going to be a bloodbath for the whole\u2026 That\u2019s going to be the least of it. It\u2019s going to be a bloodbath for the country. That\u2019ll be the least of it. But they\u2019re not going to sell those cars.\n\nYou can judge whether the \u201cleast of it\u201d phrase broadens Trump\u2019s claim beyond autos or not. What got lost in the coverage was the accuracy of Trump\u2019s claim that China electric vehicle manufacturers, which are hyper-efficient and subsidized by the Chinese government, will use Mexico to flood the U.S. market with cheap electric vehicles. It turns out that the country-of-origins requirement in the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, which Trump negotiated, will go a long way toward eliminating China\u2019s cost advantage, unless Chinese manufacturers find ways to source a substantial percentage of their parts from U.S. manufacturers.\n\nIn a Sunday appearance on Fox News\u2019 MediaBuzz, Trump was asked what advice he would give Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Trump answered: \u201cYou have to finish it up and do it quickly and get back to the world of peace. We need peace in the world\u2026we need peace in the Middle East.\u201d In the same interview, Trump said he couldn\u2019t for sure say whether Russian President Vladimir Putin was responsible for the death of imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny: \u201cI don\u2019t know, but perhaps, I mean possibly, I could say probably, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Trump went on to say that Navalny was \u201ca young man, so statistically he\u2019d be alive for a long time\u2026 so something happened that was unusual.\u201d When asked if he \u201cwould be willing to see Putin to swallow part or all of Ukraine,\u201d Trump answered: \u201cI hope that it doesn\u2019t come to that.\u201d\n\nIn an appearance on the podcast America First With Sebastian Gorka that was posted online on Monday, Trump\u2019s former aide asked why he thought that Democrats like Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer were criticizing Netanyahu. Trump answered: \u201cI actually think they hate Israel. I think they hate Israel. And the Democrat party hates Israel.\u201d He went on to add: \u201cAny Jewish person that votes for Democrats hates their religion.\u201d\n\nIn an interview released on Tuesday night, Trump discussed foreign policy with Nigel Farage, the former head of Britain\u2019s Brexit Party. Trump said that the United States would \u201c100 percent\u201d remain in NATO should he win in November if Europe paid \u201cits fair share\u201d of NATO\u2019s costs. \u201cNATO has to treat the U.S. fairly, because if it\u2019s not for the United States, NATO literally doesn\u2019t even exist,\u201d Trump warned. He added: \u201cWe have an ocean in between some problems \u2026 we have a nice big, beautiful ocean.\u201d Eighteen of NATO\u2019s thirty-two member countries currently spend at least 2 percent of their GDP on defense, the target the alliance set at its 2014 summit. The stragglers, not surprisingly, are all countries located the furthest from Russia\u2019s western border.\n\nTrump also used the interview to say that he \u201cgot along great with Putin\u201d and that the Russian president is someone he can negotiate with. When Farage said that former Australian Prime Minister and current Australian ambassador to the United States Kevin Rudd had called Trump a \u201ctraitor to the West,\u201d the potential next American president responded that Rudd won\u2019t be ambassador to the United States for \u201clong if that\u2019s the case\u201d and \u201cI hear he\u2019s not the brightest bulb.\u201d\n\nWhat the Pundits Are Saying\n\nThe New York Times\u2019s Angelo Fichera assessed Trump\u2019s claims that if he had been president for the past three years that Russia would not have invaded Ukraine, Hamas never would have attacked Israel, and the United States wouldn\u2019t have seen the inflation rate spike. Fichera concluded that \u201cTrump\u2019s suppositions underscore the ways in which he often airs questionable claims without explanation and which might not be supported by the broader context. And unlike simply attacking an opponent\u2019s record or making a campaign promise, such alternative realities enjoy the benefit of being untestable.\u201d\n\nThe Financial Times\u2019s Alan Beattie castigated Biden\u2019s decision to oppose Nippon Steel\u2019s purchase of U.S. Steel, the subject of the lead essay in last week\u2019s campaign roundup. Beattie called the decision \u201cway out of proportion. Iron and steel manufacture directly employs around 80,000 people in the US, 0.06 per cent of the total workforce and comfortably less than half the number of American pedicurists and manicurists. US Steel itself has just over 20,000 workers, half the number of employees at Penn State University.\u201d He added that \u201cUS trade policy is disturbingly vibes-based. There\u2019s a vague sense of the need to be seen fighting trade wars rather than actually creating jobs.\u201d\n\nSemafor\u2019s Jay Solomon reported that Trump may offer Republican Senators Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, and Marco Rubio of Florida senior national security roles in his administration should he return to the White House. Other names Trump is reportedly considering for senior posts include veterans of his administration: \u201cformer Secretary of State Mike Pompeo; John Ratcliffe, a one-time congressman who served as Director of National Intelligence; former National Security Advisor Robert O\u2019Brien; and Trump\u2019s ambassador to Germany, Ric Grenell.\u201d\n\nBloomberg\u2019s Jennifer Jacobs and Justin Sink reported that Trump has decided against naming Vivek Ramaswamy as his running mate, but he is considering offering his former campaign rival the position of secretary of Homeland Security. According to the report, \u201csome Trump allies see Ramaswamy as ideal for the job because they say he excels at public speaking and, as an Indian-American son of an immigrant, could neutralize criticism of sweeping immigration restrictions.\u201d\n\nForeign Policy\u2019s James Crabtree argued that Asian leaders are wrong to be relaxed, unlike their European counterparts, about the prospect of Trump\u2019s return to the White House. \u201cThis calm in Asian capitals borders on hubris,\u201d according to Crabtree. \u201cIt misjudges the impact Trump\u2019s return could have on Asian security and misreads the scale and ambition of his plans to remodel U.S. foreign policy. It also overstates the ability of Asian governments\u2014from core U.S. allies to the more nonaligned nations in Southeast Asia and elsewhere\u2014to manage Trump.\u201d\n\nThe Financial Times\u2019s Martin Wolf accused Trump of threating to \u201chand his friend, Vladimir Putin, victory over Ukraine.\u201d The columnist wrote that to abandon Ukrainians \u201cnow in their hour of great need would demonstrate catastrophic western weakness at a moment of potential success: Russia would rejoice; the western alliance would crumble; and many would conclude that the US is in irreversible decline. For the US and the world, this truly is a decisive moment.\u201d\n\nRobin Niblett wrote in Foreign Policy that the G-7 summit, which is set to meet in Italy in June, is critical, and not just because it is a landmark anniversary\u2014the fiftieth. In Niblett\u2019s view the G-7\u2019s challenge is \u201cwhether to cement the gains of the Biden presidency or lessen the global risks of a Trump presidency.\u201d\n\nWhat the Polls Show\n\nGallup asked Americans to name the country\u2019s \u201cgreatest enemy today.\u201d Forty-one percent said China, while 26 percent said Russia. That was a decline of nine points in the case of China compared to last year and six points in the case of Russia. Nine percent named Iran as the greatest enemy today, up from just 2 percent last year. Disagreements between Democrats and Republicans carried over to naming the country\u2019s greatest enemy. Democrats cited Russia most often (48 percent), while Republicans (67 percent) and Independents (40 percent) cited China. Americans\u2019 favorite countries, as measured by the percentage with \u201cvery favorable\u201d or \u201cmostly favorable\u201d ratings, are Canada (83 percent), Japan (83 percent), Great Britain (82 percent), Germany (79 percent), and France (78 percent). Gallup did not run that survey question by the Chinese government as it considers Taiwan a country, which the United States doesn\u2019t. The self-governing island had a combined favorability rating of 77 percent, putting it ahead of U.S. treaty ally South Korea (72 percent).\n\nThe Campaign Schedule\n\nRobert F. Kennedy, Jr. is set to announce his vice-presidential running mate in four days (March 26, 2024).\n\nThe oral arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court on Trump\u2019s claim that he has blanket immunity for all his actions while president are set to begin in thirty-four days (April 25, 2024).\n\nThe Republican National Convention opens in Milwaukee in 115 days (July 15, 2024).\n\nThe Democratic National Convention opens in Chicago in 150 days (August 19, 2024).\n\nElection Day is 228 days away.\n\nInauguration Day is 304 days away.\n\nSinet Adous and Michelle Kurilla assisted in the preparation of this post.",

        "text": "Shirley 2024: Cast, Release Date, Shirley Chisholm True Story and Ending Explained - Netflix Tudum\nRegina King is running. The Oscar winner stars as political trailblazer Shirley Chisholm in a new film chronicling her groundbreaking run for president of the United States. In 1972, Chisholm became the first Black candidate to seek a major party\u2019s nomination for president. But she was already a pioneer: In 1968, the Brooklyn native made history as the first Black woman elected to the U.S. Congress. Written and directed by John Ridley (also an Oscar winner for his 12 Years a Slave screenplay), Shirley tells Chisholm\u2019s inspirational story.\n\nIn the trailer for Shirley, above, you can see King\u2019s transformation into Chisholm, as well as get a taste of her fiery spirit. \u201cYou sound just like every other politician,\u201d a voter tells Chisholm. \u201cDo I look like every other politician?\u201d she asks. Read on to find out more about Shirley.\n\nWhat is Shirley about?\n\nShirley tells the story of the first Black congresswoman, political icon Shirley Chisholm, and her trailblazing run for president. It chronicles her audacious, boundary-breaking 1972 presidential campaign.\n\nShirley Trailer\n\nWho was Shirley Chisholm?\n\nSisters, co-stars, and co-producers Regina and Reina King made Shirley to answer that very question. \u201cYou learned about Malcolm X, and you learned about Martin Luther King in U.S. history classes, but not this great, powerful woman,\u201d Reina King told Netflix. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t students being told about that? When I would mention Shirley\u2019s name, no one seemed to know who she was, and [that] lit a fire under us even more. We were like, \u2018The world should know, the country should know, women should know, people should know, kids should know.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIn that spirit, to reiterate once more: Shirley Chisholm was the first Black congresswoman elected to the U.S. House of Representatives and the first Black candidate to seek a major party\u2019s nomination, in the 1972 campaign covered in Shirley.\n\nBorn in Brooklyn in 1924, Chisholm spent much of her childhood with family in Barbados, developing a West Indian accent that would stay with her into adulthood. \u201cHaving spent time in Barbados and New York, she would sound Bajan sometimes and other times like someone from Brooklyn, and other times she sounded more scholarly, and sometimes it was a mix of all three because that\u2019s who she was,\u201d Regina King said. \u201cWorking with the dialect coach we said, \u2018You\u2019re not trying to mimic Shirley. What we need to do is find where Regina and Shirley intersect,\u2019 because that\u2019s what Shirley was always doing. She was always finding how she was going to meet whoever she was talking to where they were.\u201d\n\nThe team was also keen to depict Chisholm\u2019s sense of humor and style alongside her more serious moments. \u201cIn all of the research that we had done on Shirley and the people that we got to talk to who actually knew Shirley, the one thing they all said was that she loved to dance and that she was funny,\u201d Regina King said. \u201cBarbara Lee and Shirley\u2019s goddaughter told us that they\u2019ve never seen anyone that can curse someone out so well without using curse words.\u201d\n\nIs Shirley based on a true story?\n\nYes. Because Chisholm died in 2005, the filmmakers had to look to other sources. \u201cMost of the research we did was through her books, including Unbought and Unbossed and The Good Fight, documentaries, any news footage and articles, everything that we could pull to put us in the place that told us who Shirley was, and what was important to tell about her story,\u201d Reina King said.\n\nBut the film set did receive a visit from one of the people portrayed in Shirley: U.S. Representative Barbara Lee (D-CA). Lee got her start working on Chisholm\u2019s presidential campaign and is played in the film by Christina Jackson. \u201cHaving Barbara Lee come and visit the set was definitely like she was giving us Shirley\u2019s blessing in a lot of ways,\u201d Regina King said. \u201cBarbara represents just how someone can come into your life and not only inspire you, but kind of put a lightbulb in your head to let you know, \u2018Oh, this is what I\u2019m supposed to be doing. There is something within me that I have to give way beyond just this moment.\u2019 Shirley lit that fire in Barbara by example.\u201d\n\nTo learn more about Shirley\u2019s legacy and ways to take action, please visit Shirley1972.com.\n\nWhat does \u201cUnbought and Unbossed\u201d mean?\n\nChisholm\u2019s campaign slogan, \u201cUnbought and Unbossed,\u201d reflected her individual spirit and a promise to voters that she would work for them, rather than for wealthy special interests. It was also the title of her 1970 autobiography.\n\n\u201cI feel like she embodied that by marching to her own drummer,\u201d Reina King said. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t doing what was necessarily thought of for a woman to be doing at that time. She worked outside of the confines of the way things are supposed to go in politics, and no one was going to stop her from using her voice and getting out a message that was so important. She was just a maverick, a Goliath.\u201d\n\nWhat happens at the end of Shirley?\n\nShirley comes to a head at the end of the presidential primary: the 1972 Democratic National Convention, held in Miami Beach, Florida. At this point in the film, most people inside and outside Chisholm\u2019s campaign have conceded that victory is impossible. But hope emerges from an unlikely series of allies.\n\nFirst, a number of campaigns embark on a desperate bid to free up California\u2019s haul of winner-take-all delegates, held by frontrunner George McGovern. Then, one of Chisholm\u2019s primary opponents drops out and pledges their Black delegates to her campaign. Chisholm finds herself in a surprising position: She may not be able to win the primary, but if the convention extends past a first ballot, an influx of delegates could put her in a position to influence the Democratic Party\u2019s platform. At a meeting of Black delegates she implores the room to exercise political power by holding on to their votes.\n\nUnfortunately, it isn\u2019t meant to be. Chisholm loses the support of Rep. Walter Fauntroy (Andr\u00e9 Holland), who had pledged his delegates to her \u2014 but only in the event that the convention proceeded past a first ballot. Fauntroy slides through that loophole by instead pledging his delegates to McGovern on the first ballot. More upsettingly, Chisholm\u2019s friend and colleague Ron Dellums (Dorian Crossmond Missick) appears on television and pushes for delegates to support McGovern. With that, the campaign is over. Chisholm tells her team to release her delegates and retreats to her room, where she pledges to forgive Ron for succumbing to the political pressures she knows he must be facing.\n\nIt\u2019s a pivotal moment in Chisholm\u2019s career, and in the history of representative politics. Soon she\u2019s surrounded by her team, and she leaves them with a piece of wisdom: \u201cIf I can\u2019t get there today, you have to believe you can get there tomorrow.\u201d They take it to heart: Lee (Jackson), seated next to Chisholm, will go on to have her own congressional career. In the film\u2019s final scene, Lee appears as herself \u2014 one of the many who, to this day, continue to honor Chisholm\u2019s legacy.\n\nWho is in the cast of Shirley?\n\nRegina King as Shirley Chisholm About the Character King, who won an Oscar in 2018 for her gorgeous and understated turn in Barry Jenkins\u2019 If Beale Street Could Talk, takes on the role of the gutsy politician in Shirley. She and her sister, Reina (who also co-stars as Chisholm\u2019s sister), co-produced the film; it\u2019s been a passion project of theirs for years. \u201cReina and I first decided that Shirley\u2019s story was one that was important to tell when we realized separately and together how many people did not know who Shirley was,\u201d King told Netflix. \u201cSo often we only do things because we\u2019ve seen someone else do it. That\u2019s what lets us know that it\u2019s possible, as opposed to creating our own possibilities. Shirley was a maverick in that space. So, hopefully she would understand that that\u2019s the reason for telling this story.\u201d Previously In Jerry Maguire, Watchmen, If Beale Street Could Talk, Friday, Ray, Enemy of the State, The Leftovers, The Boondocks Watch them on Netflix Watch My List Watch My List Follow Regina King\n\nTerrence Howard as Arthur Hardwick About the Character Chisholm-campaign fundraiser and advisor Arthur Hardwick is played by Oscar-nominee Terrence Howard. He\u2019s a steadfast supporter who understands how inspiring the very existence of her campaign will be. Previously In Iron Man, Hustle & Flow, Ray, Prisoners, Empire, Four Brothers, Crash, Big Momma\u2019s House, Lee Daniels\u2019 The Butler, August Rush\n\nLance Reddick as Wesley \u201cMac\u201d Holder About the Character The late, great Lance Reddick plays Chisholm\u2019s loyal campaign advisor Wesley. Shirley was one of the final projects Reddick completed before his untimely death in 2023. He also appeared in King\u2019s feature-film directorial debut One Night in Miami\u2026 in 2020. \u201cLance really was a spirit that knew how to lift me up. He also helped me to remember to laugh,\u201d King said. \u201cThere are moments in the film where I see Shirley and Mac looking at each other and I see Lance and Regina looking at each other, and that\u2019s what will always be on film for me. I\u2019ll always have that. I\u2019m speaking selfishly, I know, to watch Lance cap off this amazing career that he had is a gift for me.\u201d Previously In The Wire, The Guest, White House Down, The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial, Fringe, Oz, Lost Watch them on Netflix Watch My List Follow Lance Reddick\n\nLucas Hedges as Robert Gottlieb About the Character A former congressional intern, Gottlieb takes on the role of youth coordinator in Chisholm\u2019s fledgling presidential campaign.

He\u2019s played by Andr\u00e9 Holland, who brought sultry passion to Moonlight with just a glance and a lit cigarette.

Stage and screen performer Michael Cherrie plays Conrad. Previously In She Paradise, Limbo Follow Michael Cherrie\n\nChristina Jackson as Barbara Lee About the Character Played by Christina Jackson, Barbara Lee is a campaign employee who brings a dash of her radical politics to Chisholm\u2019s strict operation. The real Barbara Lee is a current California representative who visited the set of Shirley. \u201cHaving Barbara Lee come and visit the set was definitely like she was giving us Shirley\u2019s blessing,\u201d King said. \u201cThe fact that Barbara Lee is still making moves that affect our lives as a Congresswoman is huge, and to know that it started with meeting Shirley that one time. So we looked at this film as a rallying cry and to show, by example, a snapshot of this relationship between these two women and how it\u2019s continued to nourish us.\u201d Previously In The Night House, Devotion, Outsiders, Deception Follow Christina Jackson\n\nReina King as Muriel St. Hill About the Character King\u2019s sister, Reina King, plays Chisholm\u2019s sister Muriel, one of her harshest critics. Frustrated by a campaign she sees as quixotic, Muriel isn\u2019t afraid to let her sister know. Reina also serves as co-producer on the film, and never expected to appear in it \u2014 she hasn\u2019t acted since 1998. \u201cI never thought that I was going to be in this film,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had been auditioning people to play Muriel and no one was quite cutting it. I blame this all on John Ridley. We were at a location scout and he steps to me and says, \u2018Reina, you and Regina are sisters. Why don\u2019t you do Muriel?\u2019 And my first thought was, \u2018No, that\u2019s not what I want to do.\u2019 And then it just happened and it made sense.\u201d It was their first time on-screen together.

        "text": "Issues and Trends in U.S. Presidential Election 2024\nThe U.S. presidential election, like national elections in most democracies, is mostly fought and won on domestic issues that have a direct bearing on the day-to-day lives of the American people. Foreign policy issues, while still significant for a global power like the United States, is largely peripheral and episodic in terms of influencing voting patterns. Nevertheless, more than any other election in the world, the process and result of the U.S. presidential election is keenly watched and has global repercussions. From the intra-party primaries to the presidential nominations, and then to the final verdict in November, candidates will have to grapple with a host of issues, based on which American voters will elect the next U.S. president. As the election season heats up, candidates will become more hyperbolic in asserting their best plans to save American democracy at home, and American leadership abroad. An assessment of the major domestic and foreign policy issues dominating the hearts and minds of American voters is, therefore, imperative.",

        "text": "Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador takes aim at U.S. politicians\nMexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador wields a lot of influence when it comes to curbing migrants illegally crossing the U.S. southern border. And as he made clear in a recent \"60 Minutes\" interview, he believes that power should be Mexico's to decide when to use.\n\nSpecifically, L\u00f3pez Obrador defended his country's sovereignty in response to hearing House Speaker Mike Johnson say recently that the U.S. could force Mexico to comply with American immigration policy.\n\n\"We are not a colony. We are not a protectorate of any foreign country,\" L\u00f3pez Obrador said through an interpreter to correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi in an interview earlier this month. \"And we have a very good relationship with the government of the United States \u2014 but not one of subordination.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson has called for President Biden to reinstate the \"Remain in Mexico\" policy for migrants seeking asylum in the U.S. While speaking to reporters last month, the Louisiana Republican recalled a conversation he had with Biden, in which Johnson urged him to reestablish the Trump-era policy and said it could potentially control the flow of migrants illegally entering the U.S.\n\n\"'Well, Mexico doesn't want that,'\" Johnson recalled the president answering.\n\n\"Mr. President,\" Johnson said he replied, \"we're the United States. Mexico will do what we say.\"\n\nFormer President Trump instated the Remain in Mexico policy, or Migrant Protection Protocols, in 2019. The program mandated that U.S. border officials return non-Mexican asylum seekers to Mexico, where they would wait for months \u2014 or even years \u2014 for their immigration cases to clear U.S. immigration courts. The U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 ruled 5-4 to rescind the policy.\n\nIn contrast to Johnson, L\u00f3pez Obrador told \"60 Minutes\" that Biden has been respectful of Mexico's sovereignty.\n\n\"Every time I speak with President Biden, the first thing he says to me is that our relationship must be on an equal footing,\" L\u00f3pez Obrador said.\n\nOther American politicians, however, have not understood this relationship, he said. Instead, they have heaped blame on Mexico for the migration challenge at the border, rather than reaching agreements and addressing what he sees as the root of the issue.\n\nL\u00f3pez Obrador also issued a critical assessment of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, whom he accessed of engaging in opportunism and \"cheap politicking\" with the border.\n\nTwo American politicians the Mexican president offered equal compliments for are the two men whose names are likely to be on the presidential ballot this fall. While L\u00f3pez Obrador will not be in office when Americans go to the polls in November \u2014 his own six-year term is up in September \u2014 his attitude toward both Biden and Trump suggests he wants to keep Mexico on good footing with Washington, no matter who wins the White House.\n\n\"President Trump, like President Biden, has been very respectful. Both of them,\" L\u00f3pez Obrador said. \"We have had differences, but we have been able to put first the general interest of both peoples, the people of the United States and the people of Mexico.\"\n\nThe video above was produced by Brit McCandless Farmer and edited by Scott Rosann.",

        "text": "Balance between fighting misinformation and protecting speech on social media gets more complicated\nMisinformation spreads online as some in Congress fight what they see as censorship\n\nAs the U.S. 2024 presidential election gets underway, social media companies are caught in an unenviable position: trying to stop the spread of misinformation while also facing more and more allegations of censorship.\n\nClaims of censorship online have, in some cases, stymied efforts to combat false election news shared online. The problem is not unique to the U.S.: high-stake elections are being held in dozens of countries around the world this year and some worry that misinformation could influence the results.\n\n\"Half of the world is voting this year and the world could stick with democracy or move toward authoritarianism,\" Darrell West, a senior fellow of technology innovation at the Brookings Institution, said. \"The danger is, disinformation could decide the elections in a number of different countries.\"\n\nHow combating misinformation online has changed in recent years\n\nAcademic researchers began working closely with social media platforms after evidence surfaced of Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nBig tech companies have wrestled with keeping false and harmful information off their platforms for years. They've suspended and banned accounts. The companies have removed or labeled posts deemed \"misinformation,\" sometimes adding warnings.\n\nDarrell West, a senior fellow of technology innovation at the Brookings Institution 60 Minutes\n\nFighting misinformation became a key tenet of the internet as the COVID-19 pandemic began. Robert Kennedy Jr. was temporarily banned from Instagram after posting false coronavirus vaccine claims. Over on Twitter, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene was suspended after she claimed COVID vaccines and masks didn't work.\n\nMisinformation continued to spread online during the 2020 election.\n\n\"We were very specifically looking at misinformation about election processes, procedures and election results,\" said Kate Starbird, a professor at the University of Washington and a leader of the Election Integrity Partnership, a group she helped launch in 2020. \"If we saw something about that, we would pass it along to the platforms if we thought it violated one of their policies.\"\n\nResearchers flagged a November 2020 tweet saying that election software in Michigan switched 6,000 votes from Trump to Biden. Twitter labeled the post with a warning.\n\nStarbird said her research has found that more misinformation is spread by conservatives.\n\n\"Not just our research, research across the board looking at the 2020 election found that there was more misinformation spread by people that were supporters of Donald Trump or conservatives,\" Starbird said. \"And the events of January 6th kind of underscore this.\"\n\nKate Starbird, a professor at the University of Washington and head of the Center for an Informed Public 60 Minutes\n\nBut some researchers like Starbird, who says she received a death threat for her work on misinformation, have stopped communicating with social media platforms.\n\nConfronted with criticism from conservatives, who claim their views were being censored, and because of cost-cutting, social media platforms began downsizing their fact-checking teams.\n\nWhy some in Congress say combating misinformation is stifling freedom of speech\n\nHouse Judiciary Committee chairman Jim Jordan, a Republican from Ohio, argues that tech companies shouldn't remove most of what they call misinformation.\n\n\"I think you let the American people, respect the American people, their common sense, to figure out what's accurate, what isn't,\" Jordan said in an interview.\n\nWhile Jordan acknowledges there is misinformation online, he sees a bigger problem in what he views as an attack on First Amendment liberties. His committee last year produced a report that concluded there was a \"censorship industrial complex\" where the federal government and tech companies colluded with academic researchers to disproportionately silence conservatives \u2014 an allegation that Starbird vigorously denies.\n\nJordan said her group has unfairly flagged posts, such as one by Newt Gingrich, who in 2020 tweeted: \"Pennsylvania democrats are methodically changing the rules so they can steal the election.\"\n\nJordan also complains that government officials put pressure on social media companies directly.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan 60 Minutes\n\n\"You can't have the government say, 'Hey, we want you to do X,'\" Jordan said. \"Government who has the ability to regulate these private companies, government which has the ability to tax these private companies.\"\n\nKatie Harbath, who spent a decade at Facebook working on the company's policies around election misinformation, said the platforms have their own First Amendment rights.\n\nShe said that while she was at Facebook, it was not unusual for the government to ask the company to remove content, something she said was appropriate as long as the government is not coercing.\n\n\"Conservatives are alleging that the platforms were taking down content at the behest of the government, which is not true,\" Harbath said. \"The platforms made their own decisions.\"\n\nMany times, the companies pushed back. In 2019, a doctored video of then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was posted online, slowed down to make it seem as if she was slurring. The video stayed up because it didn't violate Facebook's policies, Harbath said.\n\n\"She was definitely not pleased,\" Harbath said of Pelosi.\n\nCourt battles over misinformation, free speech online-\n\nThe conservatives' campaign faced a setback at the Supreme Court on Monday when a majority of the justices seemed poised to reject their effort to limit attempts by the government to influence social media.\n\nIn other cases, the court will look at laws passed in Texas and Florida to determine whether tech companies are like news organizations \u2014with a First Amendment right to control who and what information appears on their sites\u2014 or like telephone companies, entities merely transmitting speech.\n\nIf those state laws are upheld, the platforms could be forced to carry hate speech and false medical information, some warn. West, the senior fellow of technology innovation at the Brookings Institution, said the clash over what's true is fraying our institutions and threatening democracies around the world.\n\n\"The toothpaste is out of the tube and we have to figure out how to deal with the resulting mess,\" West said.",

        "text": "Canada is already preparing for Trump's potential tariff threats\nCBC News got exclusive access to the Canadian lobbying effort on Capitol Hill to ensure that a transition goes smoothly if former U.S. president Donald Trump returns to the White House, especially because of the challenges expected in light of his America First policy.\n\nCanada staged a large-scale diplomatic deployment this week in preparation for a U.S. presidential election of more consequence than usual.\n\nMore than a dozen Canadian diplomats posted in various U.S. cities came to Washington to meet with scores of American lawmakers on Capitol Hill.\n\nLooming over their visit was the potential return of Donald Trump to the White House. In particular, there's one Trump policy they're watching warily this year.\n\nThe former president has promised a worldwide tariff on imported goods if he wins. This would be stricter than any trade policy from his first term.\n\nTrump has offered minimal details about the policy in his campaign literature and in media interviews but has said he envisions a 10 per cent global tax.\n\nWould that apply to Canada?\n\nNeither Canadian officials, nor Trump's allies, have a clear answer on that. Trump has been vague about which countries and products might be included or exempted.\n\nBut Canada's starting position, as one might expect, is that, no, there should not be penalties on a country \u2014 ours \u2014 that recently signed a free-trade agreement with Trump, which he has praised repeatedly as the best ever.\n\n\"We will have a serious conversation with them if they're looking to apply that policy to us,\" Kirsten Hillman, Canada's ambassador, told CBC News.\n\n\"But I think the starting point is that it shouldn't \u2014 and we have just concluded a deal that is 99 per cent tariff-free,\" she said, referring to the new NAFTA.\n\nKirsten Hillman, Canadian ambassador to the U.S., led a delegation that consisted of a dozen Canadian consuls-general to various U.S. cities as they met with over 50 members of Congress this week. (CBC)\n\nTariffs on Canada? Depends who you ask\n\nIt's worth watching Trump's platform closely, as current polls give him a decent chance of being returned to office in the November election.\n\nEven in Washington there's no clear consensus on what his policy might ultimately look like. Ask different people about tariffs on Canada, and you'll get different answers.\n\n\"I have a hard time believing that would be the case,\" Michigan Republican congressman Bill Huizenga told CBC News. \"Especially when it comes to the trade agreement that he negotiated, and led.\"\n\nNorth Dakota Sen. Kevin Cramer says that's exactly what he tells Trump: \"We talk about these things a fair bit,\" he said. \"I think we should have a North American strategy. Not a U.S.-only strategy.\"\n\nSen. Kevin Cramer, seen here in 2018 with Trump, says he speaks frequently to the former president and advises him against tariffs within North America. (Evan Vucci/The Associated Press)\n\nAn expert who supports Trump's tariff policies says he's not sure this will affect nations with free-trade deals; he suspects it probably will, but adds that Trump is attempting to do something unprecedented under modern law.\n\n\"There's literally no precedent,\" said Charles Benoit, a Canadian-born, U.S.-based trade lawyer with Coalition For A Prosperous America, a pro-domestic manufacturing group .\n\nHe expects Trump would invoke the Trade Act of 1974 . Its section 122 allows a president to set a maximum 15 per cent tariff, for up to 150 days, in the event of a balance-of-payments deficit with other nations, which the U.S. consistently has.\n\nHe says Trump could then try extending it, again and again, every 150 days. This would certainly trigger lawsuits, as the law says extending it requires an act of Congress.\n\nBenoit's advice: Let it lapse for a day, then keep reimposing the tariffs every 151 days.\n\n\"I think that that's something that the president could do. Just do it \u2014 [and] do it a second time after letting it lapse,\" he said in an interview.\n\nWATCH | U.S. and Canadian economies 'more integrated now than ever,' minister says: Economies of Canada and U.S. 'more integrated now than ever': Champagne Duration 9:46 Despite looming threats to Canada-U.S. trade relations from presidential candidate Donald Trump, 'Team Canada' is confident American industry leaders know that Canada is 'essential' to economic growth in North America, says Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne.\n\nOne of Washington's best-known trade-policy experts over several decades says such behaviour would make a mockery of the language in the bill.\n\nIt would be challenged in court, Gary Hufbauer said. Meanwhile, countries would launch retaliatory tariffs.\n\nAs for Canada, here's his prediction: The northern neighbour will get an exclusion, as would Mexico. But it won't come for free.\n\nHe expects Trump to use the threat as a negotiating ploy \u2014 a stick to threaten Canada and Mexico into making concessions.\n\n\"He will bargain \u2014 to get something for that exclusion,\" Hufbauer said, noting that when it comes to Trump, \"[It's] all transactional.\"\n\nAs for what Trump might ask for, he's already complained, as has the Biden administration , about the way Canada has implemented certain aspects of the new NAFTA. Specifically, dairy and autos.\n\n\"Dairy comes up right away,\" Hufbauer predicted.\n\nParsing the words of Trump's trade czar\n\nOne thing Trump has already succeeded at doing is reorienting the American political consensus on trade.\n\nThe current Biden administration has maintained most of his policies. The two presidents may differ in style, but they agree substantively on trade.\n\nThat philosophy has been articulated at length by Trump's former trade minister. In his book and several magazine pieces , Robert Lighthizer has laid out some of the tariff policies Trump is now running on.\n\nTrump's former trade minister Robert Lighthizer, seen here in 2020, remains influential. He has advocated for these tariffs and argued in detail for why the U.S. needs tougher trade policy. (Andrew Harnik/Reuters)\n\nLighthizer remains in the picture: He's advising the Trump campaign, and recently said publicly that he intends to be involved in the next administration if Trump wins; either serving in an official role, or as an outside adviser.\n\nHis basic argument is that globalization has impoverished the U.S. working class; made the country incapable of producing vital goods; lost manufacturing industries that drive innovation; and left it dependent on a potential military rival (China) for basic everyday products.\n\nHe has little patience for people who call the United States protectionist, when it has among the lowest tariffs in the world.\n\nAnd when it comes to Canada, Lighthizer's book takes the country to task for seeing itself as a free trader, then adopting \"parochial\" and \"protectionist\" policies around everything from dairy to television to telecoms.\n\nHe said tariffs on Canadian and Mexican steel were useful; Trump imposed them, then lifted them, and threatened to reimpose them.\n\n\"The fact that President Trump was willing to impose tariffs on two of America's closest trading partners \u2014 one of whom, Canada, is also one of our closest allies \u2014 sent an unmistakable signal that business as usual was over,\" Lighthizer wrote in his book, No Trade Is Free.\n\nWATCH | Canada and Mexico win first test of new NAFTA: Canada, Mexico defeat U.S. in auto part rules dispute Duration 1:31 Mexico and Canada have won a trade dispute with the United States over rules of origin for auto parts, which could help protect Canadian businesses and jobs.\n\nWhat next?\n\nThe tangible effects of Trump's trade policies remain in dispute.\n\nSeveral studies say his tariffs had a minimal positive impact on U.S. jobs , and a minimal harmful impact on the economy and inflation .\n\nOne trade economist and historian says Trump's policies shifted some production from China, primarily to Vietnam and Mexico; meanwhile, China bought more food from Brazil.\n\n\"In the political debate, both the benefits and the costs [of tariffs] tend to get exaggerated,\" said Douglas Irwin of Dartmouth College.\n\nBut what Trump is proposing now is bigger than his first-term tariffs , which the Congressional Budget Office said shaved 0.3 per cent off the U.S. economy.\n\nTrump also wants Congress to pass a law that would allow reciprocal tariffs \u2014 massive duties on countries with high tariffs, like India and China.\n\nTrump touts his tariffs on washing machines at an Ohio Whirlpool plant in 2020. A study by economists at the U.S. Federal Reserve says those tariffs created 1,800 jobs, but raised prices on washing machines by about $90. It's an example of how tariffs had small effects, both positive and negative. (Joshua Roberts/Reuters)\n\nIrwin says the real risk is that in the long term, Trump's policies could trigger a domino effect, toppling the rules-based trading system, making commerce more political and less predictable and leading to tit-for-tat retaliation. He says countries that rely most heavily on the U.S. for trade are the most vulnerable.\n\n\"You're right to be worried in Canada.\"\n\nBenoit takes the opposite view. If Trump managed to enact his entire agenda, with the biggest tariffs on Asia, he says Canada would enjoy a renaissance in manufacturing .\n\nInstead of reflexively opposing some of these policies, he says Canada should offer to team up with Trump to impose similar tariffs against China.\n\n\"Canada should say: 'We're with you. We're walking shoulder to shoulder with you,' \" Benoit said.",

        "text": "Deepfakes in the 2024 US Presidential Election\nPSA\n\nMarch 23, 2024 | manipulated video\n\n\n\ncontent: To raise awareness of the potential danger of deepfakes, the Arizona Agenda created a deepfake of Senate candidate Kari Lake. The deepfake Lake is made to reveal she is a deepfake. The creators write: \"Welcome to the terrifying new age of artificial intelligence deepfakes. It\u2019s only beginning. The 2024 election is going to be the first in history where any idiot with a computer can create convincing videos depicting fake events of global importance and publish them to the world in a matter of minutes. Including us.\"\n\n\n\nanalysis: The content is clearly labeled as AI generated.\n\n\n\nfact check: Arizona Agenda\n\nBiden on Kyiv\n\nMarch 22, 2024 | manipulated video\n\n\n\ncontent: Posted on twitter.com by an account with a track record of spreading disinformation, this video purports to show President Biden erroneously saying Russia has occupied Kyiv for 10 years (Russia invidated Crimea in 2014, not Kyiv).\n\n\n\nanalysis: Our analysis of the audio using a model trained to distinguish real from AI-generated speech confidently classifies the audio as AI-generated. Our analysis of the video with a second model trained to detect inconsistencies between the mouth movement and spoken words also reveals evidence that this video is a lip-sync deepfake in which President Biden's mouth has been synthesized to be consistent with the AI-generated voice.\n\n\n\nfact check: AFP\n\nTrump and Black Voters\n\nMarch 4, 2024 | manipulated image\n\n\n\ncontent: In a repeat of the February 1, 2024 entry below, a new batch of fake photos purportedly showing Donald Trump with Black voters continue to circulate on social media in, it would seem, an attempt to court Black voters.\n\n\n\nanalysis: Our analysis has detected patterns in this image that are consistent with the generative-AI service Midjourney. In addition, it has been reported by the BBC that one photo was created by the Florida-based conservative radio show host Mark Kaye. \u201cI'm not out there taking pictures of what\u2019s really happening. I\u2019m a storyteller,\u201d Kaye told BBC. \u201cI\u2019m not claiming it is accurate. I\u2019m not saying, \u2018Hey, look, Donald Trump was at this party with all of these African American voters. Look how much they love him.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nfact check: BBC\n\nFred Trump\n\nFebruary 18, 2024 | manipulated video\n\n\n\ncontent: On the heals of Donald Trump accusing some in the media of using AI to create unflattering footage of him, the Lincoln Project (a centrist PAC), released an AI-generated video of Trump's father, Fred Trump saying things like \"Everyone knows why the women leave you, you're boring, broke, and I told you not to get fat. You pay porn stars and you are weak down there. Your kids hate you, especially the girl. How did a son of mine turn out so damn dumb? The brand I built is crap because of you. You're trash. You'll be lucky to stay out of jail.\"\n\n\n\nanalysis: The video contains the disclosure \"This video has been manipulated by technical means and depicts speech or conduct that did not occur.\"\n\n\n\nfact check: Futurism\n\nTrump's Bloody Hand\n\nFebruary 1, 2024 | photo in question\n\n\n\ncontent: As Trump was leaving an event on Jan. 17th of this year, he waved to reporters. The video shows what appears to be bruises/blood on his right hand. When he was asked later by Fox News reporter Mark Meredith \u201cHow\u2019s your hand? It looks better now,\u201d Trump responded \"My hand?\" After some back and forth Trump responded \"Nothing. Maybe it was AI.\"\n\n\n\nanalysis: Because this photo was taken from a longer video, throughout which the bruises are visible, it is unlikely that this is an AI-generated photo or a more traditionally manipulated photo. In addition, our model trained to distinguish real from AI-generated images classifies this image as unlikely to be AI-generated. This may be an example of the liar's dividend where in the age of deepfakes it is has become increasingly easier to claim that something is fake.\n\n\n\nfact check: The Hill\n\nRepublican Victory in 2024\n\nFebruary 1, 2024 | manipulated images [ 1 | 2 ]\n\n\n\ncontent: Posted on twitter.com by Patrick Ruffini and racking up over 2 million views, these images were accompanied with the tweet \"Republican victory in 2024 depends on their being able to do this.\"\n\n\n\nanalysis: These images are AI-generated. The man on the right in the first image has three arms and the text on the hat and shirt are gibberish -- common artifacts of today's generative AI. Similarly, the text in the second image is gibberish, and the American flag in the foreground appears to have only one star. In addition, our model trained to distinguish real from AI-generated images classifies these images as highly likely to be AI-generated.\n\n\n\nfact check: this one is easy\n\nBiden in Fatigues\n\nJanuary 30, 2024 | manipulated images [ 1 | 2 | 3 ]\n\n\n\ncontent: A series of photos circulated on twitter.com purportedly showing President Biden in military fatigues on the verge of authorizing military strikes.\n\n\n\nanalysis: The image is AI-generated. There are tell-tale signs of misinformed objects on the table, and our geometric analysis of the ceiling tiles reveals a physically inconsistent vanishing point.\n\n\n\nfact check: AFP Fact Check\n\nWhat a Bunch of Malarkey\n\nJanuary 22, 2024 | manipulated audio\n\n\n\ncontent: In the lead up to the New Hampshire Democratic primary, voters in the state received robocalls impersonating President Biden. The call urged voters not to vote in the primary and to \"save your vote for the November election.\" The call went on to say \"voting this Tuesday only enables the Republicans in their quest to elect Donald Trump again. Your vote makes a difference in November, not this Tuesday.\" It is currently unclear who is behind these calls.\n\n\n\nanalysis: The quality of the deepfake voice is quite low and it is fairly clear from the voice and cadence that it is AI-generated. In addition, our models, trained to distinguish real from fake audio, classifies, with high confidence, this audio has AI-generated.\n\n\n\nfact check: NBC News\n\n\n\nupdate: New Hampshire Attorney General John Formella announced on Feb 6, 2024 that his office has identified two businesses beind these robocalls, Life Corporation and Lingo Telecom. Formella said \"We have issued a cease-and-desist letter to Life Corporation that orders the company to immediately desist violating New Hampshire election laws. We have also opened a criminal investigation, and we are taking next steps in that investigation, sending document preservation notices and subpoenas to Life Corporation, Lingo Telecom, and any other individual or entity\" [source]\n\nAn AI-generated Rep. Dean Phillips\n\nJanuary 18, 2024 | manipulated audio\n\n\n\ncontent: A super PAC supporting Rep. Dean Phillips' campaign created an interactive AI-powered version of Rep. Phillips. The bot was powered by OpenAI's ChatGPT and AI-powered voice cloning/synthesis. OpenAI forbids the use of its tools in political campaigns and shortly after the bot's release, OpenAI suspsended the creator's account. This is not the first AI-powered candidate; A similar interactive AI-bot was created of Mayor Suarez (see July 8, 2023 entry below).\n\n\n\nanalysis: The bot creators and the bot itself acknowledge it is AI-generated.\n\n\n\nfact check: Washington Post and Washington Post\n\nBiden Sending F15s to Texas\n\nJanuary 13, 2024 | manipulated audio\n\n\n\ncontent: As tensions flared between Texas and the US Government over access to the U.S.-Mexico border, this audio spread across TikTok claiming to be President Biden saying \"We\u2019re going to make sure those cowboys don\u2019t stop the surge of military-age men from entering. If we have to send F-15s to Texas here and wage war against Texas, so be it.\" Similar videos spread on twitter.com.\n\n\n\nanalysis: The White House claims the audio is fake, and there is no public record of President Biden saying anything to this effect. The audio has tell-tale signs of being AI-generated in terms of the cadence of the speech.\n\n\n\nfact check: PolitiFact\n\nTrump and Epstein\n\nJanuary 4, 2024 | manipulated image\n\n\n\ncontent: Shortly after a Judge unsealed documents in the case of convicted child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein (who died in jail in 2019), this photo began circulated on twitter.com before circulated more broadly on various other platforms. The photo purports to show Donald Trump, Epstein and a young girl.\n\n\n\nanalysis: There are many tell-tale signs that this is an AI-generated photo, including the distorted fingers of the young girl as well as the distorted faces of the people in the background. In addition, our model trained to distinguish real from AI-generated images classifies this image as highly likely to be AI-generated.\n\n\n\nfact check: Snopes.com\n\nWhat Ron DeSantis Should Say But Won't\n\nSeptember 1, 2023 | manipulated video\n\n\n\ncontent: YouTube creator C3PMeme made this video of Ron DeSantis saying, in part, \"I've realized that I need to drop out of this race immediately. I was told I could be President by some very powerful people and I took some very bad advice... I never should have challenged President Trump, the greatest president of my life time... It's time to right this ship and help President Trump get reelected to make America great again.\"\n\n\n\nanalysis: From the fairly crude mouth motion and audio quality to the video description \"A deepfake of what Ron DeSantis might say if he dropped out of the race (which he should)\", this video is obviously a fake and was not created to be deceptive. Based on our forensic analysis, we find that the voice in this video is highly likely to be AI-generated.\n\n\n\nfact check: Forbes\n\nTrump Attacks Iowa\n\nJuly 17, 2023 | manipulated video\n\n\n\ncontent: A PAC supporting Ron DeSantis created an ad attacking former President Donald Trump. The ad takes issue with Trump's attack on Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds. In the video ad, we hear Trump's voice criticizing Reynolds. The text appears to be based on a post by Trump on Truth Social. The ad is scheduled to run in Iowa with at least a $1 million ad buy.\n\n\n\nanalysis: A person familiar with the ad confirmed that Trump's voice was AI generated.\n\n\n\nfact check: Politico | PolitiFact\n\nAsk AI Suarez\n\nJuly 8, 2023 | Ask AI Suarez\n\n\n\ncontent: A super PAC supporting Miami Mayor Francis Suarez's presidential run launched an interactive AI chatbot to engage with voters. Suarez's campaign denies being involved in creating this AI bot or what their PAC does.\n\n\n\nanalysis: The content is clearly labeled as AI generated. It appears that the bot mostly listens to a user's question and then directs them to a relevant stock video response.\n\n\n\nfact check: AP News\n\nTrump or Biden 2024\n\nJuly 8, 2023 | manipulated video\n\n\n\ncontent: AI-generated versions of Donald Trump and Joe Biden engaged in a user-prompted debate is streaming 24/7 on Twitch. The content is often riddled with offensive language and appears to be powered by a chatGPT-like language model for crafting the script, voice cloning, and a lip-sync video manipulation.\n\n\n\nanalysis: The content is clearly labeled as AI generated and parody.\n\nTrump Dancing with Young Girl\n\nJune 14, 2023 | manipulated image\n\n\n\ncontent: An image purportedly showing Donald Trump dancing with a young girl spread on Twitter and TikTok. This image was not associated with a political advertisement.\n\n\n\nanalysis: The image contains physical inconsistencies consistent with AI generation including a misformed hand of the man in the background with six fingers grasping a glass of beer. The girl's left eye contains a specular reflection consistent with, for example, a camera flash, but her right eye improbably does not contain the same reflection.\n\n\n\nTrump's campaign accused the DeSantis campaign which has previously created fake images of Trump (see below). The DeSantis campaign denied the allegation.\n\n\n\nfact check: Newsweek | AP News\n\nLeaked Trump Tape\n\nJune 11, 2023 | manipulated audio\n\n\n\ncontent: This audio was created by Matthew Ellis with full disclosure that it is a deepfake. The description on YouTube reads \"This is a DEEP FAKE. The purpose of this video it is to illustrate the severity of Trump's actions listed in the Indictment and to show how AI and Fake Audio/Video recordings need to be flagged by Platforms and Content Creators.\"\n\n\n\nanalysis: This audio is clearly labeled as a deepfake. It is included here to show the quality of AI-cloned voices.\n\n\n\nfact check:\n\nDeSantis Campaign Ad\n\nJune 7, 2023 | manipulated images [00:24-00:30 sec]\n\n\n\ncontent: A DeSantis campaign video was releaased attacking Donald Trump by showing, in part, a montage of photos of Trump embracing Dr. Fauci.\n\n\n\nanalysis: Three of the photos in the six-photo montage (top-left, bottom-center, and bottom-right) show clear signs of AI-generatation. Each of these images contain physical inconsistencies including: the text on the White House logo is nonsensical (top-left), the stars on the flag are misshapen (bottom-center), and the shape of Trump's ear is inconsistent with reference images (bottom-right).\n\n\n\nfact check: Agence France-Presse (AFP)\n\nDeSantis and Musk on Twitter\n\nMay 23, 2023 | manipulated audio\n\n\n\ncontent: Former President Donald Trump released an AI-generated clip of a fake Twitter Spaces event consisting of a conversation between Elon Musk, George Soros, Klaus Schwab, an incessantly coughing Dick Cheney, Satan, and Adolf Hitler. This clip was released after the glitchy Twitter Spaces launch of DeSantis' presidential announcement.\n\n\n\nanalysis: The addition of Hitler and The Devil makes it obvious that this audio is fake.\n\n\n\nfact check: Gizmodo\n\nHarris Rambling Speech\n\nMay 4, 2023 | manipulated video\n\n\n\ncontent: A recorded speech originally given by Vice President Harris on April 25, 2023 at Howard University was digitally altered to replace the original voice track with a seemingly inebriated and rambling voice saying \"Today is today, and yesterday was today yesterday, tomorrow will be today tomorrow so live today so the future today will be as the past today as it is tomorrow.\"\n\n\n\nanalysis: There are clear signs of audio/video misalignment. The original video was eventually released showing the same clothing and background, and the impersonated audio was traced back to a TikTok user @mommyrn88. It is not entirely clear if this is a lipsync deepfake or just a classic audio/video dubbing.\n\n\n\nfact check: Reuters\n\nRNC's Biden Ad\n\nApril 25, 2023 | manipulated video\n\n\n\ncontent: Shortly after President Biden announced his bid for reelection, the Republican National Committee (RNC) released a video ad featuring a series of fake images. The video imagines \"what if crimes worsens,\" \"what if international tensions escalate,\" and \"what if the financial system crumbles,\" each with an associated fake image showing the corresponding apocalyptic future.\n\n\n\nanalysis: A small disclaimer in the top left of the frame says \"built entirely with AI imagery,\" and the caption underneath the YouTube video reads, \"An AI-generated look into the country's possible future if Joe Biden is re-elected in 2024.\"\n\n\n\nfact check: The Verge\n\nTrump Praying\n\nMarch 24, 2023 | manipulated image\n\n\n\ncontent: Weeks before the first indictment of former President Donald Trump, a series of fake images circulated online showing his arrest. In response, Trump shared his own fake image on Truth Social showing him kneeling in prayer.\n\n\n\nanalysis: Initial versions of AI-generated images struggled to create realistic and physically consistent hands. In this image, Trump's fingers are misformed. The faces of the men in the background are also highly distorted, consistent with physical inconsistencies made by generative AI systems.\n\n\n\nfact check: BBC\n\nBiden on Banking Turmoil\n\nMarch 15, 2023 | manipulated audio\n\n\n\ncontent: Following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and the resulting financial instability, an audio clip purportedly of President Biden was released in which he is heard saying, in part, \"all the money is gone\" and \"a collapse is imminent.\"\n\n\n\nanalysis: When separated from the recording, the background noise has a highly regular pattern that appears to be synthetic and not the result of a physically noisy system. The cadence of the speech is highly regular, consistent with synthetically-generated speech and atypical of natural speech.\n\n\n\nfact check: Associated Press",

        "text": "Immigration policy and the 2024 presidential election\nAs the 2024 U.S. presidential election kicks into gear, an issue already taking center stage both among candidates and the electorate is immigration. Immigration has been front-page news, from dramatic scenes along the border to the State of the Union address to a Texas migrant law playing out in the courts.\n\n\u201cImmigration is such a central theme in both campaigns. At the same time, all the media attention goes to the so-called \u2018border crisis\u2019 that we\u2019ve been hearing about nonstop for three years,\u201d says Chenoa Flippen, sociologist and director of the Center for the Study of Ethnicity, Race, and Immigration (CSERI). \u201cSo much so that there is a lot less attention to other really important things that the Biden administration has been doing.\u201d\n\nAn April 2 symposium, co-sponsored by the Penn Migration Initiative, Population Studies Center, and CSERI, aims to shed light on other important aspects of immigration policy. The symposium will bring together policy analysts, immigration scholars, and representatives of nonprofit advocacy organizations to discuss immigration policies and their impact, as well as the role of academic research in informing the broader debate.\n\nMuch of today\u2019s immigration policy has been shaped by congressional gridlock and the increased role of the executive branch in shaping the country\u2019s immigration agenda, Flippen says. In President Biden\u2019s first three years, he signed more than 535 immigration-related executive actions.\n\n\u201cWe hope to move away from all the hype and media frenzy over the border and examine what the Biden administration has actually done. To what extent are his policies a break from the past versus a continuation of prior administrations? Over 500 executive actions is a lot to keep track of,\u201d says Flippen. \u201cWe also want to understand the community impact of those changes.\u201d\n\nThe first panel, moderated by political science professor Michael Jones-Correa, will look at contemporary immigration policy and the role of immigration in America\u2019s future. It will offer a bird\u2019s eye view of the Biden administration\u2019s policies, the current debate, and what immigration policy might look like under different scenarios. Speakers include Ariel Ruiz, senior policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute; Dara Lind, senior fellow at the American Immigration Council; and Angela Kelley of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.\n\nThe second panel, moderated by Penn Carey Law\u2019s Fernando Chang-Muy, will feature Sarah Paoletti, law professor and director of Penn Carey Law\u2019s Transnational Legal Clinic; as well as Margie McHugh, director of the National Center on Immigration Integration Policy; and Erin Argueta, Senior Lead Attorney at the Southern Poverty Law Center. The panel will examine the impact of Biden\u2019s immigration policies and enforcement and will shed light on how current policies are experienced by local communities and institutions.\n\n\u201cWe really want to provide a much more comprehensive, complex view of what\u2019s happening on the immigration stage than people get in their news feeds,\u201d Flippen says. \u201cThis is a continuation of decades-long policies, and this is an incredibly complex issue. We need to understand it in a broader context.\u201d\n\nAmanda Pinheiro, a postdoctoral fellow at Perry World House, is one of the co-organizers of the symposium. Her research \u201cinvestigates the human cost of racially charged migration deterrence policies and practices in the Americas, foregrounding race in global migration research and policymaking.\u201d\n\nThere are very new dynamics in terms of asylum seekers at the U.S.-Mexico border, she says, from Venezuelans and Ukrainians to people from Afghanistan and Pakistan. Last year, at the treacherous Darien Gap, more than half a million migrants crossed from Colombia to Panama.\n\n\u201cWe have migrants from Afghanistan going all the way to Brazil and crossing 11 countries. These are unprecedented dynamics across the Americas,\u201d says Pinheiro.\n\nShe says it\u2019s important to pay attention to these dynamics in global migration, and she hopes the symposium sheds some light on how these migratory movements are shaping politics and how politics are shaping those movements.\n\n\u201cThis issue will have a great impact on the outcome of these U.S. elections. We need to look at its political importance, but also we have to pay attention to what\u2019s happening in this country from the perspective of the migrant,\u201d she says.\n\nEstefan\u00eda Casta\u00f1eda-P\u00e9rez, a postdoctoral fellow at the Penn Migration Initiative conducting research on the consequences of border policing and immigration laws, is one of the co-organizers of the symposium. She says it\u2019s important to center dignity and human rights protections when looking at immigration issues.\n\n\u201cThe U.S.-Mexico border is often portrayed as a zone in perpetual crisis, which serves to increase support for stepped-up militarization at the cost of human rights protections,\u201d she says. \u201cYet, the dangers that migrants experience are often minimized. We hope that audience members will get a greater understanding of the realities and challenges facing migrants and their advocates as they seek to address border violence from the perspectives of academic scholarship, advocacy, and policy.\u201d\n\nRegistration information for the symposium can be found on the Center for the Study of Ethnicity, Race, and Immigration\u2019s website: https://cseri.sas.upenn.edu/events/2024/04/02/symposium-immigration-policy-and-2024-election",

        "text": "Issues and Trends in U.S. Presidential Election 2024\nThe U.S. presidential election, like national elections in most democracies, is mostly fought and won on domestic issues that have a direct bearing on the day-to-day lives of the American people. Foreign policy issues, while still significant for a global power like the United States, is largely peripheral and episodic in terms of influencing voting patterns. Nevertheless, more than any other election in the world, the process and result of the U.S. presidential election is keenly watched and has global repercussions. From the intra-party primaries to the presidential nominations, and then to the final verdict in November, candidates will have to grapple with a host of issues, based on which American voters will elect the next U.S. president. As the election season heats up, candidates will become more hyperbolic in asserting their best plans to save American democracy at home, and American leadership abroad. An assessment of the major domestic and foreign policy issues dominating the hearts and minds of American voters is, therefore, imperative.",

        "text": "Wisconsin\u2019s New Regulation of AI and Deepfakes in Political Communications\nAs the capabilities of generative artificial intelligence have increased, so have concerns that generative AI might be used to manipulate voters and the administration of elections in the 2024 presidential election and primaries. The first warning shot came in New Hampshire on January 21, 2024, two days before the New Hampshire Presidential Primary Election, when numerous New Hampshire residents received robocalls that played a message with what appeared to be an AI-generated voice clone of President Joe Biden\u2019s voice, encouraging recipients not to vote in the January 23, 2024 primary. The \u201cdeepfake\u201d simulated voice of President Biden urged residents to \u201csave\u201d their vote for the November 2024 U.S. Presidential Election.\n\nWithin days, the New Hampshire Attorney General\u2019s Office Election Law Unit launched an investigation into these calls in coordination with state and federal partners, including the Anti-Robocall Multistate Litigation Task Force, which is a bipartisan task force made up of 50 state attorneys general, and the Federal Communications Commission Enforcement Bureau.[1] In addition, the League of Women Voters of New Hampshire, the League of Women Voters of the United States, and several individuals have filed a civil lawsuit in federal court in New Hampshire alleging claims under Section 11(b) of the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965, the federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act, and the New Hampshire Election Laws for the unlawful infringement of voting rights and the distribution of unlawful robocalls.[2]\n\nIn November 2023, proposed legislation (2023 Assembly Bill 664) was introduced in the Wisconsin Assembly to regulate the use of deepfakes in Wisconsin\u2019s elections.\n\nSummary of the new Wisconsin law on synthetic media in political communications\n\nOn March 21, 2024, Governor Tony Evers signed a new law, 2023 Wisconsin Act 123,[3] which regulates the use of synthetic media in audio and video political communications. The law requires that any audio or video communication make certain disclosures if the communication: (1) is paid for by a candidate committee, legislative campaign committee, political action committee, independent expenditure committee, political party, recall committee, or referendum committee with a contribution or disbursement; (2) contains synthetic media; and (3) contains express advocacy (as defined under current law), issue advocacy, or supports or opposes a referendum. The law defines \u201csynthetic media\u201d as audio or video content substantially produced by means of generative artificial intelligence. Wis. Stat. \u00a7 11.1303(2m)(a)2. The law defines \u201cissue advocacy\u201d as a communication that provides information about political or social issues and is made to influence the outcome of an election. Wis. Stat. \u00a7 11.1303(2m)(a)1.\n\nUnder the law, every such audio communication must include at both the beginning and the end of the communication the words \u201cContains content generated by AI.\u201d Wis. Stat. \u00a7 11.1303(2m)(b).\n\nThe law provides that every such video communication must include throughout the duration of each portion of the communication containing synthetic media, in writing that is readable, legible, and readily accessible, the words \u201cThis video content generated by AI\u201d if the video includes video synthetic media only, \u201cThis audio content generated by AI\u201d if the video includes audio synthetic media only, or \u201cThis content generated by AI\u201d if the video includes both video and audio synthetic media. Wis. Stat. \u00a7 11.1303(2m)(c).\n\nThe law imposes a forfeiture of up to $1,000 for each violation of the law\u2019s requirements, enforced in the same manner as other similar violations of Wisconsin\u2019s laws regulating campaigns (Wis. Stat. \u00a7 11.1303(2m)(f)), and authorizes the Ethics Commission to adopt rules creating limited exceptions to the bill\u2019s disclosure requirements (Wis. Stat. \u00a7 11.1303(2m)(d)). Compliance with the new law does not create an exemption from any civil or criminal liability, including for violations of Wis. Stat. \u00a7 12.05 (prohibiting false statements affecting elections). Wis. Stat. \u00a7 11.1303(2m)(e).\n\nFinally, the law specifies that no liability for a violation of the law\u2019s disclosure requirements shall attach to a broadcaster or other host or carrier of a video or audio communication and that the law may not be construed to alter or negate any rights, obligations, or immunities of a computer service or Internet access provider under federal law.\n\nWho is regulated? Committees, not individuals, corporations, or social media platforms.\n\nWisconsin\u2019s approach to regulating synthetic media in audio and video political communications focuses on certain communications paid for by contributions to, or disbursements by committees as defined by Wis. Stat. \u00a7 11.0101(6). The new law also immunizes social media platforms from liability for a violation of the law\u2019s disclosure requirement. Wis. Stat. \u00a7 11.1303(2m)(g). If, for example, a candidate committee posts a deepfake on an online platform, the platform cannot be held liable for hosting even though the candidate committee could be.\n\nWhat is regulated? Audio and visual deepfakes, not cheapfakes.\n\nThe new law covers only audio and video synthetic media\u2014sometimes called deepfakes\u2014that is, digital audio or video created using an editing process that is automated through generative artificial intelligence (GAI) techniques. Regulated deepfakes might, for example, depict a real candidate or politician saying something they did not say or an entirely fake person. The law does not regulate manipulated media\u2014sometimes called cheapfakes or shallowfakes. Manipulated media can be as simple as mislabeling videos, or audio clips to imply they are from a different time or location, or editing a piece of media to make it look like something happened that did not. The new law also does not regulate the use of deepfake photos.\n\nHow are deepfakes regulated? The disclosure requirement.\n\nThe new law requires disclosure that certain communications contain synthetic media; it does not ban such communications.\n\nStafford Rosenbaum LLP\u2019s Election and Political Law Practice attorneys continue to monitor ongoing efforts to regulate AI in political advertising at the federal, state, and industry levels.

        "text": "AI, lies and conspiracy theories: How Latinos became a key target for misinformation in the US election\nIs Taylor Swift a Pentagon psychological operations asset? Did Texas governor Greg Abbott say that Joe Biden needs to learn from Vladimir Putin to work for the interest of the United States? Did Donald Trump say that the 9/11 attacks were an inside job of the US government? Has the US military arrived in Ecuador to \u2018kill terrorists\u2019?\n\nIf you scroll through Spanish-language TikTok, X, and Facebook, you may have seen some of these falsehoods that aim to negatively portray Democrats or Republicans, depending on which fake news you encounter.\n\nUS voters will head to the polls on 5 November in the first presidential election since the rise of generative AI. Audiences might be exposed to audio, images and videos created with Midjourney, Dall-E, ChatGPT and other tools. But they will definitely encounter more traditional forms of misinformation, which tend to be based on true information that\u2019s spun, twisted, recontextualised, or reworked by activists and campaigners with the goal of reinforcing partisan narratives, just as the stories above show.\n\nThroughout the past couple of decades, US Latinos have been the target for these kinds of mis- and disinformation campaigns. With an estimated 36.2 million of Latinos being eligible to vote in 2024, up from 32.3 million in 2020, they make up the biggest minority group in the country with a significant say on its future, as many live in battleground states such as Florida, Arizona, Nevada, and Georgia.\n\nTo understand what narratives are being disseminated to Spanish-speakers in the US, I spoke to three experts who are tracking them and fact-checking them to Spanish-speaking audiences.\n\nLee este art\u00edculo en espa\u00f1ol\n\nHow Latinos are targeted\n\nTamoa Calzadilla is the editor-in-chief of Factchequado, a digital fact-checking outlet focusing on disinformation in Spanish in the United States. She stresses that US Latinos are not a monolith voting group and explains that different narratives target different communities depending on where you come from.\n\n\u201cI live here in a community in Miami with many Venezuelans and many Cubans who are afraid of dictatorships and socialism. Some conspiracy groups know this and then they use it to scare people,\u201d Calzadilla says.\n\nA good example is a YouTube campaign ad that the Trump campaign created in 2020 falsely claiming that the Venezuelan government supported Joe Biden. According to nonprofit newsroom ProPublica, the video was watched more than 100,000 times in Florida in the nine days leading up to the 2020 presidential election. Venezuelan president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro didn\u2019t endorse any of the candidates. But some voters may have believed what they saw.\n\nOther narratives that prey on Latino communities have to do with inflation (targeted at Argentinians and Venezuelans), abortion and reproductive rights (most Latin Americans are Catholic), and the shadow of electoral fraud or rigged elections (something that has happened in the past in Honduras, Nicaragua, Ecuador, and many other countries).\n\n\u201cThis kind of disinformation is targeted at the Latino community who don\u2019t speak English,\u201d says Calzadilla. \u201cWe understand that Spanish speakers in the United States are more vulnerable than others because they do not have the same sources [as English speakers] to inform themselves.\u201d\n\nWhile many young Latinos consume news in English, over 15 million American households are Spanish-speaking, and at least three million of those households are \u201climited English speaking,\u201d according to the Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey. This means that a significant portion of the Latino population in the US consumes Spanish-language content.\n\nSam Woolley, director of the propaganda research lab at the Center for Media Engagement at the University of Texas, has also seen these narratives adapt towards particular populations. The Center, which has worked with multiple and diverse Latino communities across the US, looks at how this segment of the population is exposed to manipulative content.\n\n\u201cOne critical thing to understand is that a lot of the campaigns we see are micro-targeted at specific subsections of the Latino population in specific geographies and they speak about issues that are specifically relevant to those communities,\u201d he explains.\n\nSome narratives, however, transcend sub-communities to target the wider Spanish-speaking electorate. According to Calzadilla, one of the most prominent ones is the alleged electoral fraud in 2020 and the so-called illegal migrant invasion. Ronny Rojas who leads Tverifica, Telemundo\u2019s fact-checking initiative, agrees and says he\u2019s often seen immigration messages, including some using false or misleading data to draw a link between increased immigration and criminality. While a number of Latinos in the US are immigrants themselves or come from immigrant families, many of them oppose what they see as the onslaught of illegal immigration coming from the southern border. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of rejection from at least a part of the Latino community towards this type of migration,\u201d he explains. \u201cWe are seeing that now because the issue of migration has become a central point in this campaign.\u201d\n\nHe speculates that these narratives are not just created to persuade voters but to create confusion amongst them. \u201cBy generating more confusion, it adds to the discussions about immigration,\u201d Rojas says. \u201cThe strongest narratives in the last few years are that migrants exploit the benefits system, which is not the case.\u201d\n\nWho spreads these false narratives?\n\nAs the Republican primary was starting to heat up in 2023, Ron DeSantis\u2019 campaign shared a video criticising Trump for not firing Anthony Fauci from his role in the COVID-19 taskforce. The video included fake AI-generated images of Trump hugging and kissing Fauci. While this example and the one above connecting Maduro to Biden come directly from the Republican camp, can we say that Republicans are more likely to spread disinformation to Latinos than Democrats? Not necessarily, but it manifests in different ways, Caldazilla says.\n\n\u201cSome conservative media outlets and radio stations in Miami spread conspiracy theories like the great replacement theory that says there is a plot to bring immigrants to vote and the \u2018big lie\u2019 [saying Trump won the 2020 election],\u201d she says. \u201c[Democrats] exaggerate how successful their administration is, but we are not seeing a lot of use of artificial intelligence to deceive people about a specific conspiracy theory.\u201d She says that Democrats are more likely to omit information that makes them look bad or inflate figures that make them look good, whereas Republicans are more likely to reference conspiracy theories.\n\nWoolley agrees that both parties are leveraging different tactics on social media to try to manipulate public opinion. He further explains the Democrats\u2019 general strategy, which involves the use of coordinated groups of political influencers who are paid to riff off a script without any disclosures. While Republicans also employ coordinated influencer campaigns, they are more willing to use botnets and disinformation to sway people\u2019s perspectives.\n\nWhile the origin of some of these lies is easy to track as they come from candidates themselves, most of the time it\u2019s not so cut and dry. Woolley says that campaigns often engage in what he calls \u2018identity laundering\u2019, with shadowy marketing firms often purposely created to just work during one election in one state for a specific campaign.\n\n\u201cIt is important for people to understand that it's often intermediaries and consulting groups that are doing this work,\u201d Woolley explains. \u201cThe United States still has several loopholes that allow campaigns to hire contractors, but then the contractors can hire subcontractors that can avoid having to list themselves as having worked for a political campaign.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s new in the age of AI?\n\nWoolley and his colleagues at the Center for Media Engagement have been tracking what they call computational propaganda (bots, algorithms and other forms of automation) since 2012. While the bot driven disinformation campaigns they saw in 2016 were rudimentary and repetitive, they still managed to manipulate algorithms and spread false and harmful content during the campaign.\n\n\u201cWhat generative AI does is putting computational propaganda on steroids,\u201d Woolley says. \u201cWith generative AI, campaigns are not only amplified to a higher degree. They're also much more persuasive, and much more nuanced.\u201d\n\nWhat does Woolley mean by this? As a social scientist who has studied computational manipulation in the political sphere for years, he often has trouble identifying images that have been doctored by AI. \u201cIf experts cannot distinguish between AI-created content, whether it's images, text, videos, and non-generic content, then what hope do regular voters have?\u201d he says.\n\nOne of the fact-checking initiatives from Telemundo\u2019s Tverifica is a WhatsApp channel where they can communicate directly with their audience. This service also allows users to send the team story ideas, and images and documents they want them to verify.\n\nRojas says that most of the content they are seeing being circulated are images generated by AI, an issue that did not exist in previous election cycles. \u201cYou see all kinds of things,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are images of politicians that you see in circumstances or in situations that did not occur, but I would not stop only at politics. In fact, images of all kinds are circulating massively.\u201d\n\nAn example Rojas gives is images of a newly discovered species of cat with a vibrant fur pattern that have been shared at least hundreds of times on Facebook and viewed thousands of times on TikTok. While this cat does not exist and its images were generated through AI, thousands of people have shared and commented believing it is real.\n\n\"You can say, 'well, that's a case that doesn't harm anyone' but in reality, if you analyse it, what is generated is a false belief in the existence of a breed of cat that is false and if you start to put together all these false publications, these images that are coming, that people are seeing, suddenly you realise that an important part of the information that people consume is false, it is nonexistent. So, in the end, this generates a false knowledge base,\u201d he says.\n\nAI-generated images are not the only ones making the rounds in the campaign trail. Right before the New Hampshire primary, residents of the state were receiving robocalls that used AI to mimic Biden\u2019s voice to discourage people from voting. Calzadilla says that they are seeing videos on Facebook of a fake Biden speaking Spanish and promoting a false executive order that would give free insurance to people earning less than $50,000.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned about that because now we are facing the first electoral process in the midst of the boom of generative artificial intelligence and I have started to see how electoral campaigns are using AI to deceive people without any transparency on the technology they use,\u201d she says.\n\nIn mid-February, several tech companies, including OpenAI, Meta, Google, TikTok, Microsoft and Amazon, signed a pledge vowing that they would combat the creation and the spread of AI-generated content from interfering with elections across the globe. But their pledge is lacking in details on how they will achieve this goal.\n\nWhat to expect from the election\n\nWith the 2024 election cycle already ramping up, media organisations are preparing for what is coming ahead.\n\nTelemundo is hiring one to two additional fact-checkers as well as establishing strategic alliances with other media organisations. For example, they have partnered with media literacy outfit MediaWise to produce a series of educational videos with Telemundo\u2019s news anchors to help people identify false information.\n\n\u201cWe did a series of videos and a course that people could follow online at their own pace to protect themselves from fake news online,\u201d explains Rojas. They are hoping to produce similar videos for other platforms like TikTok so they can reach other types of audiences.\n\nFactchequeado is building partnerships with media organisations around the country which includes an amalgamation of newspapers, local TV and radio stations, and digital news outlets. These organisations are not only Spanish-language outlets but also English-language outlets aimed at the Hispanic community in the country. This allows them to spread their fact-checking to all corners of the US. These news organisations, including the Dallas Morning News, El Nuevo Georgia News, and Qu\u00e9 Hay De Nuevo New Hampshire, can publish everything they produce free of charge.\n\n\u201cWe started in April 2022, with seven allies in different cities and right now we have more than 60 media outlets,\u201d says Calzadilla. Factchequado, a brainchild born out of a collaboration between Spain\u2019s Maldita.es and Argentina\u2019s Chequeado, gets to fund its team of 14 through a variety of grants from organisations such as Open Society Foundation and Google News Initiative.\n\nWhile the work of these organisations is necessary when it comes to protecting Latino communities from the onslaught of disinformation, there is a limit to what can be done without the input of the platforms where these falsehoods spread. \u201cMany studies show that social media platforms do not, at least here in the US, do the same thorough job in cleaning up misinformation in Spanish as they do in English,\u201d says Rojas. \u201cSo that makes Latinos especially vulnerable to disinformation.\u201d\n\nFor example, a study by human rights non-profit Avaaz showed that 70% of COVID-19 misinformation in English ended up flagged with warning labels on Facebook. By contrast, only 30% of COVID-19 misinformation in Spanish was flagged. In her testimony before Congress, Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen said that the company spends 87% of its budget for combating misinformation on English language content despite the fact that only 9% of its users were English-speaking at the time.\n\nAccording to research firm Equis Research, 47% of Latino voters \u201coften\u201d use YouTube as a news source in a typical week. WhatsApp (and Facebook to a lesser extent) also constitute a source of information.\n\nThe EU\u2019s Digital Services Act requires platforms to be transparent in their content moderation, including disclosing the human resources allocated to content moderation, categorised according to each of the official languages of the EU. The latest reports reveal positive strides from Meta in Europe with 163 moderators for Spanish versus 109 for English, according to the company's own 2023 figures. Meta specifies that for languages like Spanish which are widely spoken outside of the EU, they have additional content reviewers but those numbers are not publicly available. YouTube, however, has over 15,000 moderators for their English-language content versus 507 for Spanish, according to the company\u2019s own 2023 figures.\n\n\u201c[Platforms] have a responsibility to their users and to the countries they operate in to uphold the governance systems that they\u2019ve benefited from,\u201d affirms Woolley. \u201cSo do the governments, and in particular groups in the United States like the Federal Elections Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, and the Securities and Exchange Commission, who have mandates to make sure the things they oversee are free and fair and actually democratic.\u201d\n\nWhile a lot of this false information originates and spreads through traditional social media outlets like Facebook and X, both Calzadilla and Rojas say that the most used platforms for Spanish-speakers are YouTube and WhatsApp, where posts that are already viral are amplified even further.\n\n\"In messaging services like WhatsApp it is very difficult to verify false information that\u2019s circulating,\" says Rojas. \"WhatsApp is super important in Latin America, which makes the information even go from one country to another: we get it from our moms to the United States and it goes back to Colombia or Costa Rica, for example. So there is an important flow that makes us Latinos much more vulnerable.\"\n\nWhile fact-checkers have debunked the conspiracy that Taylor Swift is a psy-op for the Democrats, Calzadilla says that images of the singer and other celebrities donning T-shirts against Trump quickly began to pop up. \u201cWe suspect that some were created by artificial intelligence,\u201d she says.\n\nCalzadilla and her colleagues first attempted to find the original images through a reverse image search, which quickly revealed that an actor simply photoshopped the celebrity\u2019s T-shirt to their liking. For the two celebrities whose original photos were not found, Barack Obama and Tom Hanks, the team analysed facial discrepancies and irregularities that revealed that the photos were indeed artificially generated. By that point, the independently circulated images were already seen thousands of times over X and TikTok.",

        "text": "Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador takes aim at U.S. politicians\nMexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador wields a lot of influence when it comes to curbing migrants illegally crossing the U.S. southern border. And as he made clear in a recent \"60 Minutes\" interview, he believes that power should be Mexico's to decide when to use.\n\nSpecifically, L\u00f3pez Obrador defended his country's sovereignty in response to hearing House Speaker Mike Johnson say recently that the U.S. could force Mexico to comply with American immigration policy.\n\n\"We are not a colony. We are not a protectorate of any foreign country,\" L\u00f3pez Obrador said through an interpreter to correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi in an interview earlier this month. \"And we have a very good relationship with the government of the United States \u2014 but not one of subordination.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson has called for President Biden to reinstate the \"Remain in Mexico\" policy for migrants seeking asylum in the U.S. While speaking to reporters last month, the Louisiana Republican recalled a conversation he had with Biden, in which Johnson urged him to reestablish the Trump-era policy and said it could potentially control the flow of migrants illegally entering the U.S.\n\n\"'Well, Mexico doesn't want that,'\" Johnson recalled the president answering.\n\n\"Mr. President,\" Johnson said he replied, \"we're the United States. Mexico will do what we say.\"\n\nFormer President Trump instated the Remain in Mexico policy, or Migrant Protection Protocols, in 2019. The program mandated that U.S. border officials return non-Mexican asylum seekers to Mexico, where they would wait for months \u2014 or even years \u2014 for their immigration cases to clear U.S. immigration courts. The U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 ruled 5-4 to rescind the policy.\n\nIn contrast to Johnson, L\u00f3pez Obrador told \"60 Minutes\" that Biden has been respectful of Mexico's sovereignty.\n\n\"Every time I speak with President Biden, the first thing he says to me is that our relationship must be on an equal footing,\" L\u00f3pez Obrador said.\n\nOther American politicians, however, have not understood this relationship, he said. Instead, they have heaped blame on Mexico for the migration challenge at the border, rather than reaching agreements and addressing what he sees as the root of the issue.\n\nL\u00f3pez Obrador also issued a critical assessment of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, whom he accessed of engaging in opportunism and \"cheap politicking\" with the border.\n\nTwo American politicians the Mexican president offered equal compliments for are the two men whose names are likely to be on the presidential ballot this fall. While L\u00f3pez Obrador will not be in office when Americans go to the polls in November \u2014 his own six-year term is up in September \u2014 his attitude toward both Biden and Trump suggests he wants to keep Mexico on good footing with Washington, no matter who wins the White House.\n\n\"President Trump, like President Biden, has been very respectful. Both of them,\" L\u00f3pez Obrador said. \"We have had differences, but we have been able to put first the general interest of both peoples, the people of the United States and the people of Mexico.\"\n\nThe video above was produced by Brit McCandless Farmer and edited by Scott Rosann.",

This would be required if no candidate gets more than 50% of the vote.\n\nMr Faye, 44, a senior official in the Pastef party led by Ousmane Sonko, had been in jail until 10 days before the vote. Mr Sonko was disqualified from the race because of a defamation conviction, which he said was politically motivated.\n\nThe first set of tallies announced on television showed Mr Faye had won the majority of votes, triggering widespread street celebrations in the capital, Dakar.\n\nSupporters set off fireworks, waved Senegalese flags and blew vuvuzelas.\n\nThe results led to five opposition candidates declaring Mr Faye the winner. Anta Babacar Ngom, the only female candidate, wished Mr Faye success in a statement.\n\nMr Faye has not yet commented.\n\nThe results being announced are from local media tallying the results posted outside individual polling stations.\n\nIt is not clear how many of the 15,633 polling stations have been counted so far. Official results are expected by Tuesday.\n\nMr Sonko backed Mr Faye, the co-creator of his now dissolved Pastef party, who was also detained almost a year ago on charges including defamation and contempt of court.\n\nAn amnesty law passed this month allowed their release days before the vote.\n\nThey have campaigned together under the banner \"Diomaye is Sonko\". Some high-profile politicians and opposition candidates have backed Mr Faye's candidacy.\n\n\"The population is choosing between continuation and rupture,\" Mr Faye said after casting his vote, urging contenders to accept the winner.\n\nPrepare for run-off\n\nMr Sall, the incumbent, was not on the ballot for the first time in Senegal's history. His ruling coalition picked Mr Ba, 62, a former prime minister.\n\nMr Ba's campaign said that \"considering the feedback of the results from our team of experts, we are certain that, in the worst-case scenario, we will go to a run-off\".\n\nAbout 7.3 million people were registered to vote in the country of around 18 million.\n\nThe election had been due to take place last month but Mr Sall postponed it, triggering deadly opposition protests.",

However, the governing coalition has said it was sure there would be a runoff.\n\nSenegalese opposition candidate and tax inspector Bassirou Diomaye Faye on Monday appeared to be reaching victory in Senegal's presidential election.\n\nThe vote follows several years of unrest and a political crisis. Millions of people took part in the election that went ahead without incident.\n\nState television RTS said that turnout was at around 71%.\n\nIf none of the 19 candidates secure over 50% of the votes, the election will go to a runoff. Final provisional results are expected by Tuesday.\n\nIncumbent President Macky Sall did not seek re-election, with his ruling coalition endorsing former prime minister Amadou Ba. Sall had unsuccessfully sought to postpone the election to December.\n\nFormer popular opposition leader Ousmane Sonko, who was barred from running in the election due to a defamation conviction, supported Faye in the vote.\n\nIn his campaign, Faye promised to fight corruption and prioritize Senegal's economic sovereignty.\n\nOpposition candidates congratulate Faye\n\nAt least seven candidates congratulated Faye based on the early tallies.\n\n\"Congratulations to Bassirou Diomaye Faye on his unquestionable victory,\" candidate Anta Babacar Ngom said on the platform X, formerly Twitter.\n\nDethie Fall referred to him as \"President ... Faye\" and congratulated him \"on his fine victory, clearly achieved in view of the very strong trends that are emerging.\"\n\nHundreds gathered at Faye's campaign headquarters in Dakar to celebrate as it seemed he was ahead in the vote.\n\nHowever, the management of Ba's campaign said that it was \"certain\" there would be a runoff vote.\n\n\"In the light of the results reported by our expert teams, we are certain that, in the worst-case scenario, we will be in a second-round,\" it said.\n\nBa's campaign accused Faye's camp of attempted \"manipulation.\"\n\nsdi/wd (Reuters, AFP)",

        "text": "Non-White voters turn away from the Democratic Party [THE SELECTION - Special US Election]\nThere\u2019s an unprecedented realignment happening right now in American politics. And if you don\u2019t pay attention to it, you may be blindsided by quite a few developments in this election season for the US presidential campaign.\n\nIn a nutshell, American political observers used to believe that the Democratic party was the party of racial minorities. However, pre-election poll data for presidential elections suggests that non-white voters are increasingly turning to the Republican party. Both parties are splitting the vote 50/50 in 2024, whereas the Democrats had a 75-25 edge over Republicans as late as in 2020.\n\nThis is congruent with the fact that former president Trump\u2019s support from blue-collar jobs is driving the candidate\u2019s momentum in the polls. Education has become a better litmus test than race or income when it comes to voting behavior in the United States. The political lines in the US are therefore shifting towards a more unpredictable electoral future. The ultimate outcome of this election is anyone\u2019s guess at this point.\n\nBy Jeremy Ghez, HEC Paris Professor of Economics and International Affairs. He is a specialist in geopolitics and American politics. He has covered previous US presidential elections for HEC and major international media.\n\nSources:\n\nThe Parties on the Eve of the 2016 Election: Two Coalitions, Moving Further Apart.

        "text": "Canada is already preparing for Trump's potential tariff threats\nCBC News got exclusive access to the Canadian lobbying effort on Capitol Hill to ensure that a transition goes smoothly if former U.S. president Donald Trump returns to the White House, especially because of the challenges expected in light of his America First policy.\n\nCanada staged a large-scale diplomatic deployment this week in preparation for a U.S. presidential election of more consequence than usual.\n\nMore than a dozen Canadian diplomats posted in various U.S. cities came to Washington to meet with scores of American lawmakers on Capitol Hill.\n\nLooming over their visit was the potential return of Donald Trump to the White House. In particular, there's one Trump policy they're watching warily this year.\n\nThe former president has promised a worldwide tariff on imported goods if he wins. This would be stricter than any trade policy from his first term.\n\nTrump has offered minimal details about the policy in his campaign literature and in media interviews but has said he envisions a 10 per cent global tax.\n\nWould that apply to Canada?\n\nNeither Canadian officials, nor Trump's allies, have a clear answer on that. Trump has been vague about which countries and products might be included or exempted.\n\nBut Canada's starting position, as one might expect, is that, no, there should not be penalties on a country \u2014 ours \u2014 that recently signed a free-trade agreement with Trump, which he has praised repeatedly as the best ever.\n\n\"We will have a serious conversation with them if they're looking to apply that policy to us,\" Kirsten Hillman, Canada's ambassador, told CBC News.\n\n\"But I think the starting point is that it shouldn't \u2014 and we have just concluded a deal that is 99 per cent tariff-free,\" she said, referring to the new NAFTA.\n\nKirsten Hillman, Canadian ambassador to the U.S., led a delegation that consisted of a dozen Canadian consuls-general to various U.S. cities as they met with over 50 members of Congress this week. (CBC)\n\nTariffs on Canada? Depends who you ask\n\nIt's worth watching Trump's platform closely, as current polls give him a decent chance of being returned to office in the November election.\n\nEven in Washington there's no clear consensus on what his policy might ultimately look like. Ask different people about tariffs on Canada, and you'll get different answers.\n\n\"I have a hard time believing that would be the case,\" Michigan Republican congressman Bill Huizenga told CBC News. \"Especially when it comes to the trade agreement that he negotiated, and led.\"\n\nNorth Dakota Sen. Kevin Cramer says that's exactly what he tells Trump: \"We talk about these things a fair bit,\" he said. \"I think we should have a North American strategy. Not a U.S.-only strategy.\"\n\nSen. Kevin Cramer, seen here in 2018 with Trump, says he speaks frequently to the former president and advises him against tariffs within North America. (Evan Vucci/The Associated Press)\n\nAn expert who supports Trump's tariff policies says he's not sure this will affect nations with free-trade deals; he suspects it probably will, but adds that Trump is attempting to do something unprecedented under modern law.\n\n\"There's literally no precedent,\" said Charles Benoit, a Canadian-born, U.S.-based trade lawyer with Coalition For A Prosperous America, a pro-domestic manufacturing group .\n\nHe expects Trump would invoke the Trade Act of 1974 . Its section 122 allows a president to set a maximum 15 per cent tariff, for up to 150 days, in the event of a balance-of-payments deficit with other nations, which the U.S. consistently has.\n\nHe says Trump could then try extending it, again and again, every 150 days. This would certainly trigger lawsuits, as the law says extending it requires an act of Congress.\n\nBenoit's advice: Let it lapse for a day, then keep reimposing the tariffs every 151 days.\n\n\"I think that that's something that the president could do. Just do it \u2014 [and] do it a second time after letting it lapse,\" he said in an interview.\n\nWATCH | U.S. and Canadian economies 'more integrated now than ever,' minister says: Economies of Canada and U.S. 'more integrated now than ever': Champagne Duration 9:46 Despite looming threats to Canada-U.S. trade relations from presidential candidate Donald Trump, 'Team Canada' is confident American industry leaders know that Canada is 'essential' to economic growth in North America, says Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne.\n\nOne of Washington's best-known trade-policy experts over several decades says such behaviour would make a mockery of the language in the bill.\n\nIt would be challenged in court, Gary Hufbauer said. Meanwhile, countries would launch retaliatory tariffs.\n\nAs for Canada, here's his prediction: The northern neighbour will get an exclusion, as would Mexico. But it won't come for free.\n\nHe expects Trump to use the threat as a negotiating ploy \u2014 a stick to threaten Canada and Mexico into making concessions.\n\n\"He will bargain \u2014 to get something for that exclusion,\" Hufbauer said, noting that when it comes to Trump, \"[It's] all transactional.\"\n\nAs for what Trump might ask for, he's already complained, as has the Biden administration , about the way Canada has implemented certain aspects of the new NAFTA. Specifically, dairy and autos.\n\n\"Dairy comes up right away,\" Hufbauer predicted.\n\nParsing the words of Trump's trade czar\n\nOne thing Trump has already succeeded at doing is reorienting the American political consensus on trade.\n\nThe current Biden administration has maintained most of his policies. The two presidents may differ in style, but they agree substantively on trade.\n\nThat philosophy has been articulated at length by Trump's former trade minister. In his book and several magazine pieces , Robert Lighthizer has laid out some of the tariff policies Trump is now running on.\n\nTrump's former trade minister Robert Lighthizer, seen here in 2020, remains influential. He has advocated for these tariffs and argued in detail for why the U.S. needs tougher trade policy. (Andrew Harnik/Reuters)\n\nLighthizer remains in the picture: He's advising the Trump campaign, and recently said publicly that he intends to be involved in the next administration if Trump wins; either serving in an official role, or as an outside adviser.\n\nHis basic argument is that globalization has impoverished the U.S. working class; made the country incapable of producing vital goods; lost manufacturing industries that drive innovation; and left it dependent on a potential military rival (China) for basic everyday products.\n\nHe has little patience for people who call the United States protectionist, when it has among the lowest tariffs in the world.\n\nAnd when it comes to Canada, Lighthizer's book takes the country to task for seeing itself as a free trader, then adopting \"parochial\" and \"protectionist\" policies around everything from dairy to television to telecoms.\n\nHe said tariffs on Canadian and Mexican steel were useful; Trump imposed them, then lifted them, and threatened to reimpose them.\n\n\"The fact that President Trump was willing to impose tariffs on two of America's closest trading partners \u2014 one of whom, Canada, is also one of our closest allies \u2014 sent an unmistakable signal that business as usual was over,\" Lighthizer wrote in his book, No Trade Is Free.\n\nWATCH | Canada and Mexico win first test of new NAFTA: Canada, Mexico defeat U.S. in auto part rules dispute Duration 1:31 Mexico and Canada have won a trade dispute with the United States over rules of origin for auto parts, which could help protect Canadian businesses and jobs.\n\nWhat next?\n\nThe tangible effects of Trump's trade policies remain in dispute.\n\nSeveral studies say his tariffs had a minimal positive impact on U.S. jobs , and a minimal harmful impact on the economy and inflation .\n\nOne trade economist and historian says Trump's policies shifted some production from China, primarily to Vietnam and Mexico; meanwhile, China bought more food from Brazil.\n\n\"In the political debate, both the benefits and the costs [of tariffs] tend to get exaggerated,\" said Douglas Irwin of Dartmouth College.\n\nBut what Trump is proposing now is bigger than his first-term tariffs , which the Congressional Budget Office said shaved 0.3 per cent off the U.S. economy.\n\nTrump also wants Congress to pass a law that would allow reciprocal tariffs \u2014 massive duties on countries with high tariffs, like India and China.\n\nTrump touts his tariffs on washing machines at an Ohio Whirlpool plant in 2020. A study by economists at the U.S. Federal Reserve says those tariffs created 1,800 jobs, but raised prices on washing machines by about $90. It's an example of how tariffs had small effects, both positive and negative. (Joshua Roberts/Reuters)\n\nIrwin says the real risk is that in the long term, Trump's policies could trigger a domino effect, toppling the rules-based trading system, making commerce more political and less predictable and leading to tit-for-tat retaliation. He says countries that rely most heavily on the U.S. for trade are the most vulnerable.\n\n\"You're right to be worried in Canada.\"\n\nBenoit takes the opposite view. If Trump managed to enact his entire agenda, with the biggest tariffs on Asia, he says Canada would enjoy a renaissance in manufacturing .\n\nInstead of reflexively opposing some of these policies, he says Canada should offer to team up with Trump to impose similar tariffs against China.\n\n\"Canada should say: 'We're with you. We're walking shoulder to shoulder with you,' \" Benoit said.",

With the primaries decided so early in both parties, this will be one of the longest general election campaigns in modern American history.\n\nTwo Candidates Rejected by the American Voter\n\nThe two opponents faced no real competition in the primaries; Biden has won all the primaries that have taken place to date, with the exception of American Samoa, and the same is true for Trump, who has won all the Republican primaries to date, with the exception of Vermont and Washington, D.C., which he lost to his rival, Nikki Haley. However, opinion polls show that the majority of Americans are not enthusiastic about a second round of competition between the two men who faced off in the 2020 elections and the resulting sharp divisions that many fear will deepen further in the coming months. Trump still insists that the presidency was stolen from him in 2020 by rigging the election results in favor of Biden, and this opinion is held by a third of Americans.1 Trump faces a package of criminal cases, some of which are related to his attempt to influence the election results in the state of Georgia, which he lost by a few thousand votes to Biden, and his accusation of inciting his supporters to storm the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, in an attempt to prevent the certification of the results of the presidential elections.\n\nRecent opinion polls indicate that only 38 percent of Americans support, although previous experience show that the incumbent needs to exceed the threshold of 50 percent of popular support to win a second term.2 Biden is the least popular incumbent president since World War II seeking re-election. George Bush Sr., and Trump himself, lost their reelections in 1992 and 2020, respectively, when the percentage of popular satisfaction with their performance was around 40 percent.3 However, at 40 percent, Trump\u2019s popularity does not look much better.\n\nBiden and Trump are working to mobilize the \u201ccounter-voter\u201d of the opponent, aware of their low popularity, under the pretext that these elections are crucial and the future of America depends on them.4 After securing his party\u2019s nomination, Biden gave a speech in which he described Trump as a dangerous threat to democracy, and that he \u201cruns a campaign of bitterness and revenge that threatens the very idea of \u200b\u200bAmerica.\u201d Likewise, Trump declared after celebrating \u201cD-Day\u201d over his rival Haley that it was necessary \u201cto get back to work because we have the worst president in the history of our country.\u201d\n\nStill, the majority of Americans are still not enthusiastic about the fact that the two men are the presidential nominees this year, with 56 percent of American adults saying they would be \u201cvery\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d dissatisfied if Biden was the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential nominee; Biden is 81 years old, and he is the oldest president in the history of the United States, and the effects of his age on his mental and physical abilities are obvious. Fifty-eight percent of voters said they would be \u201cvery\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d dissatisfied if Trump, who is 77 years old and faces criminal, civil, federal, and state cases, becomes the Republican Party\u2019s nominee. While Biden and Trump enjoy the support of the majority of their parties\u2019 bases\u2014three-quarters of Democrats say their view of Biden is positive while 7 out of 10 Republicans say the same thing about Trump\u2014the category of \u201cstrongly supportive\u201d of Trump within the Republican Party (46 percent) is higher than its counterpart within the Democratic Party in favor of Biden (34 percent).5 Although the percentage of those who view Biden and Trump negatively among the general electorate is equal (55 percent), Republicans are more enthusiastic about a second presidential term for Trump (44 percent), compared to 22 percent of Democrats for Biden.6\n\nGeneral Public Mood\n\nMost opinion polls conducted in early March show a slight lead for Trump over Biden, ranging between two and four points.7 Although the results of all current opinion polls are within the margin of error, they paint a pessimistic picture of Biden\u2019s chances. The results of these polls indicate that Trump is ahead of Biden in the states of Arizona, Georgia, and Nevada by five points or more. Biden won the states of Arizona, Georgia, and Wisconsin in the 2020 elections by one percentage point or less, while no Democratic presidential candidate has lost the state of Nevada since 2004. However, even if Biden loses all of those states, he can still win the presidency if he wins the rest of the other states that he won in 2020, and that will give him 270 Electoral College votes versus 268 for Trump. But Biden needs to win the swing state of Michigan, where support is declining for several reasons, the most important of which is his support for the Israeli aggression on the Gaza Strip.8\n\nA CBS News poll conducted earlier this March says that Trump leads Biden 52 to 48 percent among likely voters. However, a subsequent poll conducted by Reuters/Ipsos showed that Biden had a one percentage point lead over Trump since registered voters nationally support him more than they support Trump. Only two-thirds of eligible voters participated in the 2020 presidential election, in which Biden defeated Trump. However, the same poll shows a Trump lead over Biden (40 to 37 percent) among registered voters in the seven states whose results were very close in 2020.9 Since the elections are held on the basis of states and not at the national level, this means that Biden may win the popular vote, but lose in the electoral college.\n\nAn opinion poll conducted by USA Today and Suffolk University after Biden\u2019s State of the Union address in Congress on March 7 shows that American voters\u2019 views on the state of the economy have reached their highest level during Biden\u2019s presidency. A third of registered voters said they believe the economy is recovering since the Covid-19 pandemic, but this did not increase support for Biden.\n\nThe electoral landscape becomes even more ambiguous if we take into account the factor of independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy, who opinion polls indicate will have the support of 15 percent of registered voters if he is able to obtain enough signatures to put his name on ballots in a number of states. Kennedy\u2019s campaign says it has enough signatures to include his name in six states, including Nevada, Arizona, South Carolina, Georgia, and New Hampshire. Although it is difficult to say whom Kennedy\u2019s candidacy will harm more, Biden or Trump, as it appears that he is attracting equal support from both, the Biden campaign fears that this might cost it the states of Nevada and New Hampshire, and thus, the presidency.10\n\nBiden\u2019s and Trump\u2019s Chances\n\nPresident Biden is considered to be in a strong electoral position to win a second presidential term, as his current presidency saw the passage of a number of major pieces of legislation, such as the infrastructure development laws in 2021 and the semiconductor construction laws in 2022, in addition to a strong economy, low unemployment, and high growth. In addition, it has re-enhanced confidence in the American leadership among allies in the world, especially in NATO, after doubts prevailed about it during Trump\u2019s presidency. The Biden campaign and the Democratic National Committee currently have more than $130 million, double what the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee have, giving Biden an advantage in the coming weeks in terms of advertising, opening his campaign\u2019s election offices in swing states, and hiring more staff.\n\nStill, these achievements did not enhance Biden\u2019s popular and electoral standing; This is due to the rise in food prices, basic supplies, and rent, as well as sustained inflation, despite its decline in recent months. These are factors that affect the average American citizen, and make him doubt the president\u2019s promises to restore normal life after the Corona pandemic, which his predecessor, Trump, was accused of failing to address. The challenges facing Biden in dealing with the border crisis and reducing the number of illegal immigrants provide Trump with an opportunity to raise the fears of a wide segment of white Americans about what he describes as a \u201cforeign invasion\u201d of the country. Many Americans, including the disinterested ranks of the Democratic Party, also fear that Biden will not be medically qualified for a second term that ends when he turns 86 years old.11 The effects of aging are evident on Biden, both physically and mentally. This is despite his attempts to reassure skeptical voters that he is still capable of holding the most important office in the world.\n\nHowever, the biggest challenge facing Biden is maintaining the broad Democratic coalition that former President Barack Obama built in 2008, which guaranteed him two presidential terms, and which Hillary Clinton was unable to sustain, and this cost her the 2016 elections to Trump. This coalition consists of the traditional base of the Democratic Party, the progressive and liberal movement, minorities, women, and youth. Biden was able to restore this alliance in 2020, driven by the desire of its components at the time to get rid of Trump, which helped him win the presidency. But the situation is very different today than it was in 2020.\n\nThe Democratic primaries on Super Tuesday, March 5, revealed a rift in Biden\u2019s electoral coalition that may amount to an organized protest rebellion against him because of his position on the Israeli war on Gaza.12 More than 100,000 (13 percent) of Arabs, Muslims, progressives, and youth voted \u201cnon-committed\u201d in the primary elections in the swing state of Michigan, expressing their anger at the absolute support that Biden provides for the Israeli aggression on the Gaza Strip, and his failure to impose a ceasefire there. This was repeated in Minnesota, where about 46,000 (20 percent) voted \u201cnot committed.\u201d Democratic ballots in six other states on Super Tuesday, namely Alabama, Colorado, Iowa, Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Tennessee, witnessed \u201cnon-committal\u201d votes, and the percentages in those states ranged between 3.9 percent in the state of Iowa and 12.7 percent in the state of North Carolina.13\n\nClinton lost the state of Michigan to Trump in 2016 by less than 11,000 votes, while Biden won it against Trump in 2020 by less than 155,000 votes. Current opinion polls show Trump ahead of Biden in that state. The same is true for the state of Minnesota, which Clinton won in 2016 against Trump by less than 44,000 votes. As for the state of North Carolina, which Biden succeeded in wresting from Trump in 2020 with less than 74,000 votes, more than 88,000 voted \u201cnot committed.\u201d\n\nAs for Trump, despite being the first former president to be indicted on criminal charges, he was able to defeat all of his rivals in the Republican Party early in the primaries. Despite the turmoil and chaos that accompanied the four years of his presidency, most opinion polls show him ahead of Biden, especially in a number of swing states. The Trump campaign is now focusing its efforts on the states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Georgia, and Arizona.\n\nHowever, Trump faces significant challenges that may derail his bid for a second term. On the one hand, he faces four separate criminal cases, with a total of 91 charges. On the other hand, he suffers from weak support among certain segments of voters, even from within his party. An opinion poll showed that only about 37 percent of supporters of his Republican rival, Nikki Haley, intend to vote for him after she withdrew from the competition for the Republican Party nomination. About 16 percent said they would vote for Biden, while the rest said they would vote for someone else or not vote at all.14 The Republican primaries showed that Trump has a problem with voters in cities, college towns, and suburbs, which are home to moderate and more educated Republicans. For example, in the swing state of North Carolina, which has a growing number of college-educated voters, 81 percent of those who supported Haley said they would not vote for Trump in November.15 In addition, Biden\u2019s accusations that Trump represents a threat to democracy have proven effective in the 2022 midterm elections, and may be an influential factor in the upcoming presidential elections. Trump recently threatened a \u201cbloodbath\u201d if he lost these elections.16\n\nConclusion\n\nIt is too early to predict who will win the upcoming US presidential elections, but it is clear that the two candidates, the Democrat and the Republican, are not very popular among voters, and their weaknesses are clear. Therefore, the United States may be on the cusp of a major political and legal battle, if one of the two candidates does not win a decisive victory, which could put the stability of the country to a major test.\n\nThis situation assessment was first published in Arabic on March 21, 2024 by Arab Center for Research and Policy Studies.\n\nThe views expressed in this publication are the author\u2019s own and do not necessarily reflect the position of Arab Center Washington DC, its staff, or its Board of Directors.",

        "text": "Immigration policy and the 2024 presidential election\nAs the 2024 U.S. presidential election kicks into gear, an issue already taking center stage both among candidates and the electorate is immigration. Immigration has been front-page news, from dramatic scenes along the border to the State of the Union address to a Texas migrant law playing out in the courts.\n\n\u201cImmigration is such a central theme in both campaigns. At the same time, all the media attention goes to the so-called \u2018border crisis\u2019 that we\u2019ve been hearing about nonstop for three years,\u201d says Chenoa Flippen, sociologist and director of the Center for the Study of Ethnicity, Race, and Immigration (CSERI). \u201cSo much so that there is a lot less attention to other really important things that the Biden administration has been doing.\u201d\n\nAn April 2 symposium, co-sponsored by the Penn Migration Initiative, Population Studies Center, and CSERI, aims to shed light on other important aspects of immigration policy. The symposium will bring together policy analysts, immigration scholars, and representatives of nonprofit advocacy organizations to discuss immigration policies and their impact, as well as the role of academic research in informing the broader debate.\n\nMuch of today\u2019s immigration policy has been shaped by congressional gridlock and the increased role of the executive branch in shaping the country\u2019s immigration agenda, Flippen says. In President Biden\u2019s first three years, he signed more than 535 immigration-related executive actions.\n\n\u201cWe hope to move away from all the hype and media frenzy over the border and examine what the Biden administration has actually done. To what extent are his policies a break from the past versus a continuation of prior administrations? Over 500 executive actions is a lot to keep track of,\u201d says Flippen. \u201cWe also want to understand the community impact of those changes.\u201d\n\nThe first panel, moderated by political science professor Michael Jones-Correa, will look at contemporary immigration policy and the role of immigration in America\u2019s future. It will offer a bird\u2019s eye view of the Biden administration\u2019s policies, the current debate, and what immigration policy might look like under different scenarios. Speakers include Ariel Ruiz, senior policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute; Dara Lind, senior fellow at the American Immigration Council; and Angela Kelley of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.\n\nThe second panel, moderated by Penn Carey Law\u2019s Fernando Chang-Muy, will feature Sarah Paoletti, law professor and director of Penn Carey Law\u2019s Transnational Legal Clinic; as well as Margie McHugh, director of the National Center on Immigration Integration Policy; and Erin Argueta, Senior Lead Attorney at the Southern Poverty Law Center. The panel will examine the impact of Biden\u2019s immigration policies and enforcement and will shed light on how current policies are experienced by local communities and institutions.\n\n\u201cWe really want to provide a much more comprehensive, complex view of what\u2019s happening on the immigration stage than people get in their news feeds,\u201d Flippen says. \u201cThis is a continuation of decades-long policies, and this is an incredibly complex issue. We need to understand it in a broader context.\u201d\n\nAmanda Pinheiro, a postdoctoral fellow at Perry World House, is one of the co-organizers of the symposium. Her research \u201cinvestigates the human cost of racially charged migration deterrence policies and practices in the Americas, foregrounding race in global migration research and policymaking.\u201d\n\nThere are very new dynamics in terms of asylum seekers at the U.S.-Mexico border, she says, from Venezuelans and Ukrainians to people from Afghanistan and Pakistan. Last year, at the treacherous Darien Gap, more than half a million migrants crossed from Colombia to Panama.\n\n\u201cWe have migrants from Afghanistan going all the way to Brazil and crossing 11 countries. These are unprecedented dynamics across the Americas,\u201d says Pinheiro.\n\nShe says it\u2019s important to pay attention to these dynamics in global migration, and she hopes the symposium sheds some light on how these migratory movements are shaping politics and how politics are shaping those movements.\n\n\u201cThis issue will have a great impact on the outcome of these U.S. elections. We need to look at its political importance, but also we have to pay attention to what\u2019s happening in this country from the perspective of the migrant,\u201d she says.\n\nEstefan\u00eda Casta\u00f1eda-P\u00e9rez, a postdoctoral fellow at the Penn Migration Initiative conducting research on the consequences of border policing and immigration laws, is one of the co-organizers of the symposium. She says it\u2019s important to center dignity and human rights protections when looking at immigration issues.\n\n\u201cThe U.S.-Mexico border is often portrayed as a zone in perpetual crisis, which serves to increase support for stepped-up militarization at the cost of human rights protections,\u201d she says. \u201cYet, the dangers that migrants experience are often minimized. We hope that audience members will get a greater understanding of the realities and challenges facing migrants and their advocates as they seek to address border violence from the perspectives of academic scholarship, advocacy, and policy.\u201d\n\nRegistration information for the symposium can be found on the Center for the Study of Ethnicity, Race, and Immigration\u2019s website: https://cseri.sas.upenn.edu/events/2024/04/02/symposium-immigration-policy-and-2024-election",

        "text": "What Can the Next President of Mexico Offer Her Constituents in the United States?\nBoth Claudia Sheinbaum and X\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez have gone on tour in the United States since their campaigns began, both courting the votes of the millions of Mexican nationals living on the northern side of the border. The National Electoral Institute (INE) has continued to expand the ways that Mexican nationals can vote while abroad, hoping to both increase turnout and make Mexican nationals feel more connected to their country of origin despite living in the United States and, in the case of people without authorized immigration status, being unable to visit Mexico and subsequently return to their home in the US.\n\nThe discourse of the Morena government has done far more to recognize Mexican nationals than previous governments have. Both Morena\u2019s founder, President Andres Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador (AMLO), and its current presidential candidate, Sheinbaum, have praised emigrants for their contributions to the Mexican economy in the form of remittances, while also celebrating that more and more migrants have been returning to Mexico in the past decade. This discourse is in line with the general emphasis that Morena has on centering the most economically vulnerable. Mexicans who leave for the United States without authorized immigrant status tend to be those seeking to escape economic precarity, making them an important part of the population that Morena was founded on trying to reach.\n\nWhile the recognition and praise as \u201cHeroes Paisanos\u201d (\u201cCompatriot Heroes\u201d) is nice and might in and of itself be helpful for winning consular votes, what concrete benefits can the Mexican government offer its emigrant constituents? Expansion of consular services can go a long way without causing much political controversy. Mexican consulates already offer a much more expansive set of services than any other country with comparable numbers of immigrants in the United States, specifically when it comes to monitoring and supporting Mexican nationals in their interactions with US law enforcement, but getting a passport or consular ID appointment can feel impossible. Not having a valid photo ID presents a wide array of impediments to basic mobility and access to services, and for many Mexican nationals without immigration status in the US, a passport or consular ID is their only option. Resources invested in expanding access to these appointments can provide a simple but necessary lifeline for unauthorized immigrants who do not have another way to acquire a valid photo ID.\n\nRecently, however, AMLO has been pushing for far more ambitious and impactful plans. His government has cooperated extensively with the Biden Administration on matters ranging from accepting people who have been removed from the United States and securitizing the Mexican-Guatemalan border, and is now seeking a broad package of benefits from the US in exchange. Among his ideas are a $20 billion Marshall Plan-style investment in Latin America, the removal of the Cuban Blockade and sanctions on Venezuela, and, most consequentially for migrants, a mass immigration status regularization program for people from Latin America who have been living and working in the United States for 10 years or more, commonly known as amnesty.\n\nAs far-fetched as any form of amnesty seems in the current US political environment, relief for unauthorized immigrants who meet certain requirements is an idea that has been present throughout the history of immigration policy. Traditionally, amnesty has been offered as a counterweight to increases in enforcement in other areas of immigration law, as was the case in the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act that granted a path to Permanent Residence and subsequently Citizenship to almost three million qualifying immigrants. Since then, narrower forms of permanent or temporary legal forgiveness of unauthorized status have taken effect to protect certain nationalities or, in the case of DACA, people who were brought to the country as children, from deportation. These more recent protections have been the result of administrative adjustments and have not been codified by Congress, meaning they remain vulnerable to changes in administration or challenges in the courts. In the years since the creation of the Department of Homeland Security in 2003 and the placement of immigration enforcement within it, dramatically increasing securitization and detention of immigrants have far outpaced any new forms of relief. The result has been a bloated system that inflicts more punishment for lesser offenses at enormous human and economic costs, enriching security contractors and smugglers while cutting off opportunities for immigrants to build lives for themselves through formal channels.\n\nIt is long past time to counter the mass securitization of immigration policy with new paths to authorized status, and the Morena government has every right to continue to use its leverage to press for amnesty wherever possible. Beyond the obvious humanitarian benefits to the recipients of regularized immigration status, amnesty has a host of benefits for both the US and Mexico as a whole. Immigration from Mexico to the US has also been hovering around a net-zero rate for years. Many more Mexican nationals would be free to go back and forth if they knew that they were not jeopardizing their ability to re-enter the United States by doing so, enabling them to contribute to their communities on both sides of the border. Authorized status would also allow Mexican nationals to legally work in the United States, which would increase both formal domestic production in the US and potential remittances that boost the Mexican economy.\n\nIf they continue to push for this relief until some form of it is granted, AMLO and Sheinbaum will succeed in widely expanding not only their party\u2019s voter base but also their economic and cultural impact as Mexican nationals in the United States are afforded the opportunity to formally contribute to the well-being of both nations.",

        "text": "Q&A: 2024 Election Coverage Prompting Burnout? You're Not Alone\nDo you feel this election and news cycle is different from others in the past? How is coverage changing? We already know who the nominees will be. There hasn\u2019t been as much traditional activity as there has been in the past. Much news is focused on people leaving Congress due to its dysfunction, causing anxiety about the direction of the Congress in the future. Also, we now accept extreme viewpoints and hear them constantly. I think this causes a lot of concern. This has resulted in much apathy among voters. There is much concern that many people will not vote. The ever-increasing amount of political social media spots causes one to tune out as they are inundated with requests. I get lots of emails and texts from candidates all over the country that I know nothing about.\n\nWhat can constant exposure to this coverage do to us? People generally react in two distinct ways: One is to become more anxious and worried about the country\u2019s future, and two is to tune out and become disinterested and simply escape the issues.\n\nHow widespread is election fatigue? Most people I talk with are not paying much attention given the current reality of the nominees being set. They have yet to pay attention to the local primaries as again, most are already settled. Social media is the primary culprit in tuning out.\n\nWhat can happen if we chose to avoid media altogether, or are selective about our sources? For many, it is too early to get immersed in the media. Selecting one\u2019s sources can be quite problematic and can result in poor decision-making regarding elections. It becomes a type of group think that causes one\u2019s judgement to turn off. There are several studies demonstrating that increasing peoples\u2019 awareness using various sources changes their opinion. I have seen this firsthand with family members.\n\nWhat are some ways to avoid apathy and stay engaged? Focus on issues that are important to you. What creates fire in your belly or keeps you up at night. It could be healthcare, tax reform, the environment, etc. And do what you can to support your position.\n\nWhat advice do you have for the well-informed among us who choose to remain disengaged due to burnout? I think similar to above. What is the issue that is most important to you? It could be local issues, such as the unhoused, water issues, etc. Just find that thing, and focus on it.",

        "text": "Wisconsin\u2019s New Regulation of AI and Deepfakes in Political Communications\nAs the capabilities of generative artificial intelligence have increased, so have concerns that generative AI might be used to manipulate voters and the administration of elections in the 2024 presidential election and primaries. The first warning shot came in New Hampshire on January 21, 2024, two days before the New Hampshire Presidential Primary Election, when numerous New Hampshire residents received robocalls that played a message with what appeared to be an AI-generated voice clone of President Joe Biden\u2019s voice, encouraging recipients not to vote in the January 23, 2024 primary. The \u201cdeepfake\u201d simulated voice of President Biden urged residents to \u201csave\u201d their vote for the November 2024 U.S. Presidential Election.\n\nWithin days, the New Hampshire Attorney General\u2019s Office Election Law Unit launched an investigation into these calls in coordination with state and federal partners, including the Anti-Robocall Multistate Litigation Task Force, which is a bipartisan task force made up of 50 state attorneys general, and the Federal Communications Commission Enforcement Bureau.[1] In addition, the League of Women Voters of New Hampshire, the League of Women Voters of the United States, and several individuals have filed a civil lawsuit in federal court in New Hampshire alleging claims under Section 11(b) of the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965, the federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act, and the New Hampshire Election Laws for the unlawful infringement of voting rights and the distribution of unlawful robocalls.[2]\n\nIn November 2023, proposed legislation (2023 Assembly Bill 664) was introduced in the Wisconsin Assembly to regulate the use of deepfakes in Wisconsin\u2019s elections.\n\nSummary of the new Wisconsin law on synthetic media in political communications\n\nOn March 21, 2024, Governor Tony Evers signed a new law, 2023 Wisconsin Act 123,[3] which regulates the use of synthetic media in audio and video political communications. The law requires that any audio or video communication make certain disclosures if the communication: (1) is paid for by a candidate committee, legislative campaign committee, political action committee, independent expenditure committee, political party, recall committee, or referendum committee with a contribution or disbursement; (2) contains synthetic media; and (3) contains express advocacy (as defined under current law), issue advocacy, or supports or opposes a referendum. The law defines \u201csynthetic media\u201d as audio or video content substantially produced by means of generative artificial intelligence. Wis. Stat. \u00a7 11.1303(2m)(a)2. The law defines \u201cissue advocacy\u201d as a communication that provides information about political or social issues and is made to influence the outcome of an election. Wis. Stat. \u00a7 11.1303(2m)(a)1.\n\nUnder the law, every such audio communication must include at both the beginning and the end of the communication the words \u201cContains content generated by AI.\u201d Wis. Stat. \u00a7 11.1303(2m)(b).\n\nThe law provides that every such video communication must include throughout the duration of each portion of the communication containing synthetic media, in writing that is readable, legible, and readily accessible, the words \u201cThis video content generated by AI\u201d if the video includes video synthetic media only, \u201cThis audio content generated by AI\u201d if the video includes audio synthetic media only, or \u201cThis content generated by AI\u201d if the video includes both video and audio synthetic media. Wis. Stat. \u00a7 11.1303(2m)(c).\n\nThe law imposes a forfeiture of up to $1,000 for each violation of the law\u2019s requirements, enforced in the same manner as other similar violations of Wisconsin\u2019s laws regulating campaigns (Wis. Stat. \u00a7 11.1303(2m)(f)), and authorizes the Ethics Commission to adopt rules creating limited exceptions to the bill\u2019s disclosure requirements (Wis. Stat. \u00a7 11.1303(2m)(d)). Compliance with the new law does not create an exemption from any civil or criminal liability, including for violations of Wis. Stat. \u00a7 12.05 (prohibiting false statements affecting elections). Wis. Stat. \u00a7 11.1303(2m)(e).\n\nFinally, the law specifies that no liability for a violation of the law\u2019s disclosure requirements shall attach to a broadcaster or other host or carrier of a video or audio communication and that the law may not be construed to alter or negate any rights, obligations, or immunities of a computer service or Internet access provider under federal law.\n\nWho is regulated? Committees, not individuals, corporations, or social media platforms.\n\nWisconsin\u2019s approach to regulating synthetic media in audio and video political communications focuses on certain communications paid for by contributions to, or disbursements by committees as defined by Wis. Stat. \u00a7 11.0101(6). The new law also immunizes social media platforms from liability for a violation of the law\u2019s disclosure requirement. Wis. Stat. \u00a7 11.1303(2m)(g). If, for example, a candidate committee posts a deepfake on an online platform, the platform cannot be held liable for hosting even though the candidate committee could be.\n\nWhat is regulated? Audio and visual deepfakes, not cheapfakes.\n\nThe new law covers only audio and video synthetic media\u2014sometimes called deepfakes\u2014that is, digital audio or video created using an editing process that is automated through generative artificial intelligence (GAI) techniques. Regulated deepfakes might, for example, depict a real candidate or politician saying something they did not say or an entirely fake person. The law does not regulate manipulated media\u2014sometimes called cheapfakes or shallowfakes. Manipulated media can be as simple as mislabeling videos, or audio clips to imply they are from a different time or location, or editing a piece of media to make it look like something happened that did not. The new law also does not regulate the use of deepfake photos.\n\nHow are deepfakes regulated? The disclosure requirement.\n\nThe new law requires disclosure that certain communications contain synthetic media; it does not ban such communications.\n\nStafford Rosenbaum LLP\u2019s Election and Political Law Practice attorneys continue to monitor ongoing efforts to regulate AI in political advertising at the federal, state, and industry levels.

        "text": "Changes to First Past the Post style Electoral College increase chances of Trump victory\nBarring an act of God, 5 November 2024 will see a rematch of the 2020 US Presidential election between Joe Biden and Donald Trump.\n\nLooking back at the nationwide result in 2020, you would be forgiven for thinking that Biden secured a relatively comfortable victory, winning 7 million more votes than Trump. Biden won over half the votes cast (51.3%), finishing 4.4 percentage points ahead of Trump (46.9%).\n\nHowever, unlike almost all other Presidential elections throughout the world, the US President is not elected via the popular vote. If they were, then Donald Trump would never have taken office. In 2016, Hillary Clinton received around 3 million more votes than Trump (48.0% to 45.9%).\n\nHow did Trump become President without ever winning the popular vote? The answer is the Electoral College (EC).\n\nThe First Past the Post style Electoral College\n\nEach state (and the District of Columbia) is allocated a number of EC votes, roughly in proportion to their population. The number of EC votes varies from 54 for California to three each for Alaska, Delaware, District of Columbia, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont and Wyoming. In order to become President, a candidate needs to reach 270 EC votes.\n\nAlmost every state applies a winner-takes-all approach to allocating their EC votes, which means, just like in First Past the Post, winning a state by a wide margin is of no extra benefit to a candidate than winning it by a narrow margin. Take the 2020 results from the two most populous states, California (55 Electoral College votes) and Texas (38 Electoral College votes). Biden won California by a margin of 5.1 million votes (63.5% to 34.3%), whereas Trump won Texas by a much smaller 631,000 votes (52.1% to 46.5%). However, no differentiation is made, the winner takes all of the EC votes in each state.\n\nIn 2020, Biden secured 306 EC votes to 232 EC votes for Trump (based on how the public voted on election day). Again, on paper, this looks like a fairly comfortable EC victory for Biden, but digging deeper into the state-by-state votes shows this was far from the case.\n\nThe three closest results were in states won by Biden by less than one percentage point \u2013 Wisconsin (Biden\u2019s majority = 20,682); Georgia (12,670); and Arizona (10,457). In order for Trump to become President again in 2024, all he has to do is flip these three states, which in 2020 had a combined Biden majority of just 43,809 votes. A drop in the ocean compared to the 7 million majority Biden enjoyed nationwide.\n\nChanges to the number of Electoral College votes each state has\n\nWinning these three states would give Trump an extra 37 EC votes. Added to the 232 EC votes he won in 2020, this would put him on 269 EC votes, still one short of an outright victory. However, the number of votes each state has is partially based on their populations. Due to population changes in the 2020 US Census, the number of EC votes assigned to each state has changed. Victory in these three states, plus the states he won in 2020, would put Trump across the winning line on 272 EC votes.\n\nFirst Past the Post means millions of votes don\u2019t matter\n\nThe Electoral College shares similar drawbacks to our winner-takes-all First Past The Post (FPTP) system used at UK general elections. Both create \u2018safe\u2019 seats, where everyone knows who is going to win before a single vote has been cast, meaning voters in these places are taken for granted. Candidates can pile up votes in these \u2018safe\u2019 seats, for no extra benefit, for example, of the ten largest majorities at the 2019 UK general election, nine were in urban, Labour-held seats in London and Merseyside.\n\nThey can both cause \u2018wrong winner\u2019 elections, for example neither Al Gore or Hilary Clinton became President, despite getting more votes than their opponents (George W Bush and Trump) in 2000 and 2016 respectively. While in the UK, in 1951, Labour got more votes than the Conservatives but the Tories won more seats. In February 1974, the position was reversed, with the Conservatives winning more votes but Labour gaining a higher number of seats.\n\nIt looks increasingly likely that the next UK general election will be held in the autumn of 2024, around the same time as the US Presidential election. Within a matter of weeks we will witness national elections held under electoral systems that are prone to producing random and volatile results.

        "text": "AI, lies and conspiracy theories: How Latinos became a key target for misinformation in the US election\nIs Taylor Swift a Pentagon psychological operations asset? Did Texas governor Greg Abbott say that Joe Biden needs to learn from Vladimir Putin to work for the interest of the United States? Did Donald Trump say that the 9/11 attacks were an inside job of the US government? Has the US military arrived in Ecuador to \u2018kill terrorists\u2019?\n\nIf you scroll through Spanish-language TikTok, X, and Facebook, you may have seen some of these falsehoods that aim to negatively portray Democrats or Republicans, depending on which fake news you encounter.\n\nUS voters will head to the polls on 5 November in the first presidential election since the rise of generative AI. Audiences might be exposed to audio, images and videos created with Midjourney, Dall-E, ChatGPT and other tools. But they will definitely encounter more traditional forms of misinformation, which tend to be based on true information that\u2019s spun, twisted, recontextualised, or reworked by activists and campaigners with the goal of reinforcing partisan narratives, just as the stories above show.\n\nThroughout the past couple of decades, US Latinos have been the target for these kinds of mis- and disinformation campaigns. With an estimated 36.2 million of Latinos being eligible to vote in 2024, up from 32.3 million in 2020, they make up the biggest minority group in the country with a significant say on its future, as many live in battleground states such as Florida, Arizona, Nevada, and Georgia.\n\nTo understand what narratives are being disseminated to Spanish-speakers in the US, I spoke to three experts who are tracking them and fact-checking them to Spanish-speaking audiences.\n\nLee este art\u00edculo en espa\u00f1ol\n\nHow Latinos are targeted\n\nTamoa Calzadilla is the editor-in-chief of Factchequado, a digital fact-checking outlet focusing on disinformation in Spanish in the United States. She stresses that US Latinos are not a monolith voting group and explains that different narratives target different communities depending on where you come from.\n\n\u201cI live here in a community in Miami with many Venezuelans and many Cubans who are afraid of dictatorships and socialism. Some conspiracy groups know this and then they use it to scare people,\u201d Calzadilla says.\n\nA good example is a YouTube campaign ad that the Trump campaign created in 2020 falsely claiming that the Venezuelan government supported Joe Biden. According to nonprofit newsroom ProPublica, the video was watched more than 100,000 times in Florida in the nine days leading up to the 2020 presidential election. Venezuelan president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro didn\u2019t endorse any of the candidates. But some voters may have believed what they saw.\n\nOther narratives that prey on Latino communities have to do with inflation (targeted at Argentinians and Venezuelans), abortion and reproductive rights (most Latin Americans are Catholic), and the shadow of electoral fraud or rigged elections (something that has happened in the past in Honduras, Nicaragua, Ecuador, and many other countries).\n\n\u201cThis kind of disinformation is targeted at the Latino community who don\u2019t speak English,\u201d says Calzadilla. \u201cWe understand that Spanish speakers in the United States are more vulnerable than others because they do not have the same sources [as English speakers] to inform themselves.\u201d\n\nWhile many young Latinos consume news in English, over 15 million American households are Spanish-speaking, and at least three million of those households are \u201climited English speaking,\u201d according to the Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey. This means that a significant portion of the Latino population in the US consumes Spanish-language content.\n\nSam Woolley, director of the propaganda research lab at the Center for Media Engagement at the University of Texas, has also seen these narratives adapt towards particular populations. The Center, which has worked with multiple and diverse Latino communities across the US, looks at how this segment of the population is exposed to manipulative content.\n\n\u201cOne critical thing to understand is that a lot of the campaigns we see are micro-targeted at specific subsections of the Latino population in specific geographies and they speak about issues that are specifically relevant to those communities,\u201d he explains.\n\nSome narratives, however, transcend sub-communities to target the wider Spanish-speaking electorate. According to Calzadilla, one of the most prominent ones is the alleged electoral fraud in 2020 and the so-called illegal migrant invasion. Ronny Rojas who leads Tverifica, Telemundo\u2019s fact-checking initiative, agrees and says he\u2019s often seen immigration messages, including some using false or misleading data to draw a link between increased immigration and criminality. While a number of Latinos in the US are immigrants themselves or come from immigrant families, many of them oppose what they see as the onslaught of illegal immigration coming from the southern border. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of rejection from at least a part of the Latino community towards this type of migration,\u201d he explains. \u201cWe are seeing that now because the issue of migration has become a central point in this campaign.\u201d\n\nHe speculates that these narratives are not just created to persuade voters but to create confusion amongst them. \u201cBy generating more confusion, it adds to the discussions about immigration,\u201d Rojas says. \u201cThe strongest narratives in the last few years are that migrants exploit the benefits system, which is not the case.\u201d\n\nWho spreads these false narratives?\n\nAs the Republican primary was starting to heat up in 2023, Ron DeSantis\u2019 campaign shared a video criticising Trump for not firing Anthony Fauci from his role in the COVID-19 taskforce. The video included fake AI-generated images of Trump hugging and kissing Fauci. While this example and the one above connecting Maduro to Biden come directly from the Republican camp, can we say that Republicans are more likely to spread disinformation to Latinos than Democrats? Not necessarily, but it manifests in different ways, Caldazilla says.\n\n\u201cSome conservative media outlets and radio stations in Miami spread conspiracy theories like the great replacement theory that says there is a plot to bring immigrants to vote and the \u2018big lie\u2019 [saying Trump won the 2020 election],\u201d she says. \u201c[Democrats] exaggerate how successful their administration is, but we are not seeing a lot of use of artificial intelligence to deceive people about a specific conspiracy theory.\u201d She says that Democrats are more likely to omit information that makes them look bad or inflate figures that make them look good, whereas Republicans are more likely to reference conspiracy theories.\n\nWoolley agrees that both parties are leveraging different tactics on social media to try to manipulate public opinion. He further explains the Democrats\u2019 general strategy, which involves the use of coordinated groups of political influencers who are paid to riff off a script without any disclosures. While Republicans also employ coordinated influencer campaigns, they are more willing to use botnets and disinformation to sway people\u2019s perspectives.\n\nWhile the origin of some of these lies is easy to track as they come from candidates themselves, most of the time it\u2019s not so cut and dry. Woolley says that campaigns often engage in what he calls \u2018identity laundering\u2019, with shadowy marketing firms often purposely created to just work during one election in one state for a specific campaign.\n\n\u201cIt is important for people to understand that it's often intermediaries and consulting groups that are doing this work,\u201d Woolley explains. \u201cThe United States still has several loopholes that allow campaigns to hire contractors, but then the contractors can hire subcontractors that can avoid having to list themselves as having worked for a political campaign.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s new in the age of AI?\n\nWoolley and his colleagues at the Center for Media Engagement have been tracking what they call computational propaganda (bots, algorithms and other forms of automation) since 2012. While the bot driven disinformation campaigns they saw in 2016 were rudimentary and repetitive, they still managed to manipulate algorithms and spread false and harmful content during the campaign.\n\n\u201cWhat generative AI does is putting computational propaganda on steroids,\u201d Woolley says. \u201cWith generative AI, campaigns are not only amplified to a higher degree. They're also much more persuasive, and much more nuanced.\u201d\n\nWhat does Woolley mean by this? As a social scientist who has studied computational manipulation in the political sphere for years, he often has trouble identifying images that have been doctored by AI. \u201cIf experts cannot distinguish between AI-created content, whether it's images, text, videos, and non-generic content, then what hope do regular voters have?\u201d he says.\n\nOne of the fact-checking initiatives from Telemundo\u2019s Tverifica is a WhatsApp channel where they can communicate directly with their audience. This service also allows users to send the team story ideas, and images and documents they want them to verify.\n\nRojas says that most of the content they are seeing being circulated are images generated by AI, an issue that did not exist in previous election cycles. \u201cYou see all kinds of things,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are images of politicians that you see in circumstances or in situations that did not occur, but I would not stop only at politics. In fact, images of all kinds are circulating massively.\u201d\n\nAn example Rojas gives is images of a newly discovered species of cat with a vibrant fur pattern that have been shared at least hundreds of times on Facebook and viewed thousands of times on TikTok. While this cat does not exist and its images were generated through AI, thousands of people have shared and commented believing it is real.\n\n\"You can say, 'well, that's a case that doesn't harm anyone' but in reality, if you analyse it, what is generated is a false belief in the existence of a breed of cat that is false and if you start to put together all these false publications, these images that are coming, that people are seeing, suddenly you realise that an important part of the information that people consume is false, it is nonexistent. So, in the end, this generates a false knowledge base,\u201d he says.\n\nAI-generated images are not the only ones making the rounds in the campaign trail. Right before the New Hampshire primary, residents of the state were receiving robocalls that used AI to mimic Biden\u2019s voice to discourage people from voting. Calzadilla says that they are seeing videos on Facebook of a fake Biden speaking Spanish and promoting a false executive order that would give free insurance to people earning less than $50,000.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned about that because now we are facing the first electoral process in the midst of the boom of generative artificial intelligence and I have started to see how electoral campaigns are using AI to deceive people without any transparency on the technology they use,\u201d she says.\n\nIn mid-February, several tech companies, including OpenAI, Meta, Google, TikTok, Microsoft and Amazon, signed a pledge vowing that they would combat the creation and the spread of AI-generated content from interfering with elections across the globe. But their pledge is lacking in details on how they will achieve this goal.\n\nWhat to expect from the election\n\nWith the 2024 election cycle already ramping up, media organisations are preparing for what is coming ahead.\n\nTelemundo is hiring one to two additional fact-checkers as well as establishing strategic alliances with other media organisations. For example, they have partnered with media literacy outfit MediaWise to produce a series of educational videos with Telemundo\u2019s news anchors to help people identify false information.\n\n\u201cWe did a series of videos and a course that people could follow online at their own pace to protect themselves from fake news online,\u201d explains Rojas. They are hoping to produce similar videos for other platforms like TikTok so they can reach other types of audiences.\n\nFactchequeado is building partnerships with media organisations around the country which includes an amalgamation of newspapers, local TV and radio stations, and digital news outlets. These organisations are not only Spanish-language outlets but also English-language outlets aimed at the Hispanic community in the country. This allows them to spread their fact-checking to all corners of the US. These news organisations, including the Dallas Morning News, El Nuevo Georgia News, and Qu\u00e9 Hay De Nuevo New Hampshire, can publish everything they produce free of charge.\n\n\u201cWe started in April 2022, with seven allies in different cities and right now we have more than 60 media outlets,\u201d says Calzadilla. Factchequado, a brainchild born out of a collaboration between Spain\u2019s Maldita.es and Argentina\u2019s Chequeado, gets to fund its team of 14 through a variety of grants from organisations such as Open Society Foundation and Google News Initiative.\n\nWhile the work of these organisations is necessary when it comes to protecting Latino communities from the onslaught of disinformation, there is a limit to what can be done without the input of the platforms where these falsehoods spread. \u201cMany studies show that social media platforms do not, at least here in the US, do the same thorough job in cleaning up misinformation in Spanish as they do in English,\u201d says Rojas. \u201cSo that makes Latinos especially vulnerable to disinformation.\u201d\n\nFor example, a study by human rights non-profit Avaaz showed that 70% of COVID-19 misinformation in English ended up flagged with warning labels on Facebook. By contrast, only 30% of COVID-19 misinformation in Spanish was flagged. In her testimony before Congress, Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen said that the company spends 87% of its budget for combating misinformation on English language content despite the fact that only 9% of its users were English-speaking at the time.\n\nAccording to research firm Equis Research, 47% of Latino voters \u201coften\u201d use YouTube as a news source in a typical week. WhatsApp (and Facebook to a lesser extent) also constitute a source of information.\n\nThe EU\u2019s Digital Services Act requires platforms to be transparent in their content moderation, including disclosing the human resources allocated to content moderation, categorised according to each of the official languages of the EU. The latest reports reveal positive strides from Meta in Europe with 163 moderators for Spanish versus 109 for English, according to the company's own 2023 figures. Meta specifies that for languages like Spanish which are widely spoken outside of the EU, they have additional content reviewers but those numbers are not publicly available. YouTube, however, has over 15,000 moderators for their English-language content versus 507 for Spanish, according to the company\u2019s own 2023 figures.\n\n\u201c[Platforms] have a responsibility to their users and to the countries they operate in to uphold the governance systems that they\u2019ve benefited from,\u201d affirms Woolley. \u201cSo do the governments, and in particular groups in the United States like the Federal Elections Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, and the Securities and Exchange Commission, who have mandates to make sure the things they oversee are free and fair and actually democratic.\u201d\n\nWhile a lot of this false information originates and spreads through traditional social media outlets like Facebook and X, both Calzadilla and Rojas say that the most used platforms for Spanish-speakers are YouTube and WhatsApp, where posts that are already viral are amplified even further.\n\n\"In messaging services like WhatsApp it is very difficult to verify false information that\u2019s circulating,\" says Rojas. \"WhatsApp is super important in Latin America, which makes the information even go from one country to another: we get it from our moms to the United States and it goes back to Colombia or Costa Rica, for example. So there is an important flow that makes us Latinos much more vulnerable.\"\n\nWhile fact-checkers have debunked the conspiracy that Taylor Swift is a psy-op for the Democrats, Calzadilla says that images of the singer and other celebrities donning T-shirts against Trump quickly began to pop up. \u201cWe suspect that some were created by artificial intelligence,\u201d she says.\n\nCalzadilla and her colleagues first attempted to find the original images through a reverse image search, which quickly revealed that an actor simply photoshopped the celebrity\u2019s T-shirt to their liking. For the two celebrities whose original photos were not found, Barack Obama and Tom Hanks, the team analysed facial discrepancies and irregularities that revealed that the photos were indeed artificially generated. By that point, the independently circulated images were already seen thousands of times over X and TikTok.",

        "text": "RFK Jr picks California lawyer Nicole Shanahan as his running mate\nRFK Jr picks California lawyer Nicole Shanahan as his running mate\n\nReuters\n\nMs Shanahan, 38, the ex-wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin, has never before run for political office.\n\nMr Kennedy, an environmental lawyer, anti-vaccine activist and scion of America's most famous political dynasty, is running as an independent.\n\nNaming a VP pick is a prerequisite to be on the ballot in a number of states.\n\nThe Kennedy campaign has ruffled Democrats, who are concerned about its spoiler potential on President Joe Biden's re-election chances.\n\nOn Tuesday Mr Kennedy embraced that label, calling his campaign \"a spoiler for President Biden and for President Trump\" that will \"forge an unstoppable coalition of homeless Democrats and homeless Republicans\".\n\nThe Democratic National Committee has recently stepped up attacks on Mr Kennedy, arguing that his longshot third-party bid will only end up helping to elect the Republican candidate, Donald Trump.\n\nMs Shanahan was unveiled on Tuesday by Mr Kennedy at a rally in Oakland, California, where he described her as a \"fellow lawyer, a brilliant scientist, technologist, a fierce warrior mom\".\n\nShe has previously been a longtime Democratic donor and has already donated to Mr Kennedy's campaign. She said in her remarks that she was leaving the Democratic Party, because it had \"lost its way\" by focusing on \"elitism\" and \"winning at all costs\".\n\n\"I believe I am taking the best ideals and impulses with me,\" she said.\n\nMr Kennedy, 70, described his new running mate as someone with a deep inside knowledge of Big Tech, which he depicted as a threat to democracy.\n\nHe told the crowd he picked a younger running mate partly because he wants her to be a champion for millennial and Gen-Z Americans. He said those generations had lost hope for their future and no longer believe the political establishment has their best interests at heart.\n\nMr Kennedy was introduced at the event by his wife, Cheryl Hines, the star of HBO comedy Curb Your Enthusiasm.\n\nMr Kennedy previously challenged Mr Biden for the Democratic party's nomination, before launching an independent bid last October.\n\nNaming Ms Shanahan as his vice-presidential nominee will help his campaign clear the way for ballot access in many US states and Washington DC.\n\nGetty Images)\n\nHis campaign has to navigate a wide variety of state rules to get his name on the ballot.\n\nOn Monday, Mr Kennedy threatened legal action against Nevada after state officials suggested signatures his campaign has gathered to qualify for the ballot there could be invalid, as he had not confirmed a running mate at the time they were filed.\n\nSo far, Mr Kennedy is only confirmed to be on the ballot in Utah.\n\nMs Shanahan's humble origins will serve as a contrast to Mr Kennedy and his famous political family.\n\nThe daughter of a Chinese immigrant mother and a white father, she grew up in Oakland and was raised on food stamps, a federal subsidy that helps low-income families buy groceries.\n\nShe's previously recalled her childhood as being filled with fear and instability because of her dad's schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.\n\nMs Shanahan has supported criminal justice reform, affordable housing and efforts to fight climate change and to increase access to mental health treatment.\n\nShe is the founder and president of Bia-Echo Foundation, a charitable organisation focused on fertility and human health.\n\nIn February, Ms Shanahan acknowledged partially funding a Super Bowl ad released by Mr Kennedy's campaign.\n\nWatch: RFK Jr v JFK - can you spot the difference?\n\nThe ad was a remake of a 1960 one that was part of the White House campaign run by his uncle, President John F Kennedy.\n\nThe Super Bowl ad drew disapproval, including from members of RFK Jr's family, who criticised his vaccine scepticism.\n\nThe BBC spoke with half a dozen of Ms Shanahan's former and current colleagues before Tuesday's announcement.\n\nThey described her as a compassionate leader and a champion of social causes.\n\nWhile most did not realise she was considering a political career, they were surprised but not shocked to see her name floated as Mr Kennedy's vice-presidential nominee.\n\n\"She's motivated by trying to change things for the better and having an impact on social benefits,\" said Roland Vogl, executive director of Stanford University's Center for Legal Informatics, where Ms Shanahan has been a fellow.\n\nThey say her political inexperience and age should not count against her and that voters should be open to new leaders.\n\n\"Don't undersell someone who comes from outside a system to change the system,\" Bruce Cahan, a professional colleague, said.\n\nMr Kennedy's campaign previously floated other names on the running mate shortlist, including American football star Aaron Rodgers, former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura, and former Democratic presidential candidates Andrew Yang and Tulsi Gabbard.\n\nMr Kennedy has insisted he is unfazed by the political uphill battle he faces.\n\nThe last president to win without the backing of a major party was the first ever US president, George Washington.",

        "text": "RFK Jr. announces Nicole Shanahan as running mate for independent presidential bid\nRFK Jr. announces he is creating new party to get on California ballot in presidential run RFK Jr. announces he is creating new party to get on California ballot in presidential run 02:14\n\nOakland, California \u2014 Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced Tuesday that he is picking Nicole Shanahan, a donor and California-based attorney and entrepreneur, as his running mate in his long-shot independent bid for the White House.\n\nAt an event in Oakland, Kennedy introduced Shanahan as someone who \"who will speak for millennials and Gen Z. Someone who cares about healing our children, protecting our environment, restoring our soils, and getting the chemicals out of our food, and who understands how technology will either enslave us or give us a path back to freedom and prosperity.\"\n\nShanahan, 38, who is also known for her high-profile divorce from Google co-founder Sergey Brin, was thought to be a leading contender for Kennedy, particularly since the campaign will require substantial funding for its endeavors. She contributed $4 million to the Kennedy super PAC American Values 2024 and was involved in coordinating the production of an ad highlighting the Kennedy campaign, which aired during the Super Bowl.\n\nSo far, Kennedy is only on the general election ballot in Utah.\n\nThe pick comes one day after Kennedy's campaign threatened legal action against the Nevada Secretary of State's office over his petition to appear on the ballot after CBS News reported that the signatures he had gathered could be invalid because his petition did not include a vice presidential candidate.\n\nNicole Shanahan greets people as she becomes the vice presidential candidate of independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., in Oakland, California., U.S., March 26, 2024. Laure Andrillon / REUTERS\n\nDocuments requested from the Nevada office revealed that Kennedy only named himself, without a running mate, on his candidate petition, in violation of the rules, potentially making the signatures collected in the state void.\n\nThe secretary of state's office acknowledged its staff had misinformed Kennedy.\n\nThe Kennedy campaign said in a statement Tuesday that, now that it has announced a vice presidential pick, it will begin collecting signatures this week in 19 additional states that require a running mate for ballot access.\n\nThose states are: Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Vermont, Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.\n\nKennedy had earlier this month teased his vice-presidential announcement, putting forward some big names such as football star Aaron Rodgers and former Minnesota Jesse Ventura.\n\nHere are some of the names Kennedy had considered:\n\nAaron Rodgers, 40, is a professional football player for the New York Jets and aligns with Kennedy in his skepticism towards vaccine mandates. In 2021, Rodgers confirmed his unvaccinated status just days after testing positive for COVID-19, forcing him to sit out a Sunday football game against the Kansas City Chiefs. Kennedy told the New York Times earlier this month that Rodgers was a leading contender for the job.\n\nFormer Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, 72, was also mentioned by Kennedy as a top contender. Ventura, a former wrestler who won the governor's race as a Reform Party candidate, said he'd consider the job, though he disagreed with Kennedy's opposition to vaccines.\n\nFormer Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, 42, hasn't denied she was approached by Kennedy, but when asked on about it, only said, \"I'm gonna let Bobby Kennedy speak for himself. He's a good friend and I really love and respect him and his heart and why he's doing what he's doing.\" However, she spoke at CPAC in February and showered praise on former President Donald Trump.\n\nMike Rowe, 62, former host of \"Dirty Jobs\" TV series, told CNN that he received a call from Kennedy about being his running mate. He said they discussed vocational training and his foundation, mikeroweWORKS.\n\n\"At some point, he asked me if I would ever consider running for public office, and I spit my coffee back into my cup and I said, 'Seriously?'\"",

Millions of people took part in the election that went ahead without incident.\n\nState television RTS said that turnout was at around 71%.\n\nIf none of the 19 candidates secure over 50% of the votes, the election will go to a runoff.

        "text": "Non-White voters turn away from the Democratic Party [THE SELECTION - Special US Election]\nThere\u2019s an unprecedented realignment happening right now in American politics. And if you don\u2019t pay attention to it, you may be blindsided by quite a few developments in this election season for the US presidential campaign.\n\nIn a nutshell, American political observers used to believe that the Democratic party was the party of racial minorities. However, pre-election poll data for presidential elections suggests that non-white voters are increasingly turning to the Republican party. Both parties are splitting the vote 50/50 in 2024, whereas the Democrats had a 75-25 edge over Republicans as late as in 2020.\n\nThis is congruent with the fact that former president Trump\u2019s support from blue-collar jobs is driving the candidate\u2019s momentum in the polls. Education has become a better litmus test than race or income when it comes to voting behavior in the United States. The political lines in the US are therefore shifting towards a more unpredictable electoral future. The ultimate outcome of this election is anyone\u2019s guess at this point.\n\nBy Jeremy Ghez, HEC Paris Professor of Economics and International Affairs. He is a specialist in geopolitics and American politics. He has covered previous US presidential elections for HEC and major international media.\n\nSources:\n\nThe Parties on the Eve of the 2016 Election: Two Coalitions, Moving Further Apart. Trends in voter party affiliation 1992-2016, Pew Research Center, September 13, 2016\n\nAhead of the [2016] presidential election, the demographic profiles of the Republican and Democratic parties are strikingly different.

Further, there\u2019s the significant question of whether a second Trump presidency would threaten the rule of law in the US, and indeed democracy itself.\n\n\u2018The answer is definitely yes\u2019, says Anne Ramberg, Co-Chair of the IBA\u2019s Human Rights Institute Council. \u2018The problem with Trump and other autocrats is not only that they do not respect democracy built on the rule of law. Trump and his like-minded use democracy to demolish the democratic state built on the rule of law.\u2019\n\nAssessing the courts as bulwark\n\nThe US Supreme Court recently rejected a bid in Colorado to prevent Trump from being on the ballot in the state under the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution, which prohibits anyone who has engaged in \u2018insurrection\u2019 from holding future office. In a unanimous decision, the Court reasoned that states cannot be allowed to bar candidates from federal office because the effect would be a patchwork that would disenfranchise voters nationally. Rather, it should be up to Congress and the federal judiciary to enforce the disqualification clause of the 14th Amendment. The Court didn\u2019t rule on the question of whether or not Trump engaged in \u2018insurrection\u2019.\n\n\u2018This is one of those rare, unanimous opinions. And that\u2019s in part because of the concern for there being a patchwork of disenfranchisement if they were to rule in favour of Colorado. There was probably also a little undercurrent of the need to show some unity and not divide on political lines\u2019, says Laura Prather, Scholarship Officer for the IBA North American Regional Forum and a partner at law firm Haynes Boone in Austin, Texas.\n\nAttorney General Letitia James holds a press conference following a ruling against former US President Donald, New York City, US, 16 February 2024. REUTERS/David Dee Delgado The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in April on Trump\u2019s claim that, as a former president, he is immune from prosecution for the events of 6 January 2021, when a mob of his supporters overran the US Capitol to block Joe Biden from taking power. Trump faces four felony charges in US District Court in Washington, DC, for his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. He denies wrongdoing. The trial was scheduled to start in March but has been delayed while the Supreme Court addresses Trump\u2019s legally creative claim that as a former president he has absolute immunity. The high court has narrowed the constitutional question to: \u2018Whether and if so to what extent does a former President enjoy presidential immunity from criminal prosecution for conduct alleged to involve official acts during his tenure in office\u2019. Lower courts have already ruled that Trump was engaged in political activity, not official action as he claims, on 6 January 2021.\n\nTrump and his like-minded use democracy to demolish the democratic state built on the rule of law Anne Ramberg\n\nCo-Chair, IBA\u2019s Human Rights Institute Council\n\nWhile the Supreme Court appears to be arrayed against Trump\u2019s claim, its intervention serves to push a trial \u2013 if there is to be one \u2013 closer to November\u2019s election. A ruling on Trump\u2019s immunity claim wouldn\u2019t be expected before May or June, meaning an actual trial could begin in July or August at the soonest part.\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, criminal cases pending against Trump elsewhere have also been delayed. In Florida, where Trump faces 40 felony charges related to his alleged mishandling of secret US documents, Judge Eileen Cannon has pushed the trial start date to 20 May and signalled that it\u2019ll probably be delayed further. Trump has pleaded not guilty in the case.\n\nE Jean Carroll, former US President Donald Trump rape accuser, departs Manhattan Federal Court as the civil case goes into deliberations, in New York City, US, 8 May 2023. REUTERS/David Dee Delgado If Trump were to win re-election, he would be in position as President to order the Department of Justice to terminate both the election interference and classified documents criminal cases against him. Indeed, he has promised to go further by pardoning his supporters who rioted at the US Capitol on 6 January 2021, calling them \u2018patriots\u2019 and political \u2018hostages\u2019. And Trump has threatened to weaponise the Department of Justice and prosecute his political enemies if he regains power. Elsewhere, the start of a criminal trial in New York stemming from hush money payments allegedly made by Trump to a former adult film star, Stormy Daniels, during the 2016 presidential campaign has been delayed and will now begin on 15 April. Trump has denied any relationship with Daniels and disavowed knowledge of the hush money scheme. And in Georgia, a sweeping set of election fraud charges brought by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis related to allegations that Trump attempted to overturn the 2020 election have been delayed. A Georgia state court has been forced to wade through conflict-of-interest claims against Willis, who has admitted to a romantic relationship with one of the special prosecutors she assigned to the case. It\u2019s unclear when the trial may start. Willis and the special prosecutor deny allegations that they have violated conflict-of-interest laws or have misused funds. Trump and his co-defendants, meanwhile, have pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\n\u2018Trump, particularly in his second nomination and second run at the White House, represents the biggest challenge to laws that apply to leaders in the United States that we\u2019ve seen, certainly in living memory, and perhaps ever outside the context of the Civil War\u2019, says Scott Anderson, a fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution and a senior fellow in the National Security Law Program at Columbia Law School.\n\n\u2018We have a situation where the bigger questions are, what happens when Trump becomes the president if he is convicted, or if he\u2019s still under indictment. There\u2019s no real clear precedent or law that governs what happens in that scenario\u2019, Anderson says. Worse, \u2018he almost certainly will still be under indictment in some of these cases that have not gone to trial yet\u2019.\n\nWhat happens when Trump becomes the president if he is convicted, or if he\u2019s still under indictment [\u2026] there\u2019s no real clear precedent or law that governs what happens Scott Anderson\n\nFellow in Governance Studies, Brookings Institution\n\nDespite the delays in criminal proceedings, Trump has faced some measure of accountability in civil suits that have been brought against him. New York Attorney General Letitia James won a conviction against Trump and his organisation for inflating the value of his real estate holdings to New York banks and insurance companies. Trump is appealing the judgment. But his lawyers told a New York appeals court in March that he was unable to post the required bond covering the $454m penalty. The bond amount was later reduced to $175m.\n\nIn another case, Trump was ordered to pay writer E Jean Carroll nearly $90m in two verdicts for defamation and sexual assault. She successfully claimed in court that he sexually assaulted her in the changing room of a Manhattan clothing store in the mid-1990s. Trump has said he\u2019ll appeal.\n\nAll this has left Trump scrambling to raise cash both to pay his legal bills and to fund his campaign for the White House. Trump has been hosting Republican billionaires for private dinners at his Mar-a-Lago resort, according to reports, and has taken over control of the Republican National Committee (RNC), the party\u2019s fundraising arm, by installing his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, as RNC co-chair.\n\nThe rise of US authoritarianism\n\nWhile it\u2019s early in the election campaign, polls show Joe Biden and Trump roughly even in public support. \u2018There\u2019s a lot to worry about Donald Trump and the Republican Party because the party has been taken over by Trump\u2019s populist base. And it is a populism driven by anger and grievance against the existing system, which is our democratic system\u2019, says Terry Moe, a professor of political science at Stanford University.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a backlash by millions of people against social change that they find threatening\u2019, he says. According to Moe, many of Trump\u2019s supporters \u2018think that democracy as it currently exists, including basic democratic norms and procedures, don't work and they yearn for a strong man who can act unilaterally on their behalf. They are intensely anti-system and very open to the kind of authoritarian behaviours that Donald Trump engages in\u2019. What Trump and his allies refer to as \u2018the Deep State\u2019 is actually the administrative agencies and programmes of the US government that have been created by Congress in law. Increasingly, over the past three decades, at least since the election of firebrand Newt Gingrich as Speaker of the House in 1994, some legislators have viewed politics as a form of war without blood. They have demonised opponents as enemies and sought to hobble the federal government by starving it of revenue, for example by deauthorising agencies. To some extent, Congress, the courts and the existing body of US law have served as guardrails against attempts at deconstructionism. But what Trump is now promising, if he were to be re-elected, is to go much further by making law unilaterally rather than going through the usual democratic procedures in Congress. Pro-Trump protesters storm the US Capitol to contest the 2020 US presidential election results by the US Congress, Washington, DC, 6 January 2021. REUTERS/Ahmed Gaber\n\nTrump allies and a broad sweep of conservative political groups in the US have adopted what they are calling \u2018Project 2025\u2019 \u2013 a detailed agenda to fire tens of thousands of civil servants in the US bureaucracy and replace them with appointees loyal to Trump. It\u2019s a deceptively radical plan that would push presidential power beyond its present legal limits to effectively sabotage government agencies and programmes from the inside, making it impossible for them to pursue their lawful missions.\n\n\u2018We should take him at his own word, which is that a second term will be as he puts it, a moment of retribution, where he will again in his own words, rather gleefully lay claim to the powers of a dictator\u2019, says William Howell, the Sydney Stein Professor in American Politics at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy. \u2018At a re-election, he will claim \u2013 and not unjustifiably \u2013 a popular mandate to push back against democracy, and small \u201cd\u201d democratic checks that are meant to limit the exercise of presidential powers. He\u2019s been completely forthright about what he intends to do. This is not a case of a would-be autocrat hiding his ambition.\u2019\n\nInternational ramifications\n\nOne arena in which a second Trump presidency holds important ramifications for the rest of the world is international trade. Trump\u2019s populist appeal makes trade, particularly with China, a potential target. Antitrade messaging is popular in US Rust Belt states such as Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin that are key to any electoral victory. \u2018Let\u2019s say Trump wins, he\u2019s said flat out we can expect a continuation of the tariff battles that he started. We can expect a continuation of his focus on the bilateral trade deficit with China\u2019, says Raj Bhala, Diversity Equity and Inclusion Officer on the IBA International Trade and Customs Law Committee and a professor of international trade law at Kansas University.\n\nWe can expect a continuation of the tariff battles that Trump started. We can expect a continuation of his focus on the bilateral trade deficit with China Raj Bhala\n\nDiversity Equity and Inclusion Officer, IBA International Trade and Customs Law Committee\n\nThe former president is threatening to impose a 60 per cent tariff on Chinese goods and revoke his country\u2019s grant of Permanent Normal Trade Relations with the country. Trump can do neither legally without action by Congress, but it\u2019s perceived that he\u2019ll still try.\n\n\u2018We can expect him to continue the Biden administration battle fronts on not only semiconductor chips, but also industrial policy where we give subsidies to build facilities like Intel was going to do in Ohio and Taiwan Semiconductor said they\u2019ll do in Arizona\u2019, Bhala says. \u2018We know Trump loves onshoring, or at worst \u201cfriend-shoring\u201d\u2019 \u2013 a term defined by the World Economic Forum as a \u2018trade practice where supply chain networks are focused on countries regarded as political and economic allies.\u2019\n\nWe can also expect, believes Bhala, an increased use of presidential powers with respect to trade, to block or question imports and foreign direct investment. That\u2019ll translate to more use of \u2018national security\u2019 as a rationale to protect US companies and industries using authority found in US trade laws. A Trump administration can also be expected to vigorously enforce anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws as well as anti-circumvention measures at the border. In truth, Biden would also be expected to employ \u2018national security\u2019 as a trade barrier.\n\nFurther, the US has increasingly used trade and economic sanctions to advance foreign policy and national security goals, says Audi Syarief, Chair of the IBA Export Controls, Sanctions and Anti-Corruption Subcommittee and a member of Gibson Dunn\u2019s International Trade Practice Group in Washington, DC.\n\nRegardless of who the next president is, we will probably \u2018see an escalation\u2019 in the use of sanctions, Syarief says. The difference is that there\u2019s a greater chance that Trump, if elected, will impose sanctions through unilateral action rather than in multilateral coordination with allies. That can create \u2018dissonance\u2019 with the sanction regimes of other countries, Syarief warns. Unilateral sanctions \u2018create challenges that can potentially also create tension between us and our allies to the extent we\u2019re not aligned\u2019, Syarief says.\n\nWilliam Roberts is a US-based freelance journalist and can be contacted at wroberts3@me.com",

        "text": "What Can the Next President of Mexico Offer Her Constituents in the United States?\nBoth Claudia Sheinbaum and X\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez have gone on tour in the United States since their campaigns began, both courting the votes of the millions of Mexican nationals living on the northern side of the border. The National Electoral Institute (INE) has continued to expand the ways that Mexican nationals can vote while abroad, hoping to both increase turnout and make Mexican nationals feel more connected to their country of origin despite living in the United States and, in the case of people without authorized immigration status, being unable to visit Mexico and subsequently return to their home in the US.\n\nThe discourse of the Morena government has done far more to recognize Mexican nationals than previous governments have. Both Morena\u2019s founder, President Andres Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador (AMLO), and its current presidential candidate, Sheinbaum, have praised emigrants for their contributions to the Mexican economy in the form of remittances, while also celebrating that more and more migrants have been returning to Mexico in the past decade. This discourse is in line with the general emphasis that Morena has on centering the most economically vulnerable. Mexicans who leave for the United States without authorized immigrant status tend to be those seeking to escape economic precarity, making them an important part of the population that Morena was founded on trying to reach.\n\nWhile the recognition and praise as \u201cHeroes Paisanos\u201d (\u201cCompatriot Heroes\u201d) is nice and might in and of itself be helpful for winning consular votes, what concrete benefits can the Mexican government offer its emigrant constituents? Expansion of consular services can go a long way without causing much political controversy. Mexican consulates already offer a much more expansive set of services than any other country with comparable numbers of immigrants in the United States, specifically when it comes to monitoring and supporting Mexican nationals in their interactions with US law enforcement, but getting a passport or consular ID appointment can feel impossible. Not having a valid photo ID presents a wide array of impediments to basic mobility and access to services, and for many Mexican nationals without immigration status in the US, a passport or consular ID is their only option. Resources invested in expanding access to these appointments can provide a simple but necessary lifeline for unauthorized immigrants who do not have another way to acquire a valid photo ID.\n\nRecently, however, AMLO has been pushing for far more ambitious and impactful plans. His government has cooperated extensively with the Biden Administration on matters ranging from accepting people who have been removed from the United States and securitizing the Mexican-Guatemalan border, and is now seeking a broad package of benefits from the US in exchange. Among his ideas are a $20 billion Marshall Plan-style investment in Latin America, the removal of the Cuban Blockade and sanctions on Venezuela, and, most consequentially for migrants, a mass immigration status regularization program for people from Latin America who have been living and working in the United States for 10 years or more, commonly known as amnesty.\n\nAs far-fetched as any form of amnesty seems in the current US political environment, relief for unauthorized immigrants who meet certain requirements is an idea that has been present throughout the history of immigration policy. Traditionally, amnesty has been offered as a counterweight to increases in enforcement in other areas of immigration law, as was the case in the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act that granted a path to Permanent Residence and subsequently Citizenship to almost three million qualifying immigrants. Since then, narrower forms of permanent or temporary legal forgiveness of unauthorized status have taken effect to protect certain nationalities or, in the case of DACA, people who were brought to the country as children, from deportation. These more recent protections have been the result of administrative adjustments and have not been codified by Congress, meaning they remain vulnerable to changes in administration or challenges in the courts. In the years since the creation of the Department of Homeland Security in 2003 and the placement of immigration enforcement within it, dramatically increasing securitization and detention of immigrants have far outpaced any new forms of relief. The result has been a bloated system that inflicts more punishment for lesser offenses at enormous human and economic costs, enriching security contractors and smugglers while cutting off opportunities for immigrants to build lives for themselves through formal channels.\n\nIt is long past time to counter the mass securitization of immigration policy with new paths to authorized status, and the Morena government has every right to continue to use its leverage to press for amnesty wherever possible. Beyond the obvious humanitarian benefits to the recipients of regularized immigration status, amnesty has a host of benefits for both the US and Mexico as a whole. Immigration from Mexico to the US has also been hovering around a net-zero rate for years. Many more Mexican nationals would be free to go back and forth if they knew that they were not jeopardizing their ability to re-enter the United States by doing so, enabling them to contribute to their communities on both sides of the border. Authorized status would also allow Mexican nationals to legally work in the United States, which would increase both formal domestic production in the US and potential remittances that boost the Mexican economy.\n\nIf they continue to push for this relief until some form of it is granted, AMLO and Sheinbaum will succeed in widely expanding not only their party\u2019s voter base but also their economic and cultural impact as Mexican nationals in the United States are afforded the opportunity to formally contribute to the well-being of both nations.",

        "text": "Q&A: 2024 Election Coverage Prompting Burnout? You're Not Alone\nDo you feel this election and news cycle is different from others in the past? How is coverage changing? We already know who the nominees will be. There hasn\u2019t been as much traditional activity as there has been in the past. Much news is focused on people leaving Congress due to its dysfunction, causing anxiety about the direction of the Congress in the future. Also, we now accept extreme viewpoints and hear them constantly. I think this causes a lot of concern. This has resulted in much apathy among voters. There is much concern that many people will not vote. The ever-increasing amount of political social media spots causes one to tune out as they are inundated with requests. I get lots of emails and texts from candidates all over the country that I know nothing about.\n\nWhat can constant exposure to this coverage do to us? People generally react in two distinct ways: One is to become more anxious and worried about the country\u2019s future, and two is to tune out and become disinterested and simply escape the issues.\n\nHow widespread is election fatigue? Most people I talk with are not paying much attention given the current reality of the nominees being set. They have yet to pay attention to the local primaries as again, most are already settled. Social media is the primary culprit in tuning out.\n\nWhat can happen if we chose to avoid media altogether, or are selective about our sources? For many, it is too early to get immersed in the media. Selecting one\u2019s sources can be quite problematic and can result in poor decision-making regarding elections. It becomes a type of group think that causes one\u2019s judgement to turn off. There are several studies demonstrating that increasing peoples\u2019 awareness using various sources changes their opinion. I have seen this firsthand with family members.\n\nWhat are some ways to avoid apathy and stay engaged? Focus on issues that are important to you. What creates fire in your belly or keeps you up at night. It could be healthcare, tax reform, the environment, etc. And do what you can to support your position.\n\nWhat advice do you have for the well-informed among us who choose to remain disengaged due to burnout? I think similar to above. What is the issue that is most important to you? It could be local issues, such as the unhoused, water issues, etc. Just find that thing, and focus on it.",

        "text": "State Bar Court Hearing Judge Recommends John Eastman's Disbarment\nState Bar Court Hearing Judge Recommends John Eastman's Disbarment\n\nIn a 128-page ruling, California State Bar Court Hearing Judge Yvette D. Roland found licensee John Charles Eastman (SBN 193726) culpable of 10 of the disciplinary charges filed by the State Bar\u2019s Office of Chief Trial Counsel (OCTC) and recommended that he be disbarred. Absent a challenge, the recommendation goes to the California Supreme Court for review.\n\nAs is the case for all State Bar Court disbarment recommendations, Eastman is ordered by the court to involuntary inactive status and cannot practice law in California while the Supreme Court considers the case. The order to inactive status is effective three calendar days after the order is served.\n\n\u201cEvery California attorney has the duty to uphold the constitution and the rule of law,\u201d said Chief Trial Counsel George Cardona. \u201cMr. Eastman repeatedly violated that duty. Worse, he did so in a way that threatened the fundamental principles of our democracy. The substantial evidence presented over 35 days of trial showed, and the court has now held, that Mr. Eastman abandoned his ethical and legal duties as an attorney to conspire with then-President Donald Trump to develop and implement a strategy to obstruct the counting of electoral votes on January 6, 2021, and illegally disrupt the peaceful transfer of power to President-elect Joseph Biden, knowing that there was no good faith theory or argument to lawfully reject the electoral votes of any state or delay the January 6 electoral count. Mr. Eastman\u2019s efforts failed only because our democratic institutions and those committed to upholding them held strong. The harm caused by Mr. Eastman\u2019s abandonment of his duties as a lawyer, and the threat his actions posed to our democracy, more than warrant his disbarment.\u201d\n\nSummarizing the court\u2019s findings, the decision states, \u201cEastman\u2019s wrongdoing constitutes exceptionally serious ethical violations warranting severe professional discipline,\u201d and recommends his disbarment.\n\nIn March 2022, Chief Trial Counsel Cardona invoked a public protection waiver to announce an investigation of Eastman was underway. In January 2023, OCTC filed 11 disciplinary charges against Eastman, alleging that he engaged in misconduct to plan, promote, and assist then-President Trump in executing a strategy, unsupported by facts or law, to overturn the legitimate results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe hearing, which began in State Bar Court in June 2023, included more than 35 trial days extending into November, and involved 23 witnesses and more than 700 exhibits. The lead OCTC attorneys representing the State Bar were Duncan Carling, Samuel Beckerman, and Christina Wang.\n\nThe State Bar Court of California is the only independent court in the U.S. dedicated solely to attorney discipline. Attorney discipline matters are investigated and prosecuted by OCTC, acting on behalf of the public. The State Bar Court oversees disciplinary proceedings and adjudicates charges filed by OCTC. The court rules on whether OCTC has proved charges of professional misconduct by clear and convincing evidence and may recommend that an attorney be suspended or disbarred.\n\nIf a disciplinary ruling involves disbarment or suspension, the State Bar Court\u2019s recommendation is transmitted to the California Supreme Court, which determines whether to impose the recommended discipline. See rule 9.18, California Rules of Court.

Input either the case number or attorney\u2019s name (last, first middle).\n\n###\n\nFollow the State Bar online\n\nLinkedIn, X (Twitter), Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube\n\nThe State Bar of California's mission is to protect the public and includes the primary functions of licensing, regulation and discipline of attorneys; the advancement of the ethical and competent practice of law; and support of efforts for greater access to, and inclusion in, the legal system.",

He was a powerful legislator and his support was sought after in Washington.\n\n\"Senator Lieberman's love of God, his family, and America endured throughout his life of service in the public interest,\" his family said in its statement.\n\nA Democrat of long standing, he broke from his party ranks on several issues - including its opposition to the Iraq War. He won his final term in office in 2006 as an independent.\n\nIn recent years, he was known as the founding chairman of No Labels, a centrist political group that aimed to establish a third-party presidential ticket for the general election in 2024.\n\n\"Senator Lieberman was a singular figure in American political life who always put his country before party,\" No Labels said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nMr Lieberman made that clear in a recent interview with Bloomberg TV last week.\n\n\"Thomas Jefferson once said America will need a little political rebellion every now and then, which should be as important in politics as the storms are in the natural world,\" he said.\n\n\"And I think he meant to clear away the dead wood, and boy, does our political system need a good storm and a political rebellion right now.\"\n\nMr Lieberman was born in Stamford, Connecticut in 1942, and worked his way through state politics, serving as both a state senator and the state attorney general before launching himself to the US Senate in 1989.\n\nMr Lieberman was one of the most prominent Jewish politicians in the US during his career. His White House run with Mr Gore was a milestone for Jewish Americans and the former senator was public in the exercise of his faith.\n\nAs a moderate Democrat, Mr Lieberman developed a reputation in Washington for crossing party lines - as well as simply crossing members of his own party.\n\nIn 2000, Mr Gore selected Mr Lieberman as his running mate on the Democratic presidential ticket. They would go on to lose to Republican George W Bush and his vice-presidential pick, Dick Cheney, in one of the most contentious conclusions to a presidential election in American history.\n\nBut by 2008, Mr Lieberman was endorsing a Republican presidential candidate, the US Senator John McCain of Arizona, who was his close friend.\n\nMr McCain would ultimately lose to Barack Obama, America's first black president.\n\nAs a senator, Mr Lieberman also backed several progressive policies. He notably helped end the Pentagon's Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy, which barred LGBTQ people from openly serving in the military.",

        "text": "Changes to First Past the Post style Electoral College increase chances of Trump victory\nBarring an act of God, 5 November 2024 will see a rematch of the 2020 US Presidential election between Joe Biden and Donald Trump.\n\nLooking back at the nationwide result in 2020, you would be forgiven for thinking that Biden secured a relatively comfortable victory, winning 7 million more votes than Trump. Biden won over half the votes cast (51.3%), finishing 4.4 percentage points ahead of Trump (46.9%).\n\nHowever, unlike almost all other Presidential elections throughout the world, the US President is not elected via the popular vote. If they were, then Donald Trump would never have taken office. In 2016, Hillary Clinton received around 3 million more votes than Trump (48.0% to 45.9%).\n\nHow did Trump become President without ever winning the popular vote? The answer is the Electoral College (EC).\n\nThe First Past the Post style Electoral College\n\nEach state (and the District of Columbia) is allocated a number of EC votes, roughly in proportion to their population. The number of EC votes varies from 54 for California to three each for Alaska, Delaware, District of Columbia, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont and Wyoming. In order to become President, a candidate needs to reach 270 EC votes.\n\nAlmost every state applies a winner-takes-all approach to allocating their EC votes, which means, just like in First Past the Post, winning a state by a wide margin is of no extra benefit to a candidate than winning it by a narrow margin. Take the 2020 results from the two most populous states, California (55 Electoral College votes) and Texas (38 Electoral College votes). Biden won California by a margin of 5.1 million votes (63.5% to 34.3%), whereas Trump won Texas by a much smaller 631,000 votes (52.1% to 46.5%). However, no differentiation is made, the winner takes all of the EC votes in each state.\n\nIn 2020, Biden secured 306 EC votes to 232 EC votes for Trump (based on how the public voted on election day). Again, on paper, this looks like a fairly comfortable EC victory for Biden, but digging deeper into the state-by-state votes shows this was far from the case.\n\nThe three closest results were in states won by Biden by less than one percentage point \u2013 Wisconsin (Biden\u2019s majority = 20,682); Georgia (12,670); and Arizona (10,457). In order for Trump to become President again in 2024, all he has to do is flip these three states, which in 2020 had a combined Biden majority of just 43,809 votes. A drop in the ocean compared to the 7 million majority Biden enjoyed nationwide.\n\nChanges to the number of Electoral College votes each state has\n\nWinning these three states would give Trump an extra 37 EC votes. Added to the 232 EC votes he won in 2020, this would put him on 269 EC votes, still one short of an outright victory. However, the number of votes each state has is partially based on their populations. Due to population changes in the 2020 US Census, the number of EC votes assigned to each state has changed. Victory in these three states, plus the states he won in 2020, would put Trump across the winning line on 272 EC votes.\n\nFirst Past the Post means millions of votes don\u2019t matter\n\nThe Electoral College shares similar drawbacks to our winner-takes-all First Past The Post (FPTP) system used at UK general elections. Both create \u2018safe\u2019 seats, where everyone knows who is going to win before a single vote has been cast, meaning voters in these places are taken for granted. Candidates can pile up votes in these \u2018safe\u2019 seats, for no extra benefit, for example, of the ten largest majorities at the 2019 UK general election, nine were in urban, Labour-held seats in London and Merseyside.\n\nThey can both cause \u2018wrong winner\u2019 elections, for example neither Al Gore or Hilary Clinton became President, despite getting more votes than their opponents (George W Bush and Trump) in 2000 and 2016 respectively. While in the UK, in 1951, Labour got more votes than the Conservatives but the Tories won more seats. In February 1974, the position was reversed, with the Conservatives winning more votes but Labour gaining a higher number of seats.\n\nIt looks increasingly likely that the next UK general election will be held in the autumn of 2024, around the same time as the US Presidential election. Within a matter of weeks we will witness national elections held under electoral systems that are prone to producing random and volatile results. With such important issues at stake in both countries, the details of electoral systems really do matter. Voters deserve to have their votes properly represented.\n\nJoin the Electoral Reform Society\n\nFirst Past the Post isn\u2019t fit for purpose, in the UK or the USA.

Kennedy Jr. announced Tuesday that he is picking Nicole Shanahan, a donor and California-based attorney and entrepreneur, as his running mate in his long-shot independent bid for the White House.\n\nAt an event in Oakland, Kennedy introduced Shanahan as someone who \"who will speak for millennials and Gen Z. Someone who cares about healing our children, protecting our environment, restoring our soils, and getting the chemicals out of our food, and who understands how technology will either enslave us or give us a path back to freedom and prosperity.\"\n\nShanahan, 38, who is also known for her high-profile divorce from Google co-founder Sergey Brin, was thought to be a leading contender for Kennedy, particularly since the campaign will require substantial funding for its endeavors. She contributed $4 million to the Kennedy super PAC American Values 2024 and was involved in coordinating the production of an ad highlighting the Kennedy campaign, which aired during the Super Bowl.\n\nSo far, Kennedy is only on the general election ballot in Utah.\n\nThe pick comes one day after Kennedy's campaign threatened legal action against the Nevada Secretary of State's office over his petition to appear on the ballot after CBS News reported that the signatures he had gathered could be invalid because his petition did not include a vice presidential candidate.\n\nNicole Shanahan greets people as she becomes the vice presidential candidate of independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., in Oakland, California., U.S., March 26, 2024. Laure Andrillon / REUTERS\n\nDocuments requested from the Nevada office revealed that Kennedy only named himself, without a running mate, on his candidate petition, in violation of the rules, potentially making the signatures collected in the state void.\n\nThe secretary of state's office acknowledged its staff had misinformed Kennedy.\n\nThe Kennedy campaign said in a statement Tuesday that, now that it has announced a vice presidential pick, it will begin collecting signatures this week in 19 additional states that require a running mate for ballot access.\n\nThose states are: Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Vermont, Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.\n\nKennedy had earlier this month teased his vice-presidential announcement, putting forward some big names such as football star Aaron Rodgers and former Minnesota Jesse Ventura.\n\nHere are some of the names Kennedy had considered:\n\nAaron Rodgers, 40, is a professional football player for the New York Jets and aligns with Kennedy in his skepticism towards vaccine mandates. In 2021, Rodgers confirmed his unvaccinated status just days after testing positive for COVID-19, forcing him to sit out a Sunday football game against the Kansas City Chiefs. Kennedy told the New York Times earlier this month that Rodgers was a leading contender for the job.\n\nFormer Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, 72, was also mentioned by Kennedy as a top contender. Ventura, a former wrestler who won the governor's race as a Reform Party candidate, said he'd consider the job, though he disagreed with Kennedy's opposition to vaccines.\n\nFormer Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, 42, hasn't denied she was approached by Kennedy, but when asked on about it, only said, \"I'm gonna let Bobby Kennedy speak for himself. He's a good friend and I really love and respect him and his heart and why he's doing what he's doing.\" However, she spoke at CPAC in February and showered praise on former President Donald Trump.\n\nMike Rowe, 62, former host of \"Dirty Jobs\" TV series, told CNN that he received a call from Kennedy about being his running mate. He said they discussed vocational training and his foundation, mikeroweWORKS.\n\n\"At some point, he asked me if I would ever consider running for public office, and I spit my coffee back into my cup and I said, 'Seriously?'\"",

        "text": "The authoritarian threat to America\nThe authoritarian threat to America\n\nAn explosion caused by a police munition is seen while supporters of US President Donald Trump riot in front of the US Capitol Building in Washington, DC, 6 January 2021. Reuters/Leah Millis\n\nWith Donald Trump on track to become the Republican Party\u2019s nominee for US president, Global Insight considers what a second presidential term would mean for the rule of law in the US.\n\nDonald Trump is on track to secure the Republican Party\u2019s nomination for US president, even as he faces multiple criminal charges and civil complaints. It\u2019s an unprecedented and, to many legal observers, alarming circumstance, as America looks towards its national elections in November 2024.\n\nCommentators question how it\u2019s possible that a politician who has demonstrated a clear disregard for law and the courts can be allowed to run for the highest office in the world\u2019s oldest democracy. Further, there\u2019s the significant question of whether a second Trump presidency would threaten the rule of law in the US, and indeed democracy itself.\n\n\u2018The answer is definitely yes\u2019, says Anne Ramberg, Co-Chair of the IBA\u2019s Human Rights Institute Council. \u2018The problem with Trump and other autocrats is not only that they do not respect democracy built on the rule of law. Trump and his like-minded use democracy to demolish the democratic state built on the rule of law.\u2019\n\nAssessing the courts as bulwark\n\nThe US Supreme Court recently rejected a bid in Colorado to prevent Trump from being on the ballot in the state under the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution, which prohibits anyone who has engaged in \u2018insurrection\u2019 from holding future office. In a unanimous decision, the Court reasoned that states cannot be allowed to bar candidates from federal office because the effect would be a patchwork that would disenfranchise voters nationally. Rather, it should be up to Congress and the federal judiciary to enforce the disqualification clause of the 14th Amendment. The Court didn\u2019t rule on the question of whether or not Trump engaged in \u2018insurrection\u2019.\n\n\u2018This is one of those rare, unanimous opinions. And that\u2019s in part because of the concern for there being a patchwork of disenfranchisement if they were to rule in favour of Colorado. There was probably also a little undercurrent of the need to show some unity and not divide on political lines\u2019, says Laura Prather, Scholarship Officer for the IBA North American Regional Forum and a partner at law firm Haynes Boone in Austin, Texas.\n\nAttorney General Letitia James holds a press conference following a ruling against former US President Donald, New York City, US, 16 February 2024. REUTERS/David Dee Delgado The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in April on Trump\u2019s claim that, as a former president, he is immune from prosecution for the events of 6 January 2021, when a mob of his supporters overran the US Capitol to block Joe Biden from taking power. Trump faces four felony charges in US District Court in Washington, DC, for his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. He denies wrongdoing. The trial was scheduled to start in March but has been delayed while the Supreme Court addresses Trump\u2019s legally creative claim that as a former president he has absolute immunity. The high court has narrowed the constitutional question to: \u2018Whether and if so to what extent does a former President enjoy presidential immunity from criminal prosecution for conduct alleged to involve official acts during his tenure in office\u2019. Lower courts have already ruled that Trump was engaged in political activity, not official action as he claims, on 6 January 2021.\n\nTrump and his like-minded use democracy to demolish the democratic state built on the rule of law Anne Ramberg\n\nCo-Chair, IBA\u2019s Human Rights Institute Council\n\nWhile the Supreme Court appears to be arrayed against Trump\u2019s claim, its intervention serves to push a trial \u2013 if there is to be one \u2013 closer to November\u2019s election. A ruling on Trump\u2019s immunity claim wouldn\u2019t be expected before May or June, meaning an actual trial could begin in July or August at the soonest part.\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, criminal cases pending against Trump elsewhere have also been delayed. In Florida, where Trump faces 40 felony charges related to his alleged mishandling of secret US documents, Judge Eileen Cannon has pushed the trial start date to 20 May and signalled that it\u2019ll probably be delayed further. Trump has pleaded not guilty in the case.\n\nE Jean Carroll, former US President Donald Trump rape accuser, departs Manhattan Federal Court as the civil case goes into deliberations, in New York City, US, 8 May 2023. REUTERS/David Dee Delgado If Trump were to win re-election, he would be in position as President to order the Department of Justice to terminate both the election interference and classified documents criminal cases against him. Indeed, he has promised to go further by pardoning his supporters who rioted at the US Capitol on 6 January 2021, calling them \u2018patriots\u2019 and political \u2018hostages\u2019. And Trump has threatened to weaponise the Department of Justice and prosecute his political enemies if he regains power. Elsewhere, the start of a criminal trial in New York stemming from hush money payments allegedly made by Trump to a former adult film star, Stormy Daniels, during the 2016 presidential campaign has been delayed and will now begin on 15 April. Trump has denied any relationship with Daniels and disavowed knowledge of the hush money scheme. And in Georgia, a sweeping set of election fraud charges brought by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis related to allegations that Trump attempted to overturn the 2020 election have been delayed. A Georgia state court has been forced to wade through conflict-of-interest claims against Willis, who has admitted to a romantic relationship with one of the special prosecutors she assigned to the case. It\u2019s unclear when the trial may start. Willis and the special prosecutor deny allegations that they have violated conflict-of-interest laws or have misused funds. Trump and his co-defendants, meanwhile, have pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\n\u2018Trump, particularly in his second nomination and second run at the White House, represents the biggest challenge to laws that apply to leaders in the United States that we\u2019ve seen, certainly in living memory, and perhaps ever outside the context of the Civil War\u2019, says Scott Anderson, a fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution and a senior fellow in the National Security Law Program at Columbia Law School.\n\n\u2018We have a situation where the bigger questions are, what happens when Trump becomes the president if he is convicted, or if he\u2019s still under indictment. There\u2019s no real clear precedent or law that governs what happens in that scenario\u2019, Anderson says. Worse, \u2018he almost certainly will still be under indictment in some of these cases that have not gone to trial yet\u2019.\n\nWhat happens when Trump becomes the president if he is convicted, or if he\u2019s still under indictment [\u2026] there\u2019s no real clear precedent or law that governs what happens Scott Anderson\n\nFellow in Governance Studies, Brookings Institution\n\nDespite the delays in criminal proceedings, Trump has faced some measure of accountability in civil suits that have been brought against him. New York Attorney General Letitia James won a conviction against Trump and his organisation for inflating the value of his real estate holdings to New York banks and insurance companies. Trump is appealing the judgment. But his lawyers told a New York appeals court in March that he was unable to post the required bond covering the $454m penalty. The bond amount was later reduced to $175m.\n\nIn another case, Trump was ordered to pay writer E Jean Carroll nearly $90m in two verdicts for defamation and sexual assault. She successfully claimed in court that he sexually assaulted her in the changing room of a Manhattan clothing store in the mid-1990s. Trump has said he\u2019ll appeal.\n\nAll this has left Trump scrambling to raise cash both to pay his legal bills and to fund his campaign for the White House. Trump has been hosting Republican billionaires for private dinners at his Mar-a-Lago resort, according to reports, and has taken over control of the Republican National Committee (RNC), the party\u2019s fundraising arm, by installing his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, as RNC co-chair.\n\nThe rise of US authoritarianism\n\nWhile it\u2019s early in the election campaign, polls show Joe Biden and Trump roughly even in public support. \u2018There\u2019s a lot to worry about Donald Trump and the Republican Party because the party has been taken over by Trump\u2019s populist base. And it is a populism driven by anger and grievance against the existing system, which is our democratic system\u2019, says Terry Moe, a professor of political science at Stanford University.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a backlash by millions of people against social change that they find threatening\u2019, he says. According to Moe, many of Trump\u2019s supporters \u2018think that democracy as it currently exists, including basic democratic norms and procedures, don't work and they yearn for a strong man who can act unilaterally on their behalf. They are intensely anti-system and very open to the kind of authoritarian behaviours that Donald Trump engages in\u2019. What Trump and his allies refer to as \u2018the Deep State\u2019 is actually the administrative agencies and programmes of the US government that have been created by Congress in law. Increasingly, over the past three decades, at least since the election of firebrand Newt Gingrich as Speaker of the House in 1994, some legislators have viewed politics as a form of war without blood. They have demonised opponents as enemies and sought to hobble the federal government by starving it of revenue, for example by deauthorising agencies. To some extent, Congress, the courts and the existing body of US law have served as guardrails against attempts at deconstructionism. But what Trump is now promising, if he were to be re-elected, is to go much further by making law unilaterally rather than going through the usual democratic procedures in Congress. Pro-Trump protesters storm the US Capitol to contest the 2020 US presidential election results by the US Congress, Washington, DC, 6 January 2021. REUTERS/Ahmed Gaber\n\nTrump allies and a broad sweep of conservative political groups in the US have adopted what they are calling \u2018Project 2025\u2019 \u2013 a detailed agenda to fire tens of thousands of civil servants in the US bureaucracy and replace them with appointees loyal to Trump. It\u2019s a deceptively radical plan that would push presidential power beyond its present legal limits to effectively sabotage government agencies and programmes from the inside, making it impossible for them to pursue their lawful missions.\n\n\u2018We should take him at his own word, which is that a second term will be as he puts it, a moment of retribution, where he will again in his own words, rather gleefully lay claim to the powers of a dictator\u2019, says William Howell, the Sydney Stein Professor in American Politics at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy. \u2018At a re-election, he will claim \u2013 and not unjustifiably \u2013 a popular mandate to push back against democracy, and small \u201cd\u201d democratic checks that are meant to limit the exercise of presidential powers. He\u2019s been completely forthright about what he intends to do. This is not a case of a would-be autocrat hiding his ambition.\u2019\n\nInternational ramifications\n\nOne arena in which a second Trump presidency holds important ramifications for the rest of the world is international trade. Trump\u2019s populist appeal makes trade, particularly with China, a potential target. Antitrade messaging is popular in US Rust Belt states such as Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin that are key to any electoral victory. \u2018Let\u2019s say Trump wins, he\u2019s said flat out we can expect a continuation of the tariff battles that he started. We can expect a continuation of his focus on the bilateral trade deficit with China\u2019, says Raj Bhala, Diversity Equity and Inclusion Officer on the IBA International Trade and Customs Law Committee and a professor of international trade law at Kansas University.\n\nWe can expect a continuation of the tariff battles that Trump started. We can expect a continuation of his focus on the bilateral trade deficit with China Raj Bhala\n\nDiversity Equity and Inclusion Officer, IBA International Trade and Customs Law Committee\n\nThe former president is threatening to impose a 60 per cent tariff on Chinese goods and revoke his country\u2019s grant of Permanent Normal Trade Relations with the country. Trump can do neither legally without action by Congress, but it\u2019s perceived that he\u2019ll still try.\n\n\u2018We can expect him to continue the Biden administration battle fronts on not only semiconductor chips, but also industrial policy where we give subsidies to build facilities like Intel was going to do in Ohio and Taiwan Semiconductor said they\u2019ll do in Arizona\u2019, Bhala says. \u2018We know Trump loves onshoring, or at worst \u201cfriend-shoring\u201d\u2019 \u2013 a term defined by the World Economic Forum as a \u2018trade practice where supply chain networks are focused on countries regarded as political and economic allies.\u2019\n\nWe can also expect, believes Bhala, an increased use of presidential powers with respect to trade, to block or question imports and foreign direct investment. That\u2019ll translate to more use of \u2018national security\u2019 as a rationale to protect US companies and industries using authority found in US trade laws. A Trump administration can also be expected to vigorously enforce anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws as well as anti-circumvention measures at the border. In truth, Biden would also be expected to employ \u2018national security\u2019 as a trade barrier.\n\nFurther, the US has increasingly used trade and economic sanctions to advance foreign policy and national security goals, says Audi Syarief, Chair of the IBA Export Controls, Sanctions and Anti-Corruption Subcommittee and a member of Gibson Dunn\u2019s International Trade Practice Group in Washington, DC.\n\nRegardless of who the next president is, we will probably \u2018see an escalation\u2019 in the use of sanctions, Syarief says. The difference is that there\u2019s a greater chance that Trump, if elected, will impose sanctions through unilateral action rather than in multilateral coordination with allies. That can create \u2018dissonance\u2019 with the sanction regimes of other countries, Syarief warns. Unilateral sanctions \u2018create challenges that can potentially also create tension between us and our allies to the extent we\u2019re not aligned\u2019, Syarief says.\n\nWilliam Roberts is a US-based freelance journalist and can be contacted at wroberts3@me.com",

        "text": "Provisional ballots\nSince the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) became law in 2002, all states have been required to use provisional ballots. The only exception is states that offered same-day registration when the National Voter Registration Act was enacted in 1993, and even most of these states have found them useful in certain situations.\n\nIn its most basic form, a provisional ballot works like this: A voter whose name doesn\u2019t appear on the voter registration list at a precinct polling place on Election Day\u2014but who believes she or he is, in fact, registered\u2014may be offered a provisional ballot. After being marked, it's placed in a special secrecy envelope rather than in the ballot box. After the polls close, the registration status of the voter is determined. If the voter was in fact registered in that precinct on Election Day, the ballot is removed from the secrecy envelope and counted just like any other ballot. If the voter wasn\u2019t registered, the ballot remains in the secrecy envelope and is not counted.\n\nHow provisional ballots are implemented varies significantly across the states, reflecting differences in both state laws and cultural practices. While provisional ballots are intended as a method to ensure that no voter is turned away from the polls when there are questions about registration, there is still controversy over whether provisional ballot use is a positive or negative factor in election administration.\n\nThis explainer was last updated on March 27, 2024.",

In remarks, President Tsai thanked the US for including provisions to help bolster Taiwan's self-defense in the National Defense Authorization Act and for the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, which includes a budget for military assistance for Taiwan and prioritizes delivery of defense articles. The president said that going forward, Taiwan will continue to work with the US to expand cooperation within the global democratic community and thereby contribute even more to security, stability, and prosperity throughout the world.\n\nA translation of President Tsai's remarks follows:\n\nLet me begin by welcoming Chairman Bergman on another visit to Taiwan. This is the first time Chairman Bergman, Congressman Donald Norcross, and Congressman Jimmy Panetta are visiting Taiwan as US Congress members. Thank you all for demonstrating bipartisan US support for Taiwan through concrete action. Our guests today are key members of the House Armed Services Committee. They have long paid close attention to cross-strait issues and actively promoted cooperation and exchanges between Taiwan and the US in Congress so as to jointly safeguard regional peace and stability.\n\nIn recent years, Taiwan has continued to work toward self-sufficiency in national defense. Through programs to develop and produce indigenous aircraft and naval vessels, we are showing the world our commitment to self-defense and to safeguarding freedom and democracy. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the US government and Congress for including provisions to help bolster Taiwan's self-defense in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024 signed at the end of last year. Also, the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024 signed just this month includes a budget for military assistance for Taiwan and prioritizes delivery of defense articles. This support will help further strengthen the Taiwan-US partnership.\n\nIn addition to collaborating on security, Taiwan and the US have increased our economic and trade exchanges in recent years. I hope that our guests can continue to make the case to help resolve the Taiwan-US double taxation issue at the earliest possible juncture, which will facilitate even closer bilateral investment and industrial cooperation.\n\nIn closing, I welcome you all once again and hope that this trip helps deepen your understanding of Taiwan. Going forward, Taiwan will continue to work with the US to expand cooperation within the global democratic community and thereby contribute even more to security, stability, and prosperity throughout the world.\n\nChairman Bergman then delivered remarks, first thanking President Tsai for the hospitality. He said that as a delegation, their efforts here are to learn and to build a relationship, but also to seek to understand what next mutual steps are desired and possible.\n\nChairman Bergman stated that Taiwan is a key US partner in the Indo-Pacific, both through strong security cooperation and economic ties. Their delegation is here, he said, to show Congress's continued support for our partnership. He added that they will continue to assure their colleagues that this strategic relationship is key for the future security of the region, and said that includes a strong Taiwan maritime strategy and how we can work together on shared goals to counter China on their increasingly aggressive actions in the region.\n\nChairman Bergman mentioned that part of their visit here will be to spend time with US personnel to better understand how close the partnership is and what they can do to further the depth and understanding of the relationship as it evolves.\n\nThe delegation was accompanied to the Presidential Office by American Institute in Taiwan Taipei Office Director Sandra Oudkirk.",

        "text": "State Bar Court Hearing Judge Recommends John Eastman's Disbarment\nState Bar Court Hearing Judge Recommends John Eastman's Disbarment\n\nIn a 128-page ruling, California State Bar Court Hearing Judge Yvette D. Roland found licensee John Charles Eastman (SBN 193726) culpable of 10 of the disciplinary charges filed by the State Bar\u2019s Office of Chief Trial Counsel (OCTC) and recommended that he be disbarred. Absent a challenge, the recommendation goes to the California Supreme Court for review.\n\nAs is the case for all State Bar Court disbarment recommendations, Eastman is ordered by the court to involuntary inactive status and cannot practice law in California while the Supreme Court considers the case. The order to inactive status is effective three calendar days after the order is served.\n\n\u201cEvery California attorney has the duty to uphold the constitution and the rule of law,\u201d said Chief Trial Counsel George Cardona. \u201cMr. Eastman repeatedly violated that duty. Worse, he did so in a way that threatened the fundamental principles of our democracy. The substantial evidence presented over 35 days of trial showed, and the court has now held, that Mr. Eastman abandoned his ethical and legal duties as an attorney to conspire with then-President Donald Trump to develop and implement a strategy to obstruct the counting of electoral votes on January 6, 2021, and illegally disrupt the peaceful transfer of power to President-elect Joseph Biden, knowing that there was no good faith theory or argument to lawfully reject the electoral votes of any state or delay the January 6 electoral count. Mr. Eastman\u2019s efforts failed only because our democratic institutions and those committed to upholding them held strong. The harm caused by Mr. Eastman\u2019s abandonment of his duties as a lawyer, and the threat his actions posed to our democracy, more than warrant his disbarment.\u201d\n\nSummarizing the court\u2019s findings, the decision states, \u201cEastman\u2019s wrongdoing constitutes exceptionally serious ethical violations warranting severe professional discipline,\u201d and recommends his disbarment.\n\nIn March 2022, Chief Trial Counsel Cardona invoked a public protection waiver to announce an investigation of Eastman was underway. In January 2023, OCTC filed 11 disciplinary charges against Eastman, alleging that he engaged in misconduct to plan, promote, and assist then-President Trump in executing a strategy, unsupported by facts or law, to overturn the legitimate results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe hearing, which began in State Bar Court in June 2023, included more than 35 trial days extending into November, and involved 23 witnesses and more than 700 exhibits. The lead OCTC attorneys representing the State Bar were Duncan Carling, Samuel Beckerman, and Christina Wang.\n\nThe State Bar Court of California is the only independent court in the U.S. dedicated solely to attorney discipline. Attorney discipline matters are investigated and prosecuted by OCTC, acting on behalf of the public. The State Bar Court oversees disciplinary proceedings and adjudicates charges filed by OCTC. The court rules on whether OCTC has proved charges of professional misconduct by clear and convincing evidence and may recommend that an attorney be suspended or disbarred.\n\nIf a disciplinary ruling involves disbarment or suspension, the State Bar Court\u2019s recommendation is transmitted to the California Supreme Court, which determines whether to impose the recommended discipline. See rule 9.18, California Rules of Court. You can search more extensive State Bar Court records and documents related to this case, or any attorney discipline matters, using the court\u2019s Case Search feature. Input either the case number or attorney\u2019s name (last, first middle).\n\n###\n\nFollow the State Bar online\n\nLinkedIn, X (Twitter), Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube\n\nThe State Bar of California's mission is to protect the public and includes the primary functions of licensing, regulation and discipline of attorneys; the advancement of the ethical and competent practice of law; and support of efforts for greater access to, and inclusion in, the legal system.",

He was a powerful legislator and his support was sought after in Washington.\n\n\"Senator Lieberman's love of God, his family, and America endured throughout his life of service in the public interest,\" his family said in its statement.\n\nA Democrat of long standing, he broke from his party ranks on several issues - including its opposition to the Iraq War. He won his final term in office in 2006 as an independent.\n\nIn recent years, he was known as the founding chairman of No Labels, a centrist political group that aimed to establish a third-party presidential ticket for the general election in 2024.\n\n\"Senator Lieberman was a singular figure in American political life who always put his country before party,\" No Labels said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nMr Lieberman made that clear in a recent interview with Bloomberg TV last week.\n\n\"Thomas Jefferson once said America will need a little political rebellion every now and then, which should be as important in politics as the storms are in the natural world,\" he said.\n\n\"And I think he meant to clear away the dead wood, and boy, does our political system need a good storm and a political rebellion right now.\"\n\nMr Lieberman was born in Stamford, Connecticut in 1942, and worked his way through state politics, serving as both a state senator and the state attorney general before launching himself to the US Senate in 1989.\n\nMr Lieberman was one of the most prominent Jewish politicians in the US during his career. His White House run with Mr Gore was a milestone for Jewish Americans and the former senator was public in the exercise of his faith.\n\nAs a moderate Democrat, Mr Lieberman developed a reputation in Washington for crossing party lines - as well as simply crossing members of his own party.\n\nIn 2000, Mr Gore selected Mr Lieberman as his running mate on the Democratic presidential ticket. They would go on to lose to Republican George W Bush and his vice-presidential pick, Dick Cheney, in one of the most contentious conclusions to a presidential election in American history.\n\nBut by 2008, Mr Lieberman was endorsing a Republican presidential candidate, the US Senator John McCain of Arizona, who was his close friend.\n\nMr McCain would ultimately lose to Barack Obama, America's first black president.\n\nAs a senator, Mr Lieberman also backed several progressive policies. He notably helped end the Pentagon's Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy, which barred LGBTQ people from openly serving in the military.",

The fact that she is a newcomer to politics was seen as an asset by the coalition, which argued that this made it harder for her opponents to discredit her.\n\nBut when it came to registering her candidacy by the deadline set for Monday evening, however, the opposition coalition hit a wall.\n\nIn videos uploaded to social media, the PUD showed how they repeatedly tried and failed to log into the electoral council website to register Ms Yoris's candidacy.\n\nOne of the parties which forms part of the coalition, however, was granted an extension and was able to log into the system to register Mr Gonz\u00e1lez.\n\nA variety of other parties were also able to file candidates bringing the total number of presidential candidates to 13, but some of them are aligned to the government and are not thought to be serious challengers to President Maduro.\n\nThe PUD said in a statement that the candidacy of Mr Gonz\u00e1lez was \"provisional... given the clear impossibility of registering the chosen candidate so far\", suggesting the former diplomat was chosen as a placeholder.\n\nParties can make changes to their presidential ticket until 20 April and the opposition coalition is expected to replace him with a unity candidate.",

In fact, Poland has just celebrated 25 years of membership in NATO, a period that solidified Poland\u2019s return to the West and cemented strategic relations with the United States. Even when transatlantic relations were deeply strained, as during the Iraq war or Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, Polish-American ties remained a priority for Warsaw. Poland also stood out among European nations for maintaining robust ties with the United States during the Trump administration, primarily through the Law and Justice (PiS) party's prioritization of bilateral relations with Trump, often at the expense of relations with other European allies.\n\nHowever, perspectives in Warsaw are poised to shift because, with aid blocked in the House of Representatives, the United States appears to be unable to continue military support for Ukraine. Recently, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk even appealed directly to Speaker Mike Johnson in a tweet: \u201cLook at Odessa, Speaker Johnson! How many more arguments do you need to take a decision?\u201d Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski pointed out that when the commander-in-chief is unable to exercise his power and meet commitments to a partner because of opposition in Congress, the credibility of the United States suffers among its allies. Given Trump\u2019s control over the Republican Party, it is clear to Warsaw that US policy regarding European security is constrained even before the American public chooses its next president. The worries would only grow should Donald Trump secure reelection. These concerns are shared across the political spectrum in Poland.\n\nScenario 1: Trump 2.0\n\nConcerns in Warsaw stem mainly from two key pillars of Trump's announced policies. First, his reluctance to support Ukraine against renewed Russian aggression raises apprehension, given that Poland and neighboring states perceive this as an existential threat. The fear is that failure to support Ukraine could embolden Russia to pose a direct threat to NATO countries, including Poland. Second, Trump's critical stance on NATO raises alarms. Some in Warsaw think that Poland, having committed 4% of its GDP to defense, would be exempt from Trump's criticisms, or even that Trump would finally spur Western Europeans to spend more. However, this line of argument is outweighed by the concern for NATO\u2019s cohesion and the need to avoid potential fissures that Russia could then exploit.\n\nThe potential ramifications of a Trump presidency extend beyond the question of military aid to Ukraine. Trump's record of unpredictable behavior casts doubt on the United States\u2019 reliability as a NATO leader, prompting concerns about its credibility and its ability to confront adversaries. The recent obstructionism in the US House of Representatives on aid to Ukraine further underscores these concerns, eliciting sharp responses such as Prime Minister Donald Tusk's condemnation of Republican senators in a tweet not long before his visit to Washington on March 12: \u201cDear Republican Senators of America. Ronald Reagan, who helped millions of us to win back our freedom and independence, must be turning in his grave today. Shame on you.\u201d\n\nScenario 2: Biden 2.0\n\nMuch less discussed is the scenario of a second term for President Biden. On the surface, the general assumption is that the transatlantic alliance, and Polish-American relations, will largely continue on their current path. The recent election in Poland of a pro-democratic, pro-European coalition would make US-Polish relations even smoother than before, as there would be no tensions around values such as the rule of law, human rights, or relations with other important US allies in Europe such as Germany. But that picture obscures challenges that are likely to emerge in the transatlantic alliance even if Joe Biden wins this November.\n\nFirst, the United States is likely to have divided government under the Biden 2.0 scenario, with the Senate at least coming under Republican control. The experience of the last few months shows how effective a Republican-controlled chamber can be in frustrating the Biden administration\u2019s priorities on Ukraine, European security, and foreign policy more broadly.\n\nSecond, it is clear that the Indo-Pacific\u2014especially the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC)\u2014has become the predominant focus of US grand strategy. As the PRC builds up its capabilities, increasingly challenging the United States militarily\u2014even in the nuclear domain\u2014the Biden 2.0 administration would continue to move its strategic focus there, and away from Europe. US officials sometimes like to say that the United States \u201ccan walk and chew gum at the same time\u201d. But as global confrontations proliferate, often in an unexpected way\u2014as with the war in Gaza\u2014even the most pro-atlanticist administration will be unable to focus mainly on Europe. These two dynamics\u2014America\u2019s divided government and the strategic focus on Asia\u2014mean that at best, the shift in America\u2019s strategic focus will continue to drift toward the Indo-Pacific. At worst, a divided US government would mean a paralyzed US government. Both trends leave Poland and other European allies more exposed geopolitically.\n\nThe European Answer\n\nFor the reasons outlined above, Poland is increasingly looking to Europe to build up defense capabilities and a strategic culture that can take greater responsibility for European security in the years to come. The idea is not to replace the United States as a European power, or NATO as a primary organization for European security, but to create what Foreign Minister Sikorski has described as \u201cEuropean Harmony\u201d. In this situation, NATO, the EU, and member states would work more closely together on guarding European security, but without excluding the United States. In a conversation with GMF, former President of Poland Bronis\u0142aw Komorowski described this thinking best: \"It is not in Poland's interest to choose between the US and the European Union. It is in our interest that we never have to answer such a question.\"\n\nThe format that should spur this greater European strategic cooperation, according to new thinking in Warsaw, is the Weimar Triangle. Poland is finally able to step up here, thanks to the new government\u2019s pro-European credentials, and also because of the leadership vacuum resulting from the troubled German-French relationship. The logic is that in the short term, Weimar and European initiatives would fill the gap in support for Ukraine that has been created by Congressional inaction. Over the medium and long term, the ambition would be for Weimar and the EU as a whole to step up responsibility for European security and defense. As former President Komorowski remarked, \u201cPoland has an opportunity to become a key part of the engine of the European Union\u2014and this at a time when the transatlantic community may be going through a difficult period.\u201d How much time Europe would have to build up its capabilities and strategic culture depends on whether Biden or Trump wins in November. But even the most pro-European voices in Warsaw do not claim that Europe will be able to do this alone. The role that the United States plays in Europe when it comes to leadership, conventional capabilities, and the all-important nuclear umbrella is just too great to be replaced quickly\u2014no matter who occupies the White House next year.",

        "text": "Provisional ballots\nSince the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) became law in 2002, all states have been required to use provisional ballots. The only exception is states that offered same-day registration when the National Voter Registration Act was enacted in 1993, and even most of these states have found them useful in certain situations.\n\nIn its most basic form, a provisional ballot works like this: A voter whose name doesn\u2019t appear on the voter registration list at a precinct polling place on Election Day\u2014but who believes she or he is, in fact, registered\u2014may be offered a provisional ballot. After being marked, it's placed in a special secrecy envelope rather than in the ballot box. After the polls close, the registration status of the voter is determined. If the voter was in fact registered in that precinct on Election Day, the ballot is removed from the secrecy envelope and counted just like any other ballot. If the voter wasn\u2019t registered, the ballot remains in the secrecy envelope and is not counted.\n\nHow provisional ballots are implemented varies significantly across the states, reflecting differences in both state laws and cultural practices. While provisional ballots are intended as a method to ensure that no voter is turned away from the polls when there are questions about registration, there is still controversy over whether provisional ballot use is a positive or negative factor in election administration.\n\nThis explainer was last updated on March 27, 2024.",

        "text": "Biden-Harris Administration Finalizes Rules to Strengthen Protection and Recovery of Threatened and Endangered Species and Their Habitats\nDate: Thursday, March 28, 2024\n\nContact: Interior_Press@ios.doi.gov\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Department of the Interior\u2019s U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Department of Commerce\u2019s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA Fisheries) have finalized three rules that will restore important protections for species and their habitats; strengthen the processes for listing species, designating of critical habitat, and consultation with other federal agencies; and ensure a science-based approach that will improve both agencies\u2019 ability to fulfill their responsibilities under the Endangered Species Act (ESA).\n\nThese rules also help further President Biden\u2019s Day One executive action to ensure an all-of-government approach to bolster resilience to the impacts of climate change.\n\n\u201cAs species face new and daunting challenges, including climate change, degraded and fragmented habitat, invasive species, and wildlife disease, the Endangered Species Act is more important than ever to conserve and recover imperiled species now and for generations to come,\u201d said U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Director Martha Williams. \u201cThese revisions underscore our commitment to using all of the tools available to help halt declines and stabilize populations of the species most at-risk. We will continue to use the best-available science when implementing the ESA \u2014 including when making listing and delisting decisions, designating critical habitat, developing protective regulations for threatened species, and consulting on federal actions.\u201d\n\n\u201cWorking with our partners, NOAA Fisheries is improving the process for managing species under the Endangered Species Act with a focus on mitigation of ongoing threats such as altered ecosystems due to climate change,\u201d said NOAA Fisheries Assistant Administrator Janet Coit. \u201cBy leveraging the best available science, we ensure the law remains robust as we work to conserve and recover endangered and threatened species and their habitats.\u201d\n\nOn June 22, 2023, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and NOAA Fisheries announced three proposed rules revising portions of the ESA implementing regulations. A combined total of approximately 468,000 comments were received during the public comment periods on these three rules.\n\nFollowing that process, the agencies have finalized two separate rules to revise joint ESA regulations regarding interagency cooperation, listing determinations, and critical habitat designations. In addition, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has finalized a third rule to reinstate the \u201cblanket rule\u201d option for protecting threatened species under section 4(d) of the ESA.\n\nThese final rules:\n\nImprove and clarify interagency consultation;\n\nClarify the standards for classification decisions;\n\nAlign the critical habitat designation process with the ESA;\n\nEmphasize that listing decisions and critical habitat designations are based on the best-available science; and\n\nReinstate the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s 4(d) \u201cblanket rule\u201d options that were in place before 2019 for protecting threatened species, which will allow for greater efficiencies when the Service finds the blanket rule protections are appropriate.\n\nThe ESA has been highly effective and credited with preventing the extinction of over 99% of the listed species it has protected over its 50-year history. Thus far, more than 100 species of plants and animals have been delisted due to recovery actions or downlisted from endangered to threatened based on improved conservation status. Hundreds more species are stable or improving thanks to the collaborative actions of federal agencies, Tribes, state and local governments, conservation organizations, industry and private citizens.\n\nThe final rules and additional information are available on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s Endangered Species Act Regulations website and will publish in the coming days in the Federal Register. The rules will be effective 30 days after publication.\n\n###",

        "text": "Montana Supreme Court Strikes Down Voting Laws Intended to Disenfranchise Indigenous Voters\nHELENA, Mont. \u2014 The Montana Supreme Court today ruled in favor of a collection of Native American organizations and tribes, holding that two state laws that hinder Native American participation in the state\u2019s electoral process violate the fundamental right to vote under the Montana Constitution. The case, Western Native Voice et al. v. Jacobsen et al., was consolidated with a challenge brought by the Montana Democratic Party and various youth voting organizations.\n\nOne measure, HB 176, would have ended Election Day registration; the other, HB 530, aimed to prohibit paid third-party ballot assistance. Native American voters living on reservations disproportionately rely upon both Election Day registration and ballot assistance to cast votes in Montana. That is why in 2020, two Montana courts struck down a substantially similar measure to HB 530, finding the restriction on ballot collection disproportionately harmful to Native American voters in rural tribal communities. Today, the Montana Supreme Court found that both HB 176 and HB 530 disproportionately and unconstitutionally burdened the voting rights of Native Americans, in part because it is \u201cmuch more difficult on average for people living on reservations to either get to a polling place on or before election day, or to mail an absentee ballot prior to election day.\u201d\n\nThe decision affirms a September 2022 decision from the Thirteenth Judicial District Court, which permanently enjoined both HB 176 and HB 530 as unconstitutional. Plaintiffs Western Native Voice, Montana Native Vote, the Blackfeet Nation, the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Reservation, the Fort Belknap Indian Community, and the Northern Cheyenne Tribe filed suit, Western Native Voice v. Jacobsen, against HB 176 and HB 530 in May 2021. They are represented by the Native American Rights Fund, American Civil Liberties Union, ACLU of Montana, and Harvard Law School\u2019s Election Law Clinic.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s decision is a resounding win for tribes in Montana who have only ever asked for a fair opportunity to exercise their fundamental right to vote,\u201d said NARF Staff Attorney Jacqueline De Le\u00f3n. \u201cDespite repeated attacks on their voting rights, Tribes and Native voters in Montana stood strong, and today the Montana Supreme Court affirmed that the state\u2019s legislative actions were unconstitutional. Native voices deserve to be heard and this decision helps ensure that happens.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday the Montana Supreme Court resoundingly affirmed what Montanans already know to be true: that our modern constitution guarantees greater protections for individuals in our State,\u201d said Alex Rate, deputy director of the ACLU of Montana. \u201cThis decision affirms one of our most cherished fundamental rights \u2014 the right to vote - which is particularly important to Indigenous voters who already face multiple barriers to the ballot box.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s Montana Supreme Court decision is a great victory for our clients and all Native Americans in Montana, who have asked for nothing more than the ability to exercise their fundamental right to vote,\u201d said Jonathan Topaz, staff attorney at the ACLU\u2019s Voting Rights Project. \u201cOnce again, courts have struck down the Montana Legislature\u2019s attempts to unconstitutionally burden the constitutional rights of Native Americans across the state. We will continue to fight for Native American voters in Montana and across the country to preserve their fundamental, constitutional right to vote.\"\n\n\u201cWe are very pleased with today's landmark ruling by the Montana Supreme Court,\u201d said Western Native Voice Executive Director Ronnie Jo Horse. \u201cIt stands as a testament to justice prevailing in defense of the rights of Montanans, especially those of Native Americans communities . By striking down laws that impede Native American participation in our electoral process, the court reinforces the principle of equitable access to voting services and the protection of the rights for all voters, especially those residing on reservations where voting barriers are much higher.\u201d\n\nThe Montana Supreme Court\u2019s ruling is here: https://wp.api.aclu.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Opinion-Published.pdf",

        "text": "Chicago Tribune\nMajor American newspaper, founded 1847\n\n\"The Trib\" redirects here. For other newspapers with similar names, see Tribune (disambiguation)\n\nThe Chicago Tribune is an American daily newspaper based in Chicago, Illinois. Founded in 1847, and formerly self-styled as the \"World's Greatest Newspaper\",[2][3] a slogan from which its once integrated WGN radio and WGN television received their call letters. As of 2023, it is the most-read daily newspaper in the Chicago metropolitan area and the Great Lakes region and the ninth-largest newspaper by print circulation in the United States.[4]\n\nIn the 1850s, under Joseph Medill, the Chicago Tribune became closely associated with the Illinois politician Abraham Lincoln, and the then new Republican Party's progressive wing. In the 20th century, under Medill's grandson 'Colonel' Robert R. McCormick, its reputation was that of a crusading newspaper with an outlook that promoted American conservatism and opposed the New Deal. Its reporting and commentary reached markets outside Chicago through family and corporate relationships at the New York Daily News and the Washington Times-Herald. Through much of the 20th century into the early 21st, it employed a network of overseas news bureaus and foreign correspondents. In the 1960s, its corporate parent owner, Tribune Company began expanding into new markets buying additional daily papers. For the first time in its over-a-century-and-a-half history, in 2008, its editorial page endorsed a Democrat, Barack Obama, a U.S. Senator from Illinois, for U.S. president.[5]\n\nOriginally published solely as a broadsheet, the Tribune announced on January 13, 2009, that it would continue publishing as a broadsheet for home delivery, but would publish in tabloid format for newsstand, news box, and commuter station sales.[6] The change, however, proved unpopular with readers; in August 2011, the Tribune discontinued the tabloid edition, returning to its established broadsheet format through all distribution channels.[7]\n\nThe Tribune was owned by parent company Tribune Publishing. In May 2021, Tribune Publishing was acquired by Alden Global Capital, which operates its media properties through Digital First Media; since then, the newspaper's coverage has evolved away from national and international news and toward coverage of Illinois and especially Chicago-area news.\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\n19th century [ edit ]\n\nAn 1870 advertisement for Chicago Tribune subscriptions\n\nThe lead editorial in the Chicago Tribune following the Great Chicago Fire\n\nThe Tribune was founded by James Kelly, John E. Wheeler, and Joseph K. C. Forrest, publishing the first edition on June 10, 1847. Numerous changes in ownership and editorship took place over the next eight years. Initially, the Tribune was not politically affiliated, but tended to support either the Whig or Free Soil parties against the Democrats in elections.[8] By late 1853, it was frequently running editorials that criticized foreigners and Roman Catholics.[9] About this time, it also became a strong proponent of temperance.[10] However nativist its editorials may have been, it was not until February 10, 1855, that the Tribune formally affiliated itself with the nativist American or Know Nothing party, whose candidate Levi Boone was elected Mayor of Chicago the following month.[11]\n\nAround 1854, part-owner Capt. J. D. Webster, later General Webster and chief of staff at the Battle of Shiloh, and Charles H. Ray of Galena, Illinois, through Horace Greeley, convinced Joseph Medill of Cleveland's Leader to become managing editor.[12][13][14] Ray became editor-in-chief, Medill became the managing editor, and Alfred Cowles, Sr., brother of Edwin Cowles, initially was the bookkeeper. Each purchased one third of the Tribune.[15][16] Under their leadership, the Tribune distanced itself from the Know Nothings, and became the main Chicago organ of the Republican Party.[17] However, the paper continued to print anti-Catholic and anti-Irish editorials, in the wake of the massive famine immigration from Ireland.[18]\n\nThe Tribune absorbed three other Chicago publications under the new editors: the Free West in 1855, the Democratic Press of William Bross in 1858, and the Chicago Democrat in 1861, whose editor, John Wentworth, left his position when elected as Mayor of Chicago. Between 1858 and 1860, the paper was known as the Chicago Press & Tribune. On October 25, 1860, it became the Chicago Daily Tribune.[19] Before and during the American Civil War, the new editors strongly supported Abraham Lincoln, whom Medill helped secure the presidency in 1860, and pushed an abolitionist agenda.[citation needed] The paper remained a force in Republican politics for years afterwards.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1861, the Tribune published new lyrics by William W. Patton for the song \"John Brown's Body\". These rivaled the lyrics published two months later by Julia Ward Howe. Medill served as mayor of Chicago for one term after the Great Chicago Fire of 1871.[citation needed]\n\n20th century [ edit ]\n\nTribune in 1919\n\nIn the 20th-century, Colonel Robert R. McCormick, who took control in the 1920s, the paper was strongly isolationist and aligned with the Old Right in its coverage of political news and social trends. It used the motto \"The American Paper for Americans\". From the 1930s to the 1950s, it excoriated the Democrats and the New Deal of Franklin D. Roosevelt, was resolutely disdainful of the British and French, and greatly enthusiastic for Chiang Kai-shek and Sen. Joseph McCarthy.\n\nWhen McCormick assumed the position of co-editor with his cousin Joseph Medill Patterson in 1910, the Tribune was the third-best-selling paper among Chicago's eight dailies, with a circulation of only 188,000.[20] The young cousins added features such as advice columns and homegrown comic strips such as Little Orphan Annie and Moon Mullins. They promoted political crusades, and their first success came with the ouster of the Republican political boss of Illinois, Sen. William Lorimer.[20] At the same time, the Tribune competed with the Hearst paper, the Chicago Examiner, in a circulation war. By 1914, the cousins succeeded in forcing out William Keeley, the newspaper's managing editor. By 1918, the Examiner was forced to merge with the Chicago Herald.\n\nIn 1919, Patterson left the Tribune and moved to New York City to launch his own newspaper, the New York Daily News.[20] In a renewed circulation war with Hearst's Herald-Examiner, McCormick and Hearst ran rival lotteries in 1922. The Tribune won the battle, adding 250,000 readers to its ranks. The same year, the Chicago Tribune hosted an international design competition for its new headquarters, the Tribune Tower. The competition worked brilliantly as a publicity stunt, and more than 260 entries were received. The winner was a neo-Gothic design by New York architects John Mead Howells and Raymond Hood.\n\nThe newspaper sponsored a pioneering attempt at Arctic aviation in 1929, an attempted round-trip to Europe across Greenland and Iceland in a Sikorsky amphibious aircraft.[21] But, the aircraft was destroyed by ice on July 15, 1929, near Ungava Bay at the tip of Labrador, Canada. The crew were rescued by the Canadian science ship CSS Acadia.[22]\n\nThe Tribune's reputation for innovation extended to radio; it bought an early station, WDAP, in 1924 and renamed it WGN, the station call letters standing for the paper's self-description as the \"World's Greatest Newspaper\". WGN Television was launched on April 5, 1948. These broadcast stations remained Tribune properties for nine decades and were among the oldest newspaper/broadcasting cross-ownerships in the country. (The Tribune's East Coast sibling, the New York Daily News, later established WPIX television and FM radio.)\n\nThe Tribune's legendary sports editor Arch Ward created the Major League Baseball All-Star Game in 1933 as part of the city's Century of Progress exposition.\n\nFrom 1940 to 1943, the paper supplemented its comic strip offerings with The Chicago Tribune Comic Book, responding to the new success of comic books. At the same time, it launched the more successful and longer-lasting The Spirit Section, which was also an attempt by newspapers to compete with the new medium.[23]\n\nUnder McCormick's stewardship, the Tribune was a champion of modified spelling for simplicity (such as spelling \"although\" as \"altho\").[24][25] McCormick, a vigorous campaigner for the Republican Party, died in 1955, just four days before Democratic boss Richard J. Daley was elected mayor for the first time.\n\nOne of the great scoops in Tribune history came when it obtained the text of the Treaty of Versailles in June 1919. Another was its revelation of United States war plans on the eve of the Pearl Harbor attack. The Tribune's June 7, 1942, front page announcement that the United States had broken Japan's naval code was the revelation by the paper of a closely guarded military secret.[26] The story revealing that Americans broke the enemy naval codes was not cleared by censors, and had U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt so enraged that he considered shutting down the Tribune.[27][28][29][30]\n\n1948 U.S. presidential election [ edit ]\n\nTruman was widely expected to lose the 1948 election, and the Chicago Tribune ran the incorrect headline, \"Dewey Defeats Truman\".\n\nThe paper is well known for a mistake it made during the 1948 presidential election. At that time, much of its composing room staff was on strike. The early returns led editors to believe (along with many in the country) that the Republican candidate Thomas Dewey would win. An early edition of the next day's paper carried the headline \"Dewey Defeats Truman\", turning the paper into a collector's item. Democrat Harry S. Truman won and proudly brandished the newspaper in a famous picture taken at St. Louis Union Station. Beneath the headline was a false article, written by Arthur Sears Henning, which purported to describe West Coast results although written before East Coast election returns were available.\n\nIn 1969, under the leadership of publisher Harold Grumhaus and editor Clayton Kirkpatrick (1915\u20132004), the Tribune began reporting from a wider viewpoint. The paper retained its Republican and conservative perspective in its editorials, but it began to publish perspectives in wider commentary that represented a spectrum of diverse opinions, while its news reporting no longer had the conservative slant it had in the McCormick years.\n\nOn May 1, 1974, in a major feat of journalism, the Tribune published the complete 246,000-word text of the Watergate tapes, in a 44-page supplement that hit the streets 24 hours after the transcripts' release by the Nixon White House. Not only was the Tribune the first newspaper to publish the transcripts, but it beat the U.S. Government Printing Office's published version, and made headlines doing so.[clarification needed]\n\nA week later, after studying the transcripts, the paper's editorial board observed that \"the high dedication to grand principles that Americans have a right to expect from a President is missing from the transcript record.\" The Tribune's editors concluded that \"nobody of sound mind can read [the transcripts] and continue to think that Mr. Nixon has upheld the standards and dignity of the Presidency,\" and called for Nixon's resignation. The Tribune call for Nixon to resign made news, reflecting not only the change in the type of conservatism practiced by the paper, but as a watershed event in terms of Nixon's hopes for survival in office. The White House reportedly perceived the Tribune's editorial as a loss of a long-time supporter and as a blow to Nixon's hopes to weather the scandal.\n\nOn December 7, 1975, Kirkpatrick announced in a column on the editorial page that Rick Soll, a \"young and talented columnist\" for the paper, whose work had \"won a following among many Tribune readers over the last two years\", had resigned from the paper. He had acknowledged that a November 23, 1975, column he wrote contained verbatim passages written by another columnist in 1967 and later published in a collection. Kirkpatrick did not identify the columnist. The passages in question, Kirkpatrick wrote, were from a notebook where Soll regularly entered words, phrases and bits of conversation which he had wished to remember. The paper initially suspended Soll for a month without pay. Kirkpatrick wrote that further evidence was revealed came out that another of Soll's columns contained information which he knew was false. At that point, Tribune editors decided to accept the resignation offered by Soll when the internal investigation began.[31]\n\nAfter leaving, Soll married Pam Zekman, a Chicago newspaper (and future TV) reporter. He worked for the short-lived[32][33] Chicago Times magazine,[34] by Small Newspaper Group Inc. of Kankakee, Illinois,[35] in the late 1980s. Soll was born in 1946, in Chicago, to Marjorie and Jules Soll. Soll graduated from New Trier High School, received a Bachelor of Arts in 1968 from Colgate University, and a master's degree from Medill School of Journalism, Northwestern University in 1970.[36][37]\n\nIn January 1977, Tribune columnist Will Leonard died at age 64.[38] In March 1978, the Tribune announced that it hired columnist Bob Greene from the Chicago Sun-Times.[39]\n\nKirkpatrick stepped down as editor in 1979 and was succeeded by Maxwell McCrohon (1928\u20132004), who served as editor until 1981. He was transitioned to a corporate position. McCrohon held the corporate position until 1983, when he left to become editor-in-chief of the United Press International. James Squires served as the paper's editor from July 1981 until December 1989.\n\nJack Fuller served as the Tribune's editor from 1989 until 1993, when he became the president and chief executive officer of the Chicago Tribune. Howard Tyner served as the Tribune''s editor from 1993 until 2001, when he was promoted to vice president/editorial for Tribune Publishing.\n\nThe Tribune won 11 Pulitzer prizes during the 1980s and 1990s.[40] Editorial cartoonist Dick Locher won the award in 1983, and editorial cartoonist Jeff MacNelly won one in 1985. Then, future editor Jack Fuller won a Pulitzer for editorial writing in 1986. In 1987, reporters Jeff Lyon and Peter Gorner won a Pulitzer for explanatory reporting, and in 1988, Dean Baquet, William Gaines and Ann Marie Lipinski won a Pulitzer for investigative reporting. In 1989, Lois Wille won a Pulitzer for editorial writing and Clarence Page snagged the award for commentary. In 1994, Ron Kotulak won a Pulitzer for explanatory journalism, while R. Bruce Dold won it for editorial writing. In 1998, reporter Paul Salopek won a Pulitzer for explanatory writing, and in 1999, architecture critic Blair Kamin won it for criticism.[40]\n\nIn September 1981, baseball writer Jerome Holtzman was hired by the Tribune after a 38-year career at the Sun-Times.\n\nIn September 1982, the Chicago Tribune opened a new $180 million printing facility, Freedom Center.[41]\n\nIn November 1982, Tribune managing editor William H. \"Bill\" Jones, who had won a Pulitzer Prize in 1971, died at age 43 of cardiac arrest as a result of complications from a long battle with leukemia.[42]\n\nIn May 1983, Tribune columnist Aaron Gold died at age 45 of complications from leukemia.[43] Gold had coauthored the Tribune's \"Inc.\" column with Michael Sneed and prior to that had written the paper's \"Tower Ticker\" column.\n\nThe Tribune scored a coup in 1984 when it hired popular columnist Mike Royko away from the rival Sun-Times.[44]\n\nIn 1986, the Tribune announced that film critic Gene Siskel, the Tribune's best-known writer, was no longer the paper's film critic, and that his position with the paper had shifted from being that of a full-time film critic to that of a freelance contract writer who was to write about the film industry for the Sunday paper and also provide capsule film reviews for the paper's entertainment sections.[45]\n\nThe demotion occurred after Siskel and longtime Chicago film critic colleague Roger Ebert decided to shift the production of their weekly movie review show, then known as At the Movies with Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert and later known as Siskel & Ebert & The Movies from Tribune Entertainment to The Walt Disney Company's Buena Vista Television unit. \"He has done a great job for us,\" editor James Squires said at the time. \"It's a question of how much a person can do physically. We think you need to be a newspaper person first, and Gene Siskel has always tried to do that. But there comes a point when a career is so big that you can't do that.\" Siskel declined to comment on the new arrangement, but Ebert publicly criticized Siskel's Tribune bosses for punishing Siskel for taking their television program to a company other than Tribune Entertainment.[46] Siskel remained in that freelance position until he died in 1999. He was replaced as film critic by Dave Kehr.[47]\n\nIn February 1988, Tribune foreign correspondent Jonathan Broder resigned after a February 22, 1988, Tribune article written by Broder contained a number of sentences and phrases taken, without attribution, from a column written by another writer, Joel Greenberg, that had been published 10 days earlier in The Jerusalem Post.[48][49]\n\nIn August 1988, Chicago Tribune reporter Michael Coakley died at age 41 of complications from AIDS.[50]\n\nIn November 1992, Tribune associate subject editor Searle \"Ed\" Hawley was arrested by Chicago police and charged with seven counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse for allegedly having sex with three juveniles in his home in Evanston, Illinois.[51] Hawley formally resigned from the paper in early 1993, and pleaded guilty in April 1993. He was sentenced to 3 years in prison.[52]\n\nIn October 1993, the Tribune fired its longtime military affairs writer, retired Marine David Evans, saying publicly that the position was being replaced by a national security writer.[53]\n\nIn December 1993, the Tribune's longtime Washington, D.C. bureau chief, Nicholas Horrock, was fired after he chose not to attend a meeting that editor Howard Tyner requested of him in Chicago.[54] Horrock, who shortly thereafter left the paper, was replaced by James Warren, who attracted new attention to the Tribune's D.C. bureau through his continued attacks on celebrity broadcast journalists in Washington.\n\nIn December 1993, the Tribune hired Margaret Holt from the South Florida Sun-Sentinel as its assistant managing editor for sports, making her the first female to head a sports department at any of the nation's 10 largest newspapers.[55] In mid-1995, Holt was replaced as sports editor by Tim Franklin and shifted to a newly created job, customer service editor.[56]\n\nIn 1994, reporter Brenda You was fired by the Tribune after free-lancing for supermarket tabloid newspapers and lending them photographs from the Tribune's photo library.[39] She later worked for the National Enquirer and as a producer for The Jerry Springer Show before committing suicide in November 2005.[57]\n\nIn April 1994, the Tribune's new television critic, Ken Parish Perkins, wrote an article about then-WFLD morning news anchor Bob Sirott in which Perkins quoted Sirott as making a statement that Sirott later denied making. Sirott criticized Perkins on the air, and the Tribune later printed a correction acknowledging that Sirott had never made that statement.[58] Eight months later, Perkins stepped down as TV critic, and he left the paper shortly thereafter.[59]\n\nIn December 1995, the alternative newsweekly Newcity published a first-person article by the pseudonymous Clara Hamon (a name mentioned in the play The Front Page) but quickly identified by Tribune reporters as that of former Tribune reporter Mary Hill that heavily criticized the paper's one-year residency program. The program brought young journalists in and out of the paper for one-year stints, seldom resulting in a full-time job. Hill, who wrote for the paper from 1992 until 1993, acknowledged to the Chicago Reader that she had written the diatribe originally for the Internet, and that the piece eventually was edited for Newcity.[60]\n\nIn 1997, the Tribune celebrated its 150th anniversary in part by tapping longtime reporter Stevenson Swanson to edit the book Chicago Days: 150 Defining Moments in the Life of a Great City.\n\nOn April 29, 1997, popular columnist Mike Royko died of a brain aneurysm. On September 2, 1997, the Tribune promoted longtime City Hall reporter John Kass to take Royko's place as the paper's principal Page Two news columnist.[61]\n\nOn June 1, 1997, the Tribune published what ended up becoming a very popular column by Mary Schmich called \"Advice, like youth, probably just wasted on the young\", otherwise known as \"Wear Sunscreen\" or the \"Sunscreen Speech\". The most popular and well-known form of the essay is the successful music single released in 1999, accredited to Baz Luhrmann.\n\nIn 1998, reporter Jerry Thomas was fired by the Tribune after he wrote a cover article on boxing promoter Don King for Emerge magazine at the same time that he was writing a cover article on King for the Chicago Tribune Sunday magazine. The paper decided to fire Thomas\u2014and suspend his photographer on the Emerge story, Pulitzer Prize-winning Tribune photographer Ovie Carter for a month\u2014because Thomas did not tell the Tribune about his outside work and also because the Emerge story wound up appearing in print first.[62]\n\nOn June 6, 1999, the Tribune published a first-person travel article from freelance writer Gaby Plattner that described a supposed incident in which a pilot for Air Zimbabwe who was flying without a copilot inadvertently locked himself out of his cockpit while the plane was flying on autopilot and as a result needed to use a large ax to chop a hole in the cockpit door.[63] An airline representative wrote a lengthy letter to the paper calling the account \"totally untrue, unprofessional and damaging to our airline\" and explaining that Air Zimbabwe does not keep axes on its aircraft and never flies without a full crew,[64] and the paper was forced to print a correction stating that Plattner \"now says that she passed along a story she had heard as something she had experienced.\"[63]\n\nThe Tribune has been a leader on the Internet, acquiring 10 percent of America Online in the early 1990s, then launching such web sites as Chicagotribune.com (1995), Metromix.com (1996), ChicagoSports.com (1999), ChicagoBreakingNews.com (2008), and ChicagoNow (2009). In 2002, the paper launched a tabloid edition targeted at 18- to 34-year-olds known as RedEye.\n\n21st century [ edit ]\n\nAnn Marie Lipinski was the paper's editor from February 2001 until stepping down on July 17, 2008. Gerould W. Kern was named the paper's editor in July 2008.[65] In early August 2008, managing editor for news Hanke Gratteau resigned, and several weeks later, managing editor for features James Warren resigned as well.[66] Both were replaced by Jane Hirt, who previously had been the editor of the Tribune's RedEye tabloid.[66]\n\nIn June 2000, Times Mirror merged with Tribune Company making The Baltimore Sun and its community papers Baltimore Sun Media Group / Patuxent Publishing a subsidiary of Tribune.[67][68]\n\nIn July 2000, Tribune outdoors columnist John Husar, who had written about his need for a new liver transplant, died at age 63, just over a week after receiving part of a new liver from a live donor.[69]\n\nTribune's Baltimore Community papers include Arbutus Times, Baltimore Messenger, Catonsville Times, Columbia Flier, Howard County Times, The Jeffersonian, Laurel Leader, Lifetimes, North County News, Northeast Booster, Northeast Reporter, Owings Mills Times, and Towson Times.\n\nThe Howard County Times was named 2010 Newspaper of the Year by the Suburban Newspaper Association.[70]\n\nThe Towson Times expands coverage beyond the Towson area and includes Baltimore County government and politics.[71][72]\n\nThe Tribune won five Pulitzer prizes in the first decade of the 21st century.[40] Salopek won his second Pulitzer for the Tribune in 2001 for international reporting, and that same year an explanatory reporting team\u2014lead writers of which were Louise Kiernan, Jon Hilkevitch, Laurie Cohen, Robert Manor, Andrew Martin, John Schmeltzer, Alex Rodriguez and Andrew Zajac\u2014won the honor for a profile of the chaotic U.S. air traffic system.[40][73] In 2003, editorial writer Cornelia Grumman snagged the award for editorial writing.[40] In 2005, Julia Keller won a Pulitzer for feature reporting on a tornado that struck Utica, Illinois.[40] And, in 2008, an investigative reporting team including Patricia Callahan, Maurice Possley, Sam Roe, Ted Gregory, Michael Oneal, Evan Osnos and photojournalist Scott Strazzante won the Pulitzer for its series about faulty government regulation of defective toys, cribs and car seats.[40][74]\n\nIn late 2001, sports columnist Michael Holley announced he was leaving the Tribune after just two months because he was homesick.[75] He ultimately returned to The Boston Globe, where he had been working immediately before the Tribune had hired him.[75]\n\nOn September 15, 2002, Lipinski wrote a terse, page-one note informing readers that the paper's longtime columnist, Bob Greene, resigned effective immediately after acknowledging \"engaging in inappropriate sexual conduct some years ago with a girl in her late teens whom he met in connection with his newspaper column.\" The conduct later was revealed to have occurred in 1988 with a woman who was of the age of consent in Illinois. \"Greene's behavior was a serious violation of Tribune ethics and standards for its journalists,\" Lipinski wrote. \"We deeply regret the conduct, its effect on the young woman and the impact this disclosure has on the trust our readers placed in Greene and this newspaper.\"[76][77]\n\nIn January 2003, Mike Downey, formerly of the Los Angeles Times, was hired as new Tribune sports columnist. He and colleague Rick Morrissey would write the In the Wake of the News Column originated by Ring Lardner.\n\nIn March 2004, the Tribune announced that freelance reporter Uli Schmetzer, who retired from the Tribune in 2002 after 16 years as a foreign correspondent, had fabricated the name and occupation of a person he had quoted in a story. The paper terminated Schmetzer as a contract reporter and began a review of the 300 stories that Schmetzer had written over the prior three years.[78]\n\nIn May 2004, the Tribune revealed that freelance reporter Mark Falanga was unable to verify some facts that he inserted in a lifestyle-related column that ran on April 18, 2004, about an expensive lunch at a Chicago restaurant\u2014namely, that the restaurant charged $15 for a bottle of water and $35 for a pasta entree. \"Upon questioning, the freelance writer indicated the column was based on an amalgam of three restaurants and could not verify the prices,\" the paper noted.[79][80] After the correction, the Tribune stopped using Falanga.\n\nIn October 2004, Tribune editor Ann Marie Lipinski at the last minute spiked a story written for the paper's WomanNews section by freelance reporter Lisa Bertagnoli titled \"You c_nt say that (or can you?),\" about a noted vulgarism.[81] The paper ordered every spare body to go to the Tribune's printing plant to pull already-printed WomanNews sections containing the story from the October 27, 2004, package of preprinted sections in the Tribune.[81]\n\nIn September 2008, the Tribune considered hiring controversial sports columnist Jay Mariotti, shortly after his abrupt resignation from Tribune archrival Chicago Sun-Times.[82] Discussions ultimately ended, however, after the Sun-Times threatened to sue for violating Mariotti's noncompete agreement, which was to run until August 2009.[82] Sports columnist Rick Morrissey defected to the Sun-Times in December 2009.\n\nIn April 2009, 55 Tribune reporters and editors signed their names to an e-mail sent to Kern and managing editor Jane Hirt, questioning why the newspaper's marketing department had solicited subscribers' opinions on stories before they were published, and suggesting that the practice raised ethical questions as well as legal and competitive issues. Reporters declined to speak on the record to the Associated Press about their issues. \"We'll let the e-mail speak for itself,\" reporter John Chase told the AP. In the wake of the controversy, Kern abruptly discontinued the effort, which he described as \"a brief market research project\".[83]\n\nIn the first decade of the 21st century, the Tribune had multiple rounds of reductions of staff through layoffs and buyouts as it has coped with the industrywide declines in advertising revenues:\n\nThe Tribune broke the story on May 29, 2009, that several students had been admitted to the University of Illinois based upon connections or recommendations by the school's Board of Trustees, Chicago politicians, and members of the Rod Blagojevich administration. Initially denying the existence of a so-called \"Category I\" admissions program, university President B. Joseph \"Joe\" White and Chancellor Richard Herman later admitted that there were instances of preferential treatment. Although they claimed the list was short and their role was minor, the Tribune, in particular, revealed emails through a FOIA finding that White had received a recommendation for a relative of convicted fundraiser Tony Rezko to be admitted. The Tribune also later posted emails from Herman pushing for underqualified students to be accepted.[98][99] The Tribune has since filed suit against the university administration under the Freedom of Information Act to acquire the names of students benefited by administrative clout and impropriety.\n\nOn February 8, 2010, the Chicago Tribune shrank its newspaper's width by an inch. They said that the new format was becoming the industry standard and that there would be minimal content changes.\n\nIn July 2011, the Chicago Tribune underwent its first round of layoffs of editorial employees in more than two years, letting go about 20 editors and reporters.[100] Among those let go were DuPage County reporter Art Barnum, Editorial Board member Pat Widder and photographer Dave Pierini.[100][101]\n\nOn March 15, 2012, the Tribune laid off 15 editorial staffers, including security guard Wendell Smothers (Smothers then died on November 12, 2012).[102][103] At the same time, the paper gave buyouts to six editorial staffers, including Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter William Mullen, Barbara Mahany and Nancy Reese.[104]\n\nIn June 2012, the Tribune's Pulitzer Prize-winning cultural critic Julia Keller left the paper to join the faculty of Ohio University and to pursue a career as a novelist.[105]\n\nIn September 2012, Tribune education reporter Joel Hood resigned from the paper to become a real estate broker, City Hall reporter Kristen Mack left the paper to become press secretary for Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle,[106] and the Tribune hired Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer John J. Kim from the Chicago Sun-Times.[107]\n\nIn October 2012, the Tribune's science and medicine reporter, Trine Tsouderos, quit to join a public relations firm.[108]\n\nAlso in October 2012, the Tribune announced plans to create a paywall for its website, offering digital-only subscriptions at $14.99 per month, starting on November 1, 2012. Seven-day print subscribers would continue to have unlimited online access at no additional charge.[109]\n\nIn February 2013, the Tribune agreed to pay a total of $660,000 to settle a class-action lawsuit that had been filed against the paper by 46 current and former reporters of its TribLocal local-news reporting group over unpaid overtime wages.[110] The suit had been filed in federal court on behalf of Carolyn Rusin, who had been a TribLocal staff reporter from July 2010 until October 2011.[110] The paper's TribLocal unit had been formed in 2007 and uses staff reporters, freelance writers and user-generated content to produce hyperlocal Chicago-area community news.[110]\n\nOn June 12, 2013, the Boston Marathon bombing moving tribute was posted again, which showed the words \"We are Chicago\" above the names of Boston sports teams.[111] On the graphic on June 12, the word \"Bruins\" was ripped off and the comment was added, \"Yeah, not right now we're not\", in a reference to the 2013 Stanley Cup Finals, which play the Chicago Blackhawks against the Boston Bruins.[111] Gerould Kern tweeted later that the Tribune \"still supports [Boston] after all you've been through. We regret any offense. Now let's play hockey.\"[111]\n\nOn November 20, 2013, the Tribune laid off another 12 or so editorial staffers.[112]\n\nOn April 6, 2014, the Tribune increased the newsstand price of its Sunday/Thanksgiving Day paper by 50 percent to $2.99 for a single copy. The newsrack price increased $0.75, or 42.9%, to $2.50.[113] By January 2017 the price increased again, up $1 or 40% at newsracks, to $3.50. At newsstands it went up also $1, or 33.3%, to $3.99.\n\nOn January 28, 2015, metropolitan editor Peter Kendall was named managing editor, replacing Jane Hirt, who had resigned several months earlier. Colin McMahon was named associate editor.[114]\n\nOn February 18, 2016, the Tribune announced the retirement of editor Gerould Kern and the immediate promotion of the paper's editorial page editor, R. Bruce Dold, to be the Tribune's editor.[48]\n\nOn June 9, 2018, the Tribune ended their 93-year stint at Tribune Tower and moved to One Prudential Plaza. The tower was later converted to condos.[115]\n\n2020s [ edit ]\n\nOn February 27, 2020, the Tribune announced that publisher and editor Bruce Dold will leave the Tribune on April 30, 2020, and would step down immediately as editor in chief. His replacement as editor was Colin McMahon. Also, the paper announced that one of the two managing editors of the paper, Peter Kendall, would leave the Tribune on February 28, 2020.[116]\n\nIn January 2021, the Chicago Tribune moved out of One Prudential Plaza, and relocated their offices and newsroom to Freedom Center.[117]\n\nIn May 2021, the paper was purchased by Alden Global Capital.[118] Alden immediately launched a round of employee buyouts, reducing the newsroom staff by 25 percent, and the cuts continued. A former reporter said the paper is being \"snuffed out, quarter after quarter after quarter\".[119] A report in The Atlantic said that Alden's business model is simple: \"Gut the staff, sell the real estate, jack up subscription prices, and wring as much cash as possible out of the enterprise until eventually enough readers cancel their subscriptions that the paper folds, or is reduced to a desiccated husk of its former self.\"[119]\n\nMitch Pugh was named the Tribune's executive editor on August 20, 2021, after eight years in the same role at The Post and Courier in Charleston, South Carolina.[120]\n\nEditorial [ edit ]\n\nTribune Tower, the newspaper's headquarters, opened in Chicago in 1925.\n\nChicago Tribune building\n\nPolicy [ edit ]\n\nIn a 2007 statement of principles published in the Tribune's print and online editions, the paper's editorial board described the newspaper's philosophy, from which is excerpted the following:\n\nThe Chicago Tribune believes in the traditional principles of limited government; maximum individual responsibility; minimum restriction of personal liberty, opportunity and enterprise. It believes in free markets, free will and freedom of expression. These principles, while traditionally conservative, are guidelines and not reflexive dogmas. The Tribune brings a Midwestern sensibility to public debate. It is suspicious of untested ideas. The Tribune places great emphasis on the integrity of government and the private institutions that play a significant role in society. The newspaper does this in the belief that the people cannot consent to be governed unless they have knowledge of, and faith in, the leaders and operations of government. The Tribune embraces the diversity of people and perspectives in its community. It is dedicated to the future of the Chicago region.\n\nThe Tribune has remained economically conservative, being widely skeptical of increasing the minimum wage and entitlement spending. It criticized the Bush administration's record on civil liberties, the environment, and many aspects of its foreign policy, it continued to support his presidency while taking Democrats, such as Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich and Cook County Board President Todd Stroger, to task and calling for their removal from office.\n\nAs of 2018 , the Chicago Tribune and Los Angeles Times withdrew their website from European Union nations to avoid the purview of the General Data Protection Regulation.[121]\n\nElection endorsements [ edit ]\n\nIn 2004, the Tribune endorsed President George W. Bush for reelection, a decision consistent with its longstanding support for the Republican Party. In 2008, it endorsed Democratic candidate and Illinois junior U.S. Senator Barack Obama\u2014the first time that it had ever endorsed a Democrat for president.[122] The Tribune endorsed Obama once again for reelection in 2012,[123] and in 2020 would endorse another Democrat, Joe Biden, who had served as vice president under Obama.[124]\n\nThe Tribune has occasionally backed candidates of other parties for president. In 1872, it supported Horace Greeley, a former Republican Party newspaper editor,[125] and in 1912 the paper endorsed Theodore Roosevelt, who ran on the Progressive Party slate against Republican President William Howard Taft. In 2016, the Tribune endorsed the Libertarian Party candidate, former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson, for president, over Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton.[126]\n\nEven when it uniformly backed Republicans for president, the Tribune endorsed some Democrats for lesser offices, including endorsements of Bill Foster, Barack Obama for the Senate and Democrat Melissa Bean, who defeated Philip Crane, the House of Representatives' longest-serving Republican. Although the Tribune endorsed George Ryan in the 1998 Illinois gubernatorial race, the paper subsequently investigated and reported on the scandals surrounding Ryan during his preceding years as Secretary of State. Ryan declined to run for re-election in 2002 and was subsequently indicted, convicted and imprisoned as a result of the scandal.\n\nTribune Company [ edit ]\n\nThe Chicago Tribune was the founding business unit of Tribune Company (since renamed Tribune Media), which included many newspapers and television stations around the country. In Chicago, Tribune Media owned the WGN radio station (720 AM) and WGN-TV (Channel 9). Tribune Company also owned the Los Angeles Times\u2014which displaced the Tribune as the company's largest property\u2014and the Chicago Cubs baseball team. The Cubs were sold in 2009;the newspapers spun off in 2014 as Tribune Publishing.\n\nTribune Company owned the New York Daily News from its 1919 founding until its 1991 sale to British newspaper magnate Robert Maxwell. The founder of the NewsCapt. Joseph Medill Patterson, was a grandson of Joseph Medill and a cousin of Tribune editor Robert McCormick. Both Patterson and McCormick were enthusiasts of simplified spelling, another hallmark of their papers for many years. In 2008, the Tribune Company sold the Long Island newspaper Newsday\u2014founded in 1940 by Patterson's daughter (and Medill's great-granddaughter), Alicia Patterson\u2014to Long Island cable TV company Cablevision.\n\nFrom 1925 to 2018, the Chicago Tribune was housed in the Tribune Tower on North Michigan Avenue on the Magnificent Mile. The building is neo-Gothic in style, and the design was the winner of an international competition hosted by the Tribune. The Chicago Tribune moved in June 2018 to the Prudential Plaza office complex overlooking Millennium Park after Tribune Media sold Tribune Tower to developers.\n\nPulitzer Prizes [ edit ]\n\nColonel McCormick prevented the Tribune for years from participating in the Pulitzer Prize competition. But it has won 28[127] of the awards over the years, including many for editorial writing.[40][128][129]\n\nThe Tribune won its first post-McCormick Pulitzer in 1961, when Carey Orr won the award for editorial cartooning. Reporter George Bliss won a Pulitzer the following year for reporting, and reporter Bill Jones another in 1971 for reporting.[40] A reporting team won the award in 1973, followed by reporter William Mullen and photographer Ovie Carter, who won a Pulitzer for international reporting in 1975. A local reporting team won the award in 1976, and architecture critic Paul Gapp won a Pulitzer in 1979.[40] In 2022, Cecilia Reyes, Chicago Tribune, and Madison Hopkins, Better Government Association, won a Pulitzer Prize in local reporting for a piercing examination of the city's long history of failed building- and fire-safety code enforcement, which let scofflaw landlords commit serious violations that resulted in dozens of unnecessary deaths.[130]\n\nCurrent [ edit ]\n\nPast [ edit ]\n\n2008 redesign [ edit ]\n\nThe September 2008 redesign (discussed on the Tribune's web site[132]) was controversial and is largely regarded as an effort in cost-cutting.[133] Since then the newspaper has returned to a more toned down style. The style is more a mix of the old style and a new modern style.\n\nZell ownership and bankruptcy [ edit ]\n\nIn December 2007, the Tribune Company was bought out by Chicago real estate magnate Sam Zell in an $8.2 billion deal. Zell was the company's new chairman.[134] A year after going private, following a $124 million third-quarter loss, the Tribune Company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on December 8, 2008. The company made its filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, citing a debt of $13 billion and assets of $7.6 billion.[135]\n\nSam Zell originally planned to turn the company into a private company through the creation of an ESOP (employee stock ownership plan) within the company, but due to poor management that existed prior to his ownership, this did not work out as well as he intended.[136]\n\nAs part of its bankruptcy plan, owner Sam Zell intended to sell the Cubs to reduce debt. This sale has become linked to the corruption charges leading to the December 9, 2008, arrest of former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich. Specifically, the ex-governor was accused of exploiting the paper's financial trouble in an effort to have several editors fired.[137]\n\nIn the bankruptcy, unsecured bondholders of Tribune Co. essentially claimed that ordinary Tribune shareholders participated in a \"fraudulent transfer\" of wealth.[138]\n\nThe law firm Brown Rudnick, representing the Aurelius group of junior creditors, filed fraudulent transfer claims and fraud claims against 33,000 to 35,000 stockholders who bought Tribune stock.[139] Prolonged due to these claims against former officers, directors, and every former stockholder of the Chicago Tribune Company,[139][140] the Tribune's bankruptcy-related legal and professional fees of $500 million were more than twice the usual amount for that size of company.[141]\n\nThe Tribune Co. emerged from bankruptcy in January 2013, partially owned by private equity firms which had speculated on its distressed debt. The reorganized company's plan included selling off many of its assets.[141]\n\nTribune Publishing divestment [ edit ]\n\nTribune Publishing, owning the Chicago Tribune, Los Angeles Times, and eight other newspapers, was spun off as a separate publicly traded company in August 2014. The parent Tribune Company was renamed Tribune Media.[142] Tribune Publishing started life with a $350 million loan, $275 million of which was paid as a dividend to Tribune Media. The publishing company was also due to lease its office space from Tribune Media for $30 million per year through 2017.[142][143]\n\nSpinning off Tribune Publishing avoided the capital gains taxes that would accrue from selling those assets. The shares in Tribune Publishing were given tax-free to stakeholders in Tribune Media, the largest shareholder was Oaktree Capital Management with 18.5%.[143] Tribune Media, retaining the non-newspaper broadcasting, entertainment, real estate, and other investments, also sold off some of the non-newspaper properties.[142]\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]",

        "text": "Mexican Voters in the United States: Voting Power and Process for Those Voting Abroad\nOverview\n\nThe 2024 Mexican electoral process will be recognized as the largest in the history of the country, according to the National Electoral Institute (INE). On Sunday, June 2nd, 2024, the people of Mexico will elect the next President of the Republic, 128 Senators of the Republic, and all 500 members of the Chamber of Deputies. On the state and local level, votes will be cast for more than 19,000 races. Nine gubernatorial races will occur in the states of Chiapas, Guanajuato, Jalisco, Morelos, Puebla, Tabasco, Veracruz, Yucat\u00e1n, and Mexico City. According to INE advisor Carla Humphrey, it is estimated that over 97 million Mexican voters will participate in the 2024 electoral process.\n\nMexican Population in the United States\n\nThe number of registered Mexican voters abroad exceeds 1.3 million. The number of these citizens with a confirmed voter ID has surpassed half a million people. Approximately 97% of Mexicans living abroad with a valid voting credential live in the United States. Los Angeles, Dallas, Chicago, and Houston are the cities with the highest number of potential votes. To gauge the influence that Mexican voters abroad will have, it's worth mentioning that Colima, the least populous state in the country, has a population of 731,391 inhabitants. Thus, the more than half a million citizens abroad have a political weight comparable to the voter power of an entire Mexican state.\n\nPast Trends and Participation\n\nThe National Electoral Institute first granted Mexicans the opportunity to cast their vote from abroad in the 2006 Mexican presidential election. That election cycle saw 32,621 Mexican nationals exercise their right to vote from abroad. The PAN candidate in that race, Felipe Calderon, received 58.29% of these votes, while then PRD candidate and current Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, received 34.0%. In the 2012 presidential election, participation from voters abroad increased to 40,714 Mexican citizens, resulting in PAN once again receiving the majority of expatriate votes at 42.17%. On the other hand, then-candidate Lopez Obrador received 39.0% of votes from abroad. In the most recent presidential election in 2018, a total of 98,470 individuals cast their votes from abroad. In that race, President Lopez Obrador received 64.86% of the votes, with PAN candidate Ricardo Anaya coming in second with 26.75% of the votes.\n\nRegistering to Vote\n\nMexican voters abroad can process their voter identification card (credencial de elector) free of charge at the nearest Mexican embassy or consulate. Once they have valid voter identification, Mexican nationals can register on the INE website to participate in the upcoming 2024 Mexican elections. Voters can participate in one of three modalities: vote online, via physical mail, or in person at approved consulates. Those interested in participating in the elections must register by February 20, 2024.\n\nState Election Participation\n\nMexican voters abroad can participate in state-level elections in the following nine states: Chiapas, Mexico City, the State of Mexico, Guanajuato, Jalisco, Morelos, Oaxaca, Puebla, and Yucat\u00e1n. Of these states, the following five only allow Mexican votes abroad to participate in their gubernatorial elections: Chiapas, Guanajuato, Morelos, Puebla, and Yucat\u00e1n. Mexico City will allow voters abroad to participate in electing a Head of Government and a Migrant Deputy. Jalisco and the State of Mexico will allow participation to elect proportional representation deputyship, with Jalisco also allowing participation to elect the governorship. Finally, the state of Oaxaca will allow participation to elect a Migrant Deputy. Participation by Mexican voters abroad is as important at the local level as it is in the presidential race.\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nThe 2024 Mexican elections, set to be the largest in the nation's history, symbolize a pivotal moment in Mexican democracy. With an unprecedented number of races and significant participation from Mexican expatriates, predominantly located in the United States, these elections reflect the evolving dynamics of Mexican politics. The expansion of voting rights to citizens abroad, mirroring the political weight of an entire state, and the diverse options for casting votes, underscore a growing recognition of the influence of the global Mexican community. This election cycle is set to be a landmark moment, shaping the future of Mexico, and highlighting the critical role of its global citizenry.",

Other stars such as Queen Latifah and Cynthia Erivo also took the stage.\n\nBut the longest standing ovation was saved for the moment when the three presidents - Mr Biden, Mr Obama and Mr Clinton - came out.\n\nChants of \"four more years\" echoed throughout the auditorium for Mr Biden.\n\n\"Three presidents... and none of them are here [in New York] to go to court,\" joked comedian Stephen Colbert, alluding to Mr Trump's legal troubles.\n\nReuters The discussion between the three presidents was moderated by comedian Stephen Colbert.\n\nThe late-night comedy host then moderated a conversation between the three presidents.\n\nMr Biden began with an oft-repeated slogan, saying democracy was at stake in this election. He said Mr Trump had a \"perverse view of the world\", noting his opponent's vocal support of those who participated in the 6 January Capitol Riot and his buoying of authoritarian leaders abroad.\n\n\"But I'm really hopeful,\" the president added. \"If we get by this election, we can set the course for the next four, five, six decades.\"\n\nMr Obama, for his part, touted Biden's legislative victories. He said the president had done everything from reducing the cost of medicine to creating jobs - particularly for African Americans.\n\nHe added that Mr Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, and his supporters seemed \"increasingly unconcerned with the essence of America\", which he said was centred on the idea of \"bridging our differences and moving forward\".\n\nMr Clinton, meanwhile, accused Mr Trump of \"stealing a few good years\" from the back of Mr Obama's administration and somehow claiming \"overnight\" successes.\n\nThe four men ended their time on stage by putting on aviator sunglasses in an impression of Mr Biden, which earned a standing ovation.\n\nFirst Lady Jill Biden was due to host a private after-party for 500 guests. The president's son, Hunter Biden, and his family were to attend.\n\nThe tickets were priced between $225 and half-a-million dollars. For $100,000, guests could get a picture with Mr Biden, Mr Obama and Mr Clinton, with star photographer Annie Leibovitz taking the snaps.\n\nWhile the three presidents were on the same page during their time on stage, the event did not pass without incident.\n\nProtesters who condemn Israel for its invasion of the Gaza Strip gathered outside Radio City Music Hall to call for a ceasefire. Some were able to interrupt the event inside the theatre as well.\n\nMr Biden quickly took up the issue over the shouts of the protesters and to the applause of the crowd.\n\n\"There has to be a two-state solution, a progression,\" he said. \"But I'm confident that can be done with Israel's integrity... preserved.\"\n\nReuters Pro-Palestinian protesters were outside the event, and some were able to interrupt the fundraiser inside as well.\n\nThe Israel-Gaza war is one of the issues that has been dragging down Mr Biden's approval rating. Voters are also unhappy about the economy, inflation and immigration.\n\nFacing lagging approval ratings, the 81-year-old has worked to capitalise on momentum following his well-received State of the Union Address earlier this month.\n\nThe Biden campaign recently declared it had $155m cash on hand, which it said was the biggest war chest any Democratic candidate had ever possessed at this point in an election cycle.\n\nMr Trump and his political action committees reported having $74m.\n\nMore on the US election\n\nThe president's fundraising lead over Mr Trump - who is seeking a return to the White House four years after his presidency ended - has been boosted by the advantage of incumbency, experts say.\n\n\"Biden raising a lot of money is probably a function of him not having any real primary challengers,\" Joseph Campbell, a communications professor at American University, told the BBC. \"There's no competition for Democratic donor money.\"\n\nMr Trump's campaign and his joint fundraising committee - which have helped pay the former president's legal bills - brought in $20m in the whole of February, less than what the Biden campaign expects to receive just from Thursday's event.\n\nWhile Mr Biden has been criss-crossing the country in recent weeks, Mr Trump has kept a lower political profile as he juggles court appearances.\n\nBut he also appeared in the New York area on Thursday, attending the wake of a police officer, Jonathan Diller, who was shot and killed in the line of duty.\n\nHis campaign contrasted his attendance at the wake with Mr Biden's decision to attend \"a glitzy fundraiser in the city with their elitist, out-of-touch celebrity benefactors\" alongside Mr Obama and Mr Clinton.\n\nPresident Biden was joined on the Air Force One flight to New York by Mr Obama, who remains close to his former vice-president.\n\nWatch: Biden and Obama exit Air Force One in New York City to attend campaign fundraiser\n\nNew York ground to a halt for their arrival as the two men's huge motorcade cut across Manhattan in the pouring rain as hundreds of onlookers jostled to take pictures ahead of the fundraiser.\n\nMr Trump, 77, blasted the Democratic event in a fundraising campaign email on Thursday morning.\n\n\"Hundreds of deranged Hollywood liberals will be in attendance, and they will open their wallets to fund the destruction of this country!\" the message said.\n\nMr Biden's campaign has spent tens of millions on TV and digital advertising targeting black and Latino voters, as the president seeks to hold together the coalition that put him in the White House in the 2020 election.\n\nSome opinion polls have suggested that loyalty among these key voting blocs could be softening, though recent surveys show the president's approval could be beginning to rebound.\n\nThe 2024 presidential election cycle is predicted to be the most expensive in history, with an estimated $2.7bn spent on presidential campaign ads alone.\n\nIf you're in the UK, sign up here.",

In remarks, President Tsai thanked the US for including provisions to help bolster Taiwan's self-defense in the National Defense Authorization Act and for the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, which includes a budget for military assistance for Taiwan and prioritizes delivery of defense articles. The president said that going forward, Taiwan will continue to work with the US to expand cooperation within the global democratic community and thereby contribute even more to security, stability, and prosperity throughout the world.\n\nA translation of President Tsai's remarks follows:\n\nLet me begin by welcoming Chairman Bergman on another visit to Taiwan. This is the first time Chairman Bergman, Congressman Donald Norcross, and Congressman Jimmy Panetta are visiting Taiwan as US Congress members. Thank you all for demonstrating bipartisan US support for Taiwan through concrete action. Our guests today are key members of the House Armed Services Committee. They have long paid close attention to cross-strait issues and actively promoted cooperation and exchanges between Taiwan and the US in Congress so as to jointly safeguard regional peace and stability.\n\nIn recent years, Taiwan has continued to work toward self-sufficiency in national defense. Through programs to develop and produce indigenous aircraft and naval vessels, we are showing the world our commitment to self-defense and to safeguarding freedom and democracy. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the US government and Congress for including provisions to help bolster Taiwan's self-defense in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024 signed at the end of last year. Also, the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024 signed just this month includes a budget for military assistance for Taiwan and prioritizes delivery of defense articles. This support will help further strengthen the Taiwan-US partnership.\n\nIn addition to collaborating on security, Taiwan and the US have increased our economic and trade exchanges in recent years. I hope that our guests can continue to make the case to help resolve the Taiwan-US double taxation issue at the earliest possible juncture, which will facilitate even closer bilateral investment and industrial cooperation.\n\nIn closing, I welcome you all once again and hope that this trip helps deepen your understanding of Taiwan. Going forward, Taiwan will continue to work with the US to expand cooperation within the global democratic community and thereby contribute even more to security, stability, and prosperity throughout the world.\n\nChairman Bergman then delivered remarks, first thanking President Tsai for the hospitality. He said that as a delegation, their efforts here are to learn and to build a relationship, but also to seek to understand what next mutual steps are desired and possible.\n\nChairman Bergman stated that Taiwan is a key US partner in the Indo-Pacific, both through strong security cooperation and economic ties. Their delegation is here, he said, to show Congress's continued support for our partnership. He added that they will continue to assure their colleagues that this strategic relationship is key for the future security of the region, and said that includes a strong Taiwan maritime strategy and how we can work together on shared goals to counter China on their increasingly aggressive actions in the region.\n\nChairman Bergman mentioned that part of their visit here will be to spend time with US personnel to better understand how close the partnership is and what they can do to further the depth and understanding of the relationship as it evolves.\n\nThe delegation was accompanied to the Presidential Office by American Institute in Taiwan Taipei Office Director Sandra Oudkirk.",

        "text": "The Evolution of US-Polish Relations Beyond 2024\nAt a recent public conversation, Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski was asked about the future of the Polish-US relations in light of a possible Trump presidency. He responded with a smile, saying \u201cPoland will have strong relations with the United States whoever is in power in the White House.\u201d\n\nPoland has maintained close relations with the United States since it regained its independence in 1989. In fact, Poland has just celebrated 25 years of membership in NATO, a period that solidified Poland\u2019s return to the West and cemented strategic relations with the United States. Even when transatlantic relations were deeply strained, as during the Iraq war or Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, Polish-American ties remained a priority for Warsaw. Poland also stood out among European nations for maintaining robust ties with the United States during the Trump administration, primarily through the Law and Justice (PiS) party's prioritization of bilateral relations with Trump, often at the expense of relations with other European allies.\n\nHowever, perspectives in Warsaw are poised to shift because, with aid blocked in the House of Representatives, the United States appears to be unable to continue military support for Ukraine. Recently, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk even appealed directly to Speaker Mike Johnson in a tweet: \u201cLook at Odessa, Speaker Johnson! How many more arguments do you need to take a decision?\u201d Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski pointed out that when the commander-in-chief is unable to exercise his power and meet commitments to a partner because of opposition in Congress, the credibility of the United States suffers among its allies. Given Trump\u2019s control over the Republican Party, it is clear to Warsaw that US policy regarding European security is constrained even before the American public chooses its next president. The worries would only grow should Donald Trump secure reelection. These concerns are shared across the political spectrum in Poland.\n\nScenario 1: Trump 2.0\n\nConcerns in Warsaw stem mainly from two key pillars of Trump's announced policies. First, his reluctance to support Ukraine against renewed Russian aggression raises apprehension, given that Poland and neighboring states perceive this as an existential threat. The fear is that failure to support Ukraine could embolden Russia to pose a direct threat to NATO countries, including Poland. Second, Trump's critical stance on NATO raises alarms. Some in Warsaw think that Poland, having committed 4% of its GDP to defense, would be exempt from Trump's criticisms, or even that Trump would finally spur Western Europeans to spend more. However, this line of argument is outweighed by the concern for NATO\u2019s cohesion and the need to avoid potential fissures that Russia could then exploit.\n\nThe potential ramifications of a Trump presidency extend beyond the question of military aid to Ukraine. Trump's record of unpredictable behavior casts doubt on the United States\u2019 reliability as a NATO leader, prompting concerns about its credibility and its ability to confront adversaries. The recent obstructionism in the US House of Representatives on aid to Ukraine further underscores these concerns, eliciting sharp responses such as Prime Minister Donald Tusk's condemnation of Republican senators in a tweet not long before his visit to Washington on March 12: \u201cDear Republican Senators of America. Ronald Reagan, who helped millions of us to win back our freedom and independence, must be turning in his grave today. Shame on you.\u201d\n\nScenario 2: Biden 2.0\n\nMuch less discussed is the scenario of a second term for President Biden. On the surface, the general assumption is that the transatlantic alliance, and Polish-American relations, will largely continue on their current path. The recent election in Poland of a pro-democratic, pro-European coalition would make US-Polish relations even smoother than before, as there would be no tensions around values such as the rule of law, human rights, or relations with other important US allies in Europe such as Germany. But that picture obscures challenges that are likely to emerge in the transatlantic alliance even if Joe Biden wins this November.\n\nFirst, the United States is likely to have divided government under the Biden 2.0 scenario, with the Senate at least coming under Republican control. The experience of the last few months shows how effective a Republican-controlled chamber can be in frustrating the Biden administration\u2019s priorities on Ukraine, European security, and foreign policy more broadly.\n\nSecond, it is clear that the Indo-Pacific\u2014especially the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC)\u2014has become the predominant focus of US grand strategy. As the PRC builds up its capabilities, increasingly challenging the United States militarily\u2014even in the nuclear domain\u2014the Biden 2.0 administration would continue to move its strategic focus there, and away from Europe. US officials sometimes like to say that the United States \u201ccan walk and chew gum at the same time\u201d. But as global confrontations proliferate, often in an unexpected way\u2014as with the war in Gaza\u2014even the most pro-atlanticist administration will be unable to focus mainly on Europe. These two dynamics\u2014America\u2019s divided government and the strategic focus on Asia\u2014mean that at best, the shift in America\u2019s strategic focus will continue to drift toward the Indo-Pacific. At worst, a divided US government would mean a paralyzed US government. Both trends leave Poland and other European allies more exposed geopolitically.\n\nThe European Answer\n\nFor the reasons outlined above, Poland is increasingly looking to Europe to build up defense capabilities and a strategic culture that can take greater responsibility for European security in the years to come. The idea is not to replace the United States as a European power, or NATO as a primary organization for European security, but to create what Foreign Minister Sikorski has described as \u201cEuropean Harmony\u201d. In this situation, NATO, the EU, and member states would work more closely together on guarding European security, but without excluding the United States. In a conversation with GMF, former President of Poland Bronis\u0142aw Komorowski described this thinking best: \"It is not in Poland's interest to choose between the US and the European Union. It is in our interest that we never have to answer such a question.\"\n\nThe format that should spur this greater European strategic cooperation, according to new thinking in Warsaw, is the Weimar Triangle. Poland is finally able to step up here, thanks to the new government\u2019s pro-European credentials, and also because of the leadership vacuum resulting from the troubled German-French relationship. The logic is that in the short term, Weimar and European initiatives would fill the gap in support for Ukraine that has been created by Congressional inaction. Over the medium and long term, the ambition would be for Weimar and the EU as a whole to step up responsibility for European security and defense. As former President Komorowski remarked, \u201cPoland has an opportunity to become a key part of the engine of the European Union\u2014and this at a time when the transatlantic community may be going through a difficult period.\u201d How much time Europe would have to build up its capabilities and strategic culture depends on whether Biden or Trump wins in November. But even the most pro-European voices in Warsaw do not claim that Europe will be able to do this alone. The role that the United States plays in Europe when it comes to leadership, conventional capabilities, and the all-important nuclear umbrella is just too great to be replaced quickly\u2014no matter who occupies the White House next year.",

We will continue to use the best-available science when implementing the ESA \u2014 including when making listing and delisting decisions, designating critical habitat, developing protective regulations for threatened species, and consulting on federal actions.\u201d\n\n\u201cWorking with our partners, NOAA Fisheries is improving the process for managing species under the Endangered Species Act with a focus on mitigation of ongoing threats such as altered ecosystems due to climate change,\u201d said NOAA Fisheries Assistant Administrator Janet Coit. \u201cBy leveraging the best available science, we ensure the law remains robust as we work to conserve and recover endangered and threatened species and their habitats.\u201d\n\nOn June 22, 2023, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and NOAA Fisheries announced three proposed rules revising portions of the ESA implementing regulations. A combined total of approximately 468,000 comments were received during the public comment periods on these three rules.\n\nFollowing that process, the agencies have finalized two separate rules to revise joint ESA regulations regarding interagency cooperation, listing determinations, and critical habitat designations. In addition, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has finalized a third rule to reinstate the \u201cblanket rule\u201d option for protecting threatened species under section 4(d) of the ESA.\n\nThese final rules:\n\nImprove and clarify interagency consultation;\n\nClarify the standards for classification decisions;\n\nAlign the critical habitat designation process with the ESA;\n\nEmphasize that listing decisions and critical habitat designations are based on the best-available science; and\n\nReinstate the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s 4(d) \u201cblanket rule\u201d options that were in place before 2019 for protecting threatened species, which will allow for greater efficiencies when the Service finds the blanket rule protections are appropriate.\n\nThe ESA has been highly effective and credited with preventing the extinction of over 99% of the listed species it has protected over its 50-year history. Thus far, more than 100 species of plants and animals have been delisted due to recovery actions or downlisted from endangered to threatened based on improved conservation status. Hundreds more species are stable or improving thanks to the collaborative actions of federal agencies, Tribes, state and local governments, conservation organizations, industry and private citizens.\n\nThe final rules and additional information are available on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s Endangered Species Act Regulations website and will publish in the coming days in the Federal Register. The rules will be effective 30 days after publication.\n\n###",

        "text": "Mexican Voters in the United States: Voting Power and Process for Those Voting Abroad\nOverview\n\nThe 2024 Mexican electoral process will be recognized as the largest in the history of the country, according to the National Electoral Institute (INE). On Sunday, June 2nd, 2024, the people of Mexico will elect the next President of the Republic, 128 Senators of the Republic, and all 500 members of the Chamber of Deputies. On the state and local level, votes will be cast for more than 19,000 races. Nine gubernatorial races will occur in the states of Chiapas, Guanajuato, Jalisco, Morelos, Puebla, Tabasco, Veracruz, Yucat\u00e1n, and Mexico City. According to INE advisor Carla Humphrey, it is estimated that over 97 million Mexican voters will participate in the 2024 electoral process.\n\nMexican Population in the United States\n\nThe number of registered Mexican voters abroad exceeds 1.3 million. The number of these citizens with a confirmed voter ID has surpassed half a million people. Approximately 97% of Mexicans living abroad with a valid voting credential live in the United States. Los Angeles, Dallas, Chicago, and Houston are the cities with the highest number of potential votes. To gauge the influence that Mexican voters abroad will have, it's worth mentioning that Colima, the least populous state in the country, has a population of 731,391 inhabitants. Thus, the more than half a million citizens abroad have a political weight comparable to the voter power of an entire Mexican state.\n\nPast Trends and Participation\n\nThe National Electoral Institute first granted Mexicans the opportunity to cast their vote from abroad in the 2006 Mexican presidential election. That election cycle saw 32,621 Mexican nationals exercise their right to vote from abroad. The PAN candidate in that race, Felipe Calderon, received 58.29% of these votes, while then PRD candidate and current Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, received 34.0%. In the 2012 presidential election, participation from voters abroad increased to 40,714 Mexican citizens, resulting in PAN once again receiving the majority of expatriate votes at 42.17%. On the other hand, then-candidate Lopez Obrador received 39.0% of votes from abroad. In the most recent presidential election in 2018, a total of 98,470 individuals cast their votes from abroad. In that race, President Lopez Obrador received 64.86% of the votes, with PAN candidate Ricardo Anaya coming in second with 26.75% of the votes.\n\nRegistering to Vote\n\nMexican voters abroad can process their voter identification card (credencial de elector) free of charge at the nearest Mexican embassy or consulate. Once they have valid voter identification, Mexican nationals can register on the INE website to participate in the upcoming 2024 Mexican elections. Voters can participate in one of three modalities: vote online, via physical mail, or in person at approved consulates. Those interested in participating in the elections must register by February 20, 2024.\n\nState Election Participation\n\nMexican voters abroad can participate in state-level elections in the following nine states: Chiapas, Mexico City, the State of Mexico, Guanajuato, Jalisco, Morelos, Oaxaca, Puebla, and Yucat\u00e1n. Of these states, the following five only allow Mexican votes abroad to participate in their gubernatorial elections: Chiapas, Guanajuato, Morelos, Puebla, and Yucat\u00e1n. Mexico City will allow voters abroad to participate in electing a Head of Government and a Migrant Deputy. Jalisco and the State of Mexico will allow participation to elect proportional representation deputyship, with Jalisco also allowing participation to elect the governorship. Finally, the state of Oaxaca will allow participation to elect a Migrant Deputy. Participation by Mexican voters abroad is as important at the local level as it is in the presidential race.\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nThe 2024 Mexican elections, set to be the largest in the nation's history, symbolize a pivotal moment in Mexican democracy. With an unprecedented number of races and significant participation from Mexican expatriates, predominantly located in the United States, these elections reflect the evolving dynamics of Mexican politics. The expansion of voting rights to citizens abroad, mirroring the political weight of an entire state, and the diverse options for casting votes, underscore a growing recognition of the influence of the global Mexican community. This election cycle is set to be a landmark moment, shaping the future of Mexico, and highlighting the critical role of its global citizenry.",

Other stars such as Queen Latifah and Cynthia Erivo also took the stage.\n\nBut the longest standing ovation was saved for the moment when the three presidents - Mr Biden, Mr Obama and Mr Clinton - came out.\n\nChants of \"four more years\" echoed throughout the auditorium for Mr Biden.\n\n\"Three presidents... and none of them are here [in New York] to go to court,\" joked comedian Stephen Colbert, alluding to Mr Trump's legal troubles.\n\nReuters The discussion between the three presidents was moderated by comedian Stephen Colbert.\n\nThe late-night comedy host then moderated a conversation between the three presidents.\n\nMr Biden began with an oft-repeated slogan, saying democracy was at stake in this election. He said Mr Trump had a \"perverse view of the world\", noting his opponent's vocal support of those who participated in the 6 January Capitol Riot and his buoying of authoritarian leaders abroad.\n\n\"But I'm really hopeful,\" the president added. \"If we get by this election, we can set the course for the next four, five, six decades.\"\n\nMr Obama, for his part, touted Biden's legislative victories. He said the president had done everything from reducing the cost of medicine to creating jobs - particularly for African Americans.\n\nHe added that Mr Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, and his supporters seemed \"increasingly unconcerned with the essence of America\", which he said was centred on the idea of \"bridging our differences and moving forward\".\n\nMr Clinton, meanwhile, accused Mr Trump of \"stealing a few good years\" from the back of Mr Obama's administration and somehow claiming \"overnight\" successes.\n\nThe four men ended their time on stage by putting on aviator sunglasses in an impression of Mr Biden, which earned a standing ovation.\n\nFirst Lady Jill Biden was due to host a private after-party for 500 guests. The president's son, Hunter Biden, and his family were to attend.\n\nThe tickets were priced between $225 and half-a-million dollars. For $100,000, guests could get a picture with Mr Biden, Mr Obama and Mr Clinton, with star photographer Annie Leibovitz taking the snaps.\n\nWhile the three presidents were on the same page during their time on stage, the event did not pass without incident.\n\nProtesters who condemn Israel for its invasion of the Gaza Strip gathered outside Radio City Music Hall to call for a ceasefire. Some were able to interrupt the event inside the theatre as well.\n\nMr Biden quickly took up the issue over the shouts of the protesters and to the applause of the crowd.\n\n\"There has to be a two-state solution, a progression,\" he said. \"But I'm confident that can be done with Israel's integrity... preserved.\"\n\nReuters Pro-Palestinian protesters were outside the event, and some were able to interrupt the fundraiser inside as well.\n\nThe Israel-Gaza war is one of the issues that has been dragging down Mr Biden's approval rating. Voters are also unhappy about the economy, inflation and immigration.\n\nFacing lagging approval ratings, the 81-year-old has worked to capitalise on momentum following his well-received State of the Union Address earlier this month.\n\nThe Biden campaign recently declared it had $155m cash on hand, which it said was the biggest war chest any Democratic candidate had ever possessed at this point in an election cycle.\n\nMr Trump and his political action committees reported having $74m.\n\nMore on the US election\n\nThe president's fundraising lead over Mr Trump - who is seeking a return to the White House four years after his presidency ended - has been boosted by the advantage of incumbency, experts say.\n\n\"Biden raising a lot of money is probably a function of him not having any real primary challengers,\" Joseph Campbell, a communications professor at American University, told the BBC. \"There's no competition for Democratic donor money.\"\n\nMr Trump's campaign and his joint fundraising committee - which have helped pay the former president's legal bills - brought in $20m in the whole of February, less than what the Biden campaign expects to receive just from Thursday's event.\n\nWhile Mr Biden has been criss-crossing the country in recent weeks, Mr Trump has kept a lower political profile as he juggles court appearances.\n\nBut he also appeared in the New York area on Thursday, attending the wake of a police officer, Jonathan Diller, who was shot and killed in the line of duty.\n\nHis campaign contrasted his attendance at the wake with Mr Biden's decision to attend \"a glitzy fundraiser in the city with their elitist, out-of-touch celebrity benefactors\" alongside Mr Obama and Mr Clinton.\n\nPresident Biden was joined on the Air Force One flight to New York by Mr Obama, who remains close to his former vice-president.\n\nWatch: Biden and Obama exit Air Force One in New York City to attend campaign fundraiser\n\nNew York ground to a halt for their arrival as the two men's huge motorcade cut across Manhattan in the pouring rain as hundreds of onlookers jostled to take pictures ahead of the fundraiser.\n\nMr Trump, 77, blasted the Democratic event in a fundraising campaign email on Thursday morning.\n\n\"Hundreds of deranged Hollywood liberals will be in attendance, and they will open their wallets to fund the destruction of this country!\" the message said.\n\nMr Biden's campaign has spent tens of millions on TV and digital advertising targeting black and Latino voters, as the president seeks to hold together the coalition that put him in the White House in the 2020 election.\n\nSome opinion polls have suggested that loyalty among these key voting blocs could be softening, though recent surveys show the president's approval could be beginning to rebound.\n\nThe 2024 presidential election cycle is predicted to be the most expensive in history, with an estimated $2.7bn spent on presidential campaign ads alone.\n\nIf you're in the UK, sign up here.",

        "text": "How Much Money Will Trump Spend on His Presidential Campaign in 2024?\nJ Scott Applewhite/AP/REX / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe name Donald Trump has been synonymous with money for decades, but the former president\u2019s finances have never endured more scrutiny than today. A series of civil and criminal cases are sapping his fortune and threatening his business empire \u2014 and then, of course, there\u2019s the little thing of funding a presidential campaign, which is one of the most expensive purchases money can buy.\n\nNet Worth: How Rich Is Former President Donald Trump?\n\nCheck Out: 5 Genius Things All Wealthy People Do With Their Money\n\nBut how much will Trump spend in his mission to evict Joe Biden from the White House, reclaim his place in the Oval Office and become the first president since Grover Cleveland to win a second nonconsecutive term?\n\nGOBankingRates asked political finance and campaign experts to examine the likely cost of Trump\u2019s campaign as America lurches toward its first presidential rematch since 1956, when Dwight Eisenhower defeated Adlai Stevenson for the second time.\n\nSponsored: Credit card debt keeping you up at night? Find out if you can reduce your debt with these 3 steps\n\nThe Price of the Presidency\n\nLike any modern presidential candidate, Trump will have to produce a mountain of cash to fund his campaign.\n\nAccording to OpenSecrets.org \u2014 a nonpartisan nonprofit that tracks money in politics \u2014 2020 upped the ante dramatically in an already expensive process. Here\u2019s what the presidential hopefuls have spent in all six 21st-century contests, including all money spent by candidates, political parties and independent special interest groups:\n\n2000: $1.4 billion\n\n2004: $1.9 billion\n\n2008: $2.8 billion\n\n2012: $2.6 billion\n\n2016: $2.4 billion\n\n2020: $5.7 billion\n\nAs you can see, the first showdown between Trump and Biden four years ago more than doubled the previous cycle\u2019s spending, but where does all the money go?\n\nFind Out: Here\u2019s How Much Every Living US President Is Worth: Where Does Biden Rank?\n\nWhat Do All Those Billions Buy?\n\nAccording to OpenSecrets, the Donald J. Trump for President 2024 committee has spent more than any other candidate-affiliated group in the current election cycle \u2014 $54,022,758 as of Feb. 2, compared to $37,502,043 for Biden for President.\n\nBut where does it all go and what does it pay for?\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s 2024 campaign is likely to incur significant expenses, including costs for advertising, travel, staff salaries and digital outreach efforts,\u201d said Eliana Martiin, political finance analyst, campaign strategist and CEO of the political advocacy firm QualifyCandidates. \u201cPrevious campaigns have shown a willingness to invest heavily in these areas to maximize visibility and voter engagement.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nAccording to OpenSecrets, this is how all combined presidential campaigns have spent their money so far in the 2024 election cycle: Media: 24.23%\n\nFundraising: 19.44%\n\nAdministrative costs: 15.35%\n\nUnclassifiable expenses: 14.65%\n\nSalaries: 13.71%\n\nCampaign expenses: 6.31%\n\nStrategy and research: 6.29% With nearly one dollar in five spent to raise more dollars, getting supporters to dig deep is the name of the game. \u201cFundraising will play a crucial role in financing Trump\u2019s campaign, with an emphasis on grassroots donations, high-dollar fundraisers and online contributions,\u201d said Martiin. \u201cThe campaign\u2019s ability to mobilize financial support from its base will be a key determinant of its overall budget.\u201d But that\u2019s shaping up to be a much heavier lift for Trump in 2024 than it was in 2020. Endless Legal Bills Are Gobbling Up Campaign Cash and Repelling Donors According to Forbes, Trump\u2019s litany of legal bills and civil judgments have topped a half-billion dollars so far, and the GOP candidate is scrambling to meet impending deadlines to secure bonds and/or put up the cash needed to file appeals himself. Other cases and lawsuits with potentially huge penalties are on the horizon, interest is accruing daily on some judgments and if Trump can\u2019t or won\u2019t pay, authorities can seize and sell his properties and other assets in some cases. So what does Trump\u2019s legal drama have to do with his campaign? Everything, because the latter is picking up the tab for the former. The Blurred Line Between Legal Fees and Campaign Spending According to the Associated Press, \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s legendary ability to raise massive sums of political cash may be on a collision course with a new and unpleasant reality.\u201d At the end of January, the Washington Post reported that Trump had spent $55 million in donor money not on his campaign, but on his legal bills. Even many die-hard supporters who were willing to spend their limited dollars to help Trump get elected balk at the prospect of paying a billionaire\u2019s lawyer bills. According to Bloomberg, the result is that the Trump campaign spent more than it raised in January, putting even more pressure on outside groups already buckling under the weight of his legal expenses. Politico reported that overall, the Trump campaign spent more than it received in all of 2023. The AP reports that Trump took in less than $14 million in January \u2014 a pittance by modern presidential campaign standards \u2014 compared to Joe Biden\u2019s $42 million in the same period. That leaves Trump\u2019s two committees with $36.6 million in cash on hand compared to Biden\u2019s $132 million war chest. Bloomberg predicts that at this rate, Trump\u2019s cash-crunched campaign will run out of money by July. Campaign on a Crash Diet: \u2018No More Than $3 Billion\u2019 The best way to project the cost of 2024 is to look back at 2020, the most expensive presidential campaign in U.S. history. \u201cWhen expenditures and debt incurred by the 2020 Trump campaign committee are added to expenditures by outside groups, the 2020 Trump campaign cost approximately $2.24 billion,\u201d said Michael Montgomery, a political scientist and former U.S. diplomat who advises nonprofit institutions on fundraising and resource development through his Montgomery Consulting firm and teaches part time in the Department of Health and Human Services at the University of Michigan-Dearborn. \u201cTo replicate the 2020 Trump campaign would cost $4.11 billion in 2024 dollars.\u201d But Trump does not have access to the same kind of cash or donor network today as he did four years ago. \u201cAt this point, the 2024 Trump campaign committee has raised $85 million and outside groups have raised $55 million for a total of $140 million, which is a long way from the level of funding that was available to the 2020 Trump campaign,\u201d said Montgomery, who cited FEC reporting and OpenSecrets data. \u201cMy guess? Total 2024 election cycle expenditures by the Trump campaign and outside organizations supporting Trump will come in at no more than $3 billion, making the 2024 Trump campaign a much less elaborate and expensive when adjusted for inflation than he had in 2020.\u201d More From GOBankingRates The Single Best Thing To Buy at Aldi in March 2024\n\n10 Cars That Outlast the Average Vehicle\n\nThis is One of the Best Ways to Boost Your Retirement Savings in 2024\n\n6 Things You Should Never Do With Your Tax Refund (Do This Instead) This article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: How Much Money Will Trump Spend on His Presidential Campaign in 2024?",

        "text": "Turkish vote: Battle to run Istanbul becomes key to country's future\nTurkish vote: Battle to run Istanbul becomes key to country's future\n\nNECATI SAVAS/EPA-EFE Until 2019, President Erdogan's AK Party had been in charge of Istanbul and Ankara for 25 years\n\nMillions of Turks have voted in elections to decide who runs their biggest cities - and whether President Recep Tayyip Erdogan can wrest back control from the opposition.\n\nTurkey's economic and social powerhouse, Istanbul, was won by a united opposition five years ago under popular mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, shattering the president's long run of electoral success.\n\nNow Mr Erdogan, who was born in this megacity of 16 million people, wants it back and the vote is on a knife-edge.\n\nWhatever happens in Istanbul is being seen as a crucial test of whether the opposition can pose a serious threat to Mr Erdogan and his AK Party in the next presidential elections in four years' time.\n\n\"Istanbul is his home. Losing Istanbul to the opposition in the 2019 local elections was devastating for him,\" says Ihsan Aktas of the department of communication at Istanbul Medipol University and chair of the Genar Political Research Centre.\n\nIstanbul was where he grew up, selling sesame bread snacks called Simits before going into politics in the 1970s.\n\nGetty Images Recep Tayyip Erdogan started his political career in Istanbul as a member of an Islamist Party\n\nHe headed an Islamist party's youth branch in the district of Beyogluthen, and rose through the ranks to become mayor, prime minister and ultimately president of Turkey.\n\nRecep Tayyip Erdogan secured a third term in presidential elections last year, but in this latest vote the main opposition party, the secular CHP, is hoping to hold on to big cities that it won back in dramatic fashion five years ago. Not just Istanbul, but the capital Ankara and the tourist city of Antalya.\n\nUntil 2019, the ruling AK Party and its Islamist predecessors had run the two biggest cities for 25 years.\n\nIn Istanbul the opposition even defeated his candidate twice, as the AKP alleged there had been irregularities and officials ordered a re-run.\n\nEPA Ekrem Imamoglu is seen as the biggest challenger for Mr Erdogan\n\n\"Although the opposition lost against Erdogan in last year's presidential election, there is still a strong link between winning Istanbul and winning Turkey,\" says Seda Demiralp, professor of political science at the city's Isik University.\n\n\"If Imamoglu manages to keep Istanbul, the opposition will still have high hopes for the upcoming 2028 presidential elections.\"\n\nIhsan Aktas agrees that whoever wins will have enormous influence beyond Istanbul: \"When you have the backing of Istanbul, you directly become an actor in the national politics. And globally too.\"\n\nThe city hosts a fifth of Turkey's population of nearly 85 million people, and it has a diverse electorate from different political, ethnic, religious and economic backgrounds.\n\nControl Istanbul and you control a significant portion of Turkey's economy including trade, tourism and finance.\n\nThe candidate chosen to run for Mr Erdogan's party in Istanbul is Murat Kurum, a 47-year-old former minister for the environment and urbanisation. But it may as well be a race between Ekrem Imamoglu and Mr Erdogan.\n\nA former businessman, 52-year-old Mr Imamoglu rose to prominence as mayor of the city's little-known middle-class district of Beylikduzu and he is viewed as President Erdogan's biggest challenger in decades.\n\nERDEM SAHIN/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock Supporters of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu attend an election campaign rally in March\n\n\"In 2019 we closed a chapter, and on 31 March, [the AKP] will be history,\" he told supporters at a rally in Beylikduzu.\n\nAnother victory would bolster his political clout and pave the way for him to run for the presidency in four years' time, political commentators say.\n\nThe mayor of Ankara, Mansur Yavas, has also been tipped to run in 2028 and his route to victory on Sunday is seen as more secure.\n\nFor now Ekrem Imamoglu is keeping his sights on his current job.\n\n\"I have big dreams for Istanbul, I don't dream of anything else, but just fulfilling them for now,\" he told Turkish daily Cumhuriyet.\n\nDuring his five years in office, Turkey has been in the grip of an economic crisis, although the mayor highlights an extension to the city's rail system, more green spaces and a major house-building programme.\n\nBut there is another major concern that grips the people of Istanbul.\n\nLast year's double earthquake in southern Turkey left more than 53,000 people dead and seismologists warn that a devastating quake may hit Istanbul at any moment.\n\nPlans to demolish old, dilapidated buildings and build earthquake-resistant replacements are top of the agenda for the AKP.\n\n\"Murat Kurum is a name identified with urban development, and has a symbolic significance,\" says Ms Demiralp, but still \"it may not be enough to secure a victory\".\n\nEPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock President Erdogan (R) joins his Istanbul mayoral candidate Murat Kurum (L) at the party's rallies\n\nPresident Erdogan and top ministers have made winning back Istanbul a personal goal, promising a new era from 31 March.\n\n\"Istanbul will be returned to its real owner,\" he promised hundreds of thousands of supporters at a rally in the city.\n\nNow aged 70, he has previously said these will be his last elections. He is in his third term as president and cannot rule beyond 2028 under the constitution.\n\nBut he hasn't picked any successors yet and Ihsan Akstas says pinpointing who might replace him as head of the AKP is extremely difficult.\n\n\"When we ask pollsters who they would like to see replacing Erdogan, they cannot think of anyone. This is a challenge for the party.\"\n\nGetty Images Istanbul has a population of 16 million and is Turkey's biggest city by far\n\nThat is why Mr Erdogan's critics believe winning back Istanbul might be used to consolidate his power at both the national and local level, with potential changes to the constitution that would grant him yet another term as president.\n\nUnlike recent elections, he also has an advantage in that the opposition is no longer united and polls suggest the race in Istanbul could be neck and neck.\n\nEkrem Imamoglu won in 2019 backed by a six-party coalition of nationalists, secularists, liberals, conservatives, Islamists and, most crucially, the Kurds. Istanbul has a very large Kurdish population.\n\nBut that opposition collapsed after last year's presidential defeat and the other opposition parties, including the pro-Kurdish DEM Party, have their own candidates in this race.",

        "text": "2024 Delegate Selection Process\nAhead of the 2024 Democratic National Convention, the Delaware Democratic Party will select a small delegation of local Democrats, party leaders, and elected officials to formally nominate the Democratic nominee for U.S. President.\n\n2024 the Democratic Party will formally nominate Joe Biden and Kamala Harris for re-election at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Chicago, Illinois. Democrats from all 50 states and the 7 territories will gather in the Windy City to complete the nomination process, conduct party business, and kick off the General Election season. For its role in this process, Delaware must send a small delegation of local Democrats, party leaders, and elected officials to Chicago for the 2024 Democratic National Convention. The process for selecting Delaware Delegation is outlined in the 2024 Delegate Selection Plan found at the bottom of this page.\n\nThank you to all of the Delaware Democrats who have participated in the Delegate Selection Process so far. As of March 19, the application period for this year's process has closed.\n\n2024 Delegate Selection Caucus, April 13\n\nDelaware\u2019s 2024 Delegate Selection Process will culminate in a Delegate Selection Caucus (DSC) at Bally's Dover Casino Resort on Saturday, April 13, 2024. At this State Caucus, Delaware will elect its Democratic National Convention Delegates. Those elected will attend the 2024 National Convention in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nCheck-in will open at 9:00 am. Upon checking in, Caucus Electors and DNC Delegate Candidates will receive their credentials. While only Caucus Electors and Delegate Candidates will have an official role in the Caucus, the event is open to all registered Democrats. Guests and spectators will also need to check in to gain access to the DSC. Guests are strongly encouraged to pre-register ahead of time to expedite their check-in process. To register as a guest click here.\n\nCaucus Electors\n\nThe voting body of the DSC is made of Caucus Electors. In February, each Rep. District convened to elect a slate of up to four local Democrats to serve on the district's behalf at the DSC. The Caucus Electors will vote on who becomes a National Convention Delegate.\n\nThe roster of caucus electors will be made available upon request to any registered Delaware Democrat. To request the roster please email dnc2024@deldems.org with your name and voting address (to confirm registration).\n\nNational Committee Member Elections\n\nThe first order of business will be to elect Delaware\u2019s two (2) Democratic National Committee members. These members serve as Delaware\u2019s representatives on the Democratic National Committee and attend biannual meetings at their own expense. The four-year term for the members elected at this year's caucus will begin immediately after the 2024 National Convention. The newly elected members will not be a part of the 2024 National Convention Delegation and will instead attend the 2028 National Convention. Delaware\u2019s current National Committee members, Sean Finnigan and Kerri Evelyn Harris, will attend this Summer\u2019s National Convention.\n\nNominations for National Committee Members will be taken from the floor. Any registered Delaware Democrat is eligible to serve as a National Committee Member. National Committee Member positions are gender balanced, meaning the two members may not be of the same gender.\n\nNational Convention Delegate Elections\n\nFollowing the election of National Committee Members, Caucus Electors will split off into Subdivision Groups. These groups will then elect their subdivision's National Convention Delegates. The subdivision delegates to the national convention are allocated among Delaware\u2019s four subdivisions (Kent County, New Castle County, Sussex County, and Wilmington City) based on the vote share of the 2020 Presidential and Gubernatorial candidates. Delegates are distributed as follows\n\n2 Kent Delegates\n\n6 New Castle Delegates\n\n2 Sussex Delegates\n\n2 Wilmington Delegates\n\nAfter each of the subdivisions have elected their delegates, the full caucus body will reconvene to elect the remaining At-Large(5), Alternate(2), and Party Leader(2) delegates. After the last delegate has been elected the caucus will vote to affirm the appointment of Convention Committee Members. The meeting will then adjourn.\n\n\n\nDelegate Selection Plan Overview\n\nAfter a thorough review and public comment period, 2024 Delaware's Delegate Selection plan was formally approved by the National Party's Rules and Bylaws Committee in October of 2023. The plan details the Delaware Democratic Party's commitment to a fair, accessible, and transparent process that ensures that Delaware's 2024 Democratic National Convention delegation reflects the party locally.\n\nDelaware's Delegation\n\nDelaware is slated to send 34 total delegates and two (2) alternates to the Democratic National Convention. In addition, Delaware will send three (3) convention pages and three (3) standing committee members to next summer's Democratic convention.\n\n12 Subdivision/District Level Delegates\n\n5 At-Large Delegates\n\n2 Pledged Party Leader & Elected Official Delegates\n\n15 Automatic Party Leader & Elected Official Delegates (to be finalized in March 2024)\n\n2 At-Large Alternates\n\nAll local registered Democrats are encouraged to participate in the process, which will begin fielding applications in early 2024. Through the Winter and Spring of 2024, the state and local parties will host a series of public caucuses and meetings to decide on Delaware\u2019s delegation. Rep. District level caucuses will take place in February to select electors to the State level caucus. On April 13, 2024, electors will gather in Dover for the 2024 Delegate Selection Caucus. Those selected as delegates will travel to Chicago, Illinois for the 2024 Democratic National Convention where the Party will formally make its nomination for President.\n\nBasic Procedure\n\nThroughout the Winter and Spring of 2024, local Democrats will have a chance to participate in Delaware's Delegate Selection Process. Those selected as delegates will participate in the 2024 Democratic National Convention in Chicago.\n\nBeginning January 3, National Convention Delegate Applications will be available online and at State Party Headquarters. Those wishing to become a DNC Delegate will need to submit their completed application form by March 19, 2024.\n\nIn February 2024 the local party will host a series of Representative District Caucuses. A caucus will be held for each of the 41 State Representative (House) Districts. At these District Caucuses, four(4) resident Democrats will be selected to serve as electors at the 2024 State Caucus. Serving as an elector is not a requirement to become a DNC Delegate.\n\nThe electors from each State House District will gather in Dover on Saturday, April 13 for the 2024 Delegate Selection Caucus where they will vote on Delaware's DNC Delegates.\n\nKey Delegate Selection Dates\n\nThere are several key dates in the Delegate Selection Process",

A series of civil and criminal cases are sapping his fortune and threatening his business empire \u2014 and then, of course, there\u2019s the little thing of funding a presidential campaign, which is one of the most expensive purchases money can buy.\n\nNet Worth: How Rich Is Former President Donald Trump?\n\nCheck Out: 5 Genius Things All Wealthy People Do With Their Money\n\nBut how much will Trump spend in his mission to evict Joe Biden from the White House, reclaim his place in the Oval Office and become the first president since Grover Cleveland to win a second nonconsecutive term?\n\nGOBankingRates asked political finance and campaign experts to examine the likely cost of Trump\u2019s campaign as America lurches toward its first presidential rematch since 1956, when Dwight Eisenhower defeated Adlai Stevenson for the second time.\n\nSponsored: Credit card debt keeping you up at night? Find out if you can reduce your debt with these 3 steps\n\nThe Price of the Presidency\n\nLike any modern presidential candidate, Trump will have to produce a mountain of cash to fund his campaign.\n\nAccording to OpenSecrets.org \u2014 a nonpartisan nonprofit that tracks money in politics \u2014 2020 upped the ante dramatically in an already expensive process. Here\u2019s what the presidential hopefuls have spent in all six 21st-century contests, including all money spent by candidates, political parties and independent special interest groups:\n\n2000: $1.4 billion\n\n2004: $1.9 billion\n\n2008: $2.8 billion\n\n2012: $2.6 billion\n\n2016: $2.4 billion\n\n2020: $5.7 billion\n\nAs you can see, the first showdown between Trump and Biden four years ago more than doubled the previous cycle\u2019s spending, but where does all the money go?\n\nFind Out: Here\u2019s How Much Every Living US President Is Worth: Where Does Biden Rank?\n\nWhat Do All Those Billions Buy?\n\nAccording to OpenSecrets, the Donald J. Trump for President 2024 committee has spent more than any other candidate-affiliated group in the current election cycle \u2014 $54,022,758 as of Feb. 2, compared to $37,502,043 for Biden for President.\n\nBut where does it all go and what does it pay for?\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s 2024 campaign is likely to incur significant expenses, including costs for advertising, travel, staff salaries and digital outreach efforts,\u201d said Eliana Martiin, political finance analyst, campaign strategist and CEO of the political advocacy firm QualifyCandidates. \u201cPrevious campaigns have shown a willingness to invest heavily in these areas to maximize visibility and voter engagement.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nAccording to OpenSecrets, this is how all combined presidential campaigns have spent their money so far in the 2024 election cycle: Media: 24.23%\n\nFundraising: 19.44%\n\nAdministrative costs: 15.35%\n\nUnclassifiable expenses: 14.65%\n\nSalaries: 13.71%\n\nCampaign expenses: 6.31%\n\nStrategy and research: 6.29% With nearly one dollar in five spent to raise more dollars, getting supporters to dig deep is the name of the game. \u201cFundraising will play a crucial role in financing Trump\u2019s campaign, with an emphasis on grassroots donations, high-dollar fundraisers and online contributions,\u201d said Martiin. \u201cThe campaign\u2019s ability to mobilize financial support from its base will be a key determinant of its overall budget.\u201d But that\u2019s shaping up to be a much heavier lift for Trump in 2024 than it was in 2020. Endless Legal Bills Are Gobbling Up Campaign Cash and Repelling Donors According to Forbes, Trump\u2019s litany of legal bills and civil judgments have topped a half-billion dollars so far, and the GOP candidate is scrambling to meet impending deadlines to secure bonds and/or put up the cash needed to file appeals himself. Other cases and lawsuits with potentially huge penalties are on the horizon, interest is accruing daily on some judgments and if Trump can\u2019t or won\u2019t pay, authorities can seize and sell his properties and other assets in some cases. So what does Trump\u2019s legal drama have to do with his campaign? Everything, because the latter is picking up the tab for the former. The Blurred Line Between Legal Fees and Campaign Spending According to the Associated Press, \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s legendary ability to raise massive sums of political cash may be on a collision course with a new and unpleasant reality.\u201d At the end of January, the Washington Post reported that Trump had spent $55 million in donor money not on his campaign, but on his legal bills. Even many die-hard supporters who were willing to spend their limited dollars to help Trump get elected balk at the prospect of paying a billionaire\u2019s lawyer bills. According to Bloomberg, the result is that the Trump campaign spent more than it raised in January, putting even more pressure on outside groups already buckling under the weight of his legal expenses. Politico reported that overall, the Trump campaign spent more than it received in all of 2023. The AP reports that Trump took in less than $14 million in January \u2014 a pittance by modern presidential campaign standards \u2014 compared to Joe Biden\u2019s $42 million in the same period. That leaves Trump\u2019s two committees with $36.6 million in cash on hand compared to Biden\u2019s $132 million war chest. Bloomberg predicts that at this rate, Trump\u2019s cash-crunched campaign will run out of money by July. Campaign on a Crash Diet: \u2018No More Than $3 Billion\u2019 The best way to project the cost of 2024 is to look back at 2020, the most expensive presidential campaign in U.S. history. \u201cWhen expenditures and debt incurred by the 2020 Trump campaign committee are added to expenditures by outside groups, the 2020 Trump campaign cost approximately $2.24 billion,\u201d said Michael Montgomery, a political scientist and former U.S. diplomat who advises nonprofit institutions on fundraising and resource development through his Montgomery Consulting firm and teaches part time in the Department of Health and Human Services at the University of Michigan-Dearborn. \u201cTo replicate the 2020 Trump campaign would cost $4.11 billion in 2024 dollars.\u201d But Trump does not have access to the same kind of cash or donor network today as he did four years ago. \u201cAt this point, the 2024 Trump campaign committee has raised $85 million and outside groups have raised $55 million for a total of $140 million, which is a long way from the level of funding that was available to the 2020 Trump campaign,\u201d said Montgomery, who cited FEC reporting and OpenSecrets data. \u201cMy guess? Total 2024 election cycle expenditures by the Trump campaign and outside organizations supporting Trump will come in at no more than $3 billion, making the 2024 Trump campaign a much less elaborate and expensive when adjusted for inflation than he had in 2020.\u201d More From GOBankingRates The Single Best Thing To Buy at Aldi in March 2024\n\n10 Cars That Outlast the Average Vehicle\n\nThis is One of the Best Ways to Boost Your Retirement Savings in 2024\n\n6 Things You Should Never Do With Your Tax Refund (Do This Instead) This article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: How Much Money Will Trump Spend on His Presidential Campaign in 2024?",

        "text": "Senegal: From Constitutional Crisis to Democratic Restoration\nAfter a series of setbacks and doubts as to whether Senegal\u2019s presidential election would actually take place before the end of President Macky Sall\u2019s term on April 2, the election was held on March 24 without any major incidents and in a transparent manner.1 A few hours after the polls closed, partial results were already pointing to a first-round winner: Bassirou Diomaye Faye, the candidate of the most outspoken opposition to the incumbent government, and second in command of the African Patriots of Senegal for Work, Ethics and Fraternity party (PASTEF). Released from prison just ten days before the election after eleven months in pretrial detention, the forty-four-year-old former tax inspector will be the youngest and most unexpected president in the history of independent Senegal. He will be the continent\u2019s youngest serving president when he takes office in April.2\n\nBefore his presidential candidacy, Faye was little known to the Senegalese public, working in the shadow of party leader Ousmane Sonko. Sonko, also a former tax official, emerged in recent years as the most outspoken political opponent of Sall\u2019s government. Sonko gained popularity, especially among young people, for his highly critical discourse on the traditional political class and for his promises of a radical break from how the country has been governed for decades.\n\nOn the evening of April 2, Sall will step down after twelve years at the helm of the country. He will hand over power to a young president from a political party that his government officially dissolved in July 2023, whose \u201cradical\u201d style he found unsettling. To many, Sall\u2019s final months in office have been a political failure, tarnishing a solid record of infrastructure development and diplomatic activity on the African and international stage. In his efforts to neutralize his main political opponents, Sall has instead facilitated their uncontested victory. However, by permitting the electoral administration to play its role without further political interference, Sall allowed Senegal to reach a peaceful and democratic conclusion to three years of political tension, violence, and uncertainty.\n\nThreats to Senegal\u2019s Democratic Credibility\n\nOn February 3, 2024, Sall launched the country into a political and constitutional crisis when he announced his decision to postpone the presidential election planned for February 25. Sall\u2019s announcement preceded a bill in the Senegalese Parliament that moved to officially change the election date to December 15, 2024, effectively extending Sall\u2019s term in office. Senegalese citizens responded with mass demonstrations, and the state cut mobile internet access and deployed large police forces to its major cities, resulting in the loss of four lives.3\n\nOn February 15, Senegal\u2019s Constitutional Council\u2014the country\u2019s highest constitutional court, whose members are appointed by the president\u2014ruled that Sall\u2019s decree to move the election date and Parliament\u2019s subsequent bill were unconstitutional. The council urged Sall to set the earliest possible date for the election and confirmed that Sall\u2019s five-year presidential term would end on April 2. In place of the scheduled February 25 election, the government held a two-day \u201cNational Dialogue\u201d on February 26 and 27 that brought together a wide range of representatives of political parties, civil society organizations, and religious groups. However, opposition candidates voiced concerns that Sall\u2019s National Dialogue was about \u201cslowing down the election,\u201d and demanded that Sall set a presidential election date as soon as possible.4 Following a Constitutional Council ruling that rejected the postponement of the election beyond the end of Sall\u2019s electoral mandate, Sall announced on March 6 that the election would take place on March 24.\n\nThomas Carothers and Benjamin Press, in a paper on global democratic backsliding, argue that for a country to be considered a \u201cdemocratic backslider,\u201d it must have \u201cachieved a significant level of democracy\u201d and then \u201cexperienced significant erosion of democratic institutions,\u201d often at the hand of \u201cpurposeful elite actors.\u201d5 Senegal has long been heralded as one of the few stable democracies in West Africa, a region that has seen a trend of democratic backsliding since 2020, with coups d\u2019\u00e9tat in Burkina Faso, Guinea, Mali, and Niger. However, threats to the country\u2019s democratic credibility had been simmering for quite some time, and until the March 24 election seemed to temporarily place Senegal in the category of a \u201cdemocratic backslider.\u201d\n\nSenegal\u2019s current constitution grants presidents a maximum of two consecutive terms of office. However, presidential term limits have been a consistent source of turmoil for Senegal. When Sall\u2019s predecessor, Abdoulaye Wade, was elected to office in 2000, Senegal did not yet have term limits. After Wade changed the constitution to ensure a two-term limit, he positioned himself for a third term in 2012, arguing that constitutionally mandated term limits were not retroactive. Amid widespread protests, Sall emerged as the leading opposition figure, promising constitutional reform. In his first term, which ran from 2012 to 2019, Sall reduced the presidential term from seven to five years. However, two years into his second term, Sall seemed to be positioning himself for a third by refusing to publicly state his political intentions beyond his mandate.\n\nMore broadly, Sall\u2019s two terms in office have marked trends in the restriction of political participation in Senegal, as shown in figure 1. Sall\u2019s reelection in 2019 came after the Constitutional Council ruled that two of Sall\u2019s major opposition candidates were ineligible to run for president because of their convictions in separate corruption cases. Those corruption cases were widely seen as \u201can effort [by the Sall administration] to neutralize\u201d Sall\u2019s most powerful political opponents.6\n\nIn addition, Sall\u2019s administration moved to limit freedom of the press and freedom of speech. In 2021, Sall signed into law a press code that allowed for a two-year prison term for \u201cdefamation\u201d and up to three years for publishing \u201cfake news\u201d that could \u201cdiscredit public institutions\u201d or \u201cprejudice public decency.\u201d The Senegalese government moved to ban numerous opposition rallies and protests and heavily strengthened its paramilitary force, the National Gendarmerie, with waves of recruits and equipment to respond to protesters.\n\nThe state has made the draconian move of shutting down internet and social media access on mobile phones several times. In March 2021, the Senegalese state suspended two television stations and restricted access to social media applications and phone data services.7 In June and July 2023, the Senegalese government again restricted access to internet services and social media, citing the \u201cdissemination of hateful and subversive messages.\u201d8 Most recently, on February 13, 2024, the state shut off mobile internet access following Sall\u2019s announcement that the election date would be moved.9\n\nOne of the key players in Senegal\u2019s political landscape over the past five years is Ousmane Sonko, who rose to fame for denouncing corruption and criticizing Sall\u2019s administration while working as a government tax inspector. He emerged as a popular opposition leader with PASTEF during the 2019 presidential election. Although Sall was reelected, Sonko continued to rally youth in enormous numbers with his promises to fight government corruption. In 2021, Sonko was accused of \u201crape and death threats\u201d by an employee of a Dakar beauty salon, inflaming his supporters, who took to the streets to protest what they perceived as an attempt by the Sall administration to undercut a rising opposition movement.10 Sonko did not attend his trial and was sentenced in absentia to two years in prison for \u201ccorrupting youth\u201d on June 1, 2023, but acquitted of charges of rape and death threats.11\n\nFollowing this sentence, and after months of tension, Sonko was arrested in late July 2023 for \u201ccalling for insurrection, criminal conspiracy in connection with a terrorist undertaking and undermining state security\u201d and imprisoned.12 PASTEF was dissolved by the government on July 31 with an official statement by Senegal\u2019s interior minister accusing the party of having encouraged \u201cinsurrectional movements [with] serious consequences,\u201d including \u201closs of life\u201d and \u201clooting of public and private property.\u201d13 In the end, it was the Supreme Court\u2019s confirmation on January 4, 2024, of Sonko\u2019s suspended six-month prison sentence for defamation of a minister that led to his removal from the electoral roll and his exclusion from the presidential election.\n\nBreakdown of Political Norms\n\nIn addition to threats to Senegal\u2019s democratic stability, the past years have seen a breakdown of political norms and an increase in violence in the political arena. In the view of Sall\u2019s presidential camp, Sonko\u2014along with PASTEF\u2014represents a \u201cthreat\u201d to Senegal, particularly because of his alleged proximity to Islamist circles and his populist views. Sonko, for his part, is not one to shy away from inflammatory language. He has called for France to stop \u201csuck[ing] the blood of its ex\u00ad-colonies,\u201d supported the end of the French-inherited currency (CFA franc) and more generally campaigned for the end of economic and political influence from France and other external actors he believes to be detrimental to Senegal\u2019s national interests.14 At a January 2023 rally of his supporters, Sonko invoked the Wolof phrase gatsa-gatsa, or \u201ceye for an eye, tooth for a tooth,\u201d urging the crowd to \u201cfight\u201d against Sall \u201cwhatever it costs\u201d: \u201ceither [Sall] kills us or we kill him.\u201d15 In response to Sonko\u2019s June 2023 sentencing, PASTEF urged Senegalese citizens to \u201cmassively descend on the streets.\u201d16\n\nDemonstrations by Sonko\u2019s supporters have led to unprecedented levels of violence and destruction, shocking in a country where political tensions rarely escalate to this level. Protests in both 2021 and 2023 saw security forces fire tear gas and live and rubber bullets against protesters. They also set storefronts and government-owned buses on fire, blocked roads, built barricades, and threw stones at police forces.17 In March 2021, after Sonko was arrested and charged with \u201cdisturbing public order,\u201d massive protests led to the use of live bullets by police forces, leaving at least fourteen dead and hundreds injured.18 In June 2023, protests following Sonko\u2019s sentencing led to sixteen deaths and 500 arrests, with various witnesses reporting armed civilians attacking protesters alongside security forces, as well as the use of live bullets.19\n\nFollowing February\u2019s protests against Sall\u2019s election postponement attempt, Human Rights Watch called for an investigation into abuses by security forces toward Senegalese citizens, including the use of live and rubber bullets and tear gas at close range.20 Amnesty International similarly called for the Senegalese government to investigate the \u201cescalating repression and brutality\u201d of Senegalese police forces against protesters and members of the press.21\n\nSall\u2019s Political Calculations\n\nMost observers of the political scene in Senegal are convinced that Sall\u2019s move to postpone the election was not due to technical unpreparedness or exceptional circumstances but was rather a strategic ploy to organize a later election in a more favorable political context and with a potentially changed list of candidates.22 If Sall had successfully delayed the election, he would not only have extended his presidential term but allowed his party to better position its preferred candidate for victory.23 Political scientist Moussa Diaw described the election postponement as a \u201cpolitical maneuver\u201d born of a \u201cfake [governmental] crisis.\u201d24\n\nFor the 2024 election, Senegalese citizens had a choice between nineteen candidates, compared to five in the 2019 presidential election. The list included some of the country\u2019s leading political figures, including former prime minister Amadou Ba, the candidate chosen by Sall\u2019s coalition; former prime minister and runner-up in the 2019 presidential election Idrissa Seck; former Dakar mayor Khalifa Sall; and PASTEF\u2019s Faye. Faye was kept in pretrial detention beginning in April 2023, after he was accused of \u201cacts likely to compromise public peace,\u201d contempt of court, and defamation, until his release from prison in March 2024.25 Following PASTEF\u2019s dissolution and Sonko\u2019s removal from the electoral roll, Sonko officially endorsed Faye as his replacement in the presidential election.26\n\nSall\u2019s decision to choose Ba as his preferred candidate displeased many members of his presidential camp. Just days before Sall\u2019s announcement that he would move the election date, lawmakers from Sall\u2019s own ruling party accused two Constitutional Council judges of corruption, claiming that Ba had bribed them to remove one of his key opponents, Karim Wade, from the candidates list. Ba was not considered a popular figure, including within his own party, many of whom believed he had only a slim chance of winning. In addition, his candidacy emerged in an unfavorable political context for the ruling camp. The hardening of power over the past three years, marked by the systematic banning of public demonstrations, the arrest of numerous journalists and activists critical of the government, and the prosecution of his main political opponent, Sonko, made Sall increasingly unpopular.27\n\nIt is possible that Sall had clear insight into voter trends in the run-up to the election. One hypothesis is that Sall aimed to gain time to avoid the risk of seeing his camp lose the election, forcing him to hand over the presidency to opponents from the newly dissolved PASTEF.28 If Sall had been able to decide the timing and conditions of the election, he could have expected to significantly improve the chances of his chosen successor\u2019s victory. When a president leaves office, he or she is likely to want to hand over power to someone from his or her own political camp or groom a successor. If an outgoing president fears that his political adversaries will settle the score with legal proceedings, the desire to choose a trusted successor may be even stronger.\n\nThe reasons behind Sall\u2019s decision remain difficult to understand. In July 2023, after weeks of violent protests, he announced in a speech that he would not be a candidate in the February 2024 presidential election. Like his predecessor, Wade, he stressed that his candidacy would not have violated the constitution. However, a third term was not in line with his personal commitments. Most observers felt that Sall made this decision only after facing pressure from the opposition, civil society organizations, and Senegal\u2019s major external partners, including the United States and France.29\n\nSall\u2019s rationale has undermined his continental leadership and potential future as a statesman and former president who once presided over a democratic transition. He previously served as chairman of the Assembly of the African Union and was one of the most prominent and successful voices to advocate for an African Union seat in the G20. In a controversial move in November 2023, French President Emmanuel Macron appointed Sall as special envoy and chairman of the follow-up committee to the Paris Pact for People and the Planet. Some talked about the possibility of Sall taking on an international post as prestigious as that of the Secretary General of the United Nations. These prospects may have receded considerably after recent events, which have done serious damage to Sall\u2019s international reputation.30\n\nUnable to take part in the elections, unsure of the victory of his candidate or even of Ba\u2019s absolute loyalty after the elections, and unable to rule out a PASTEF presidential victory, it would appear that Sall used the final tool available to him by announcing an amnesty law during his National Dialogue. This amnesty law would guarantee immunity for all perpetrators of violence during political demonstrations between 2021 and 2024.31 On March 6, it was passed by the Senegalese Parliament. Importantly for Sall, the law would protect not only protesters but also members of the security forces and those responsible at the highest levels of Senegal\u2019s security apparatus and political circles. This maneuver allowed for the release of Sall\u2019s political opponents, including Sonko and Faye, while offering Sall and those close to him guarantees of security for the period following his departure from power. After using the stick, the president\u2019s camp seems to have opted for the carrot to limit the risk of a catastrophic end to Sall\u2019s final term.\n\nSenegal on the International Stage\n\nSince its independence, Senegal has maintained strong relationships with the United States, France, and other Western powers. The United States was very clear in its condemnation of the attempt to postpone the presidential election. In a telephone call on February 13, U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken spoke to Sall and urged him \u201cto restore Senegal\u2019s electoral calendar and presidential transition timetable in accordance with Senegal\u2019s constitution.\u201d32 \u00adOn March 27, in a White House statement, President Joe Biden also congratulated Faye on his election and sent \u201cwarm wishes\u201d to Senegalese citizens, who demonstrated that \u201cthe right to vote\u2014and have that vote counted\u2014remains democracy\u2019s threshold liberty.\u201d33\n\nAt the same time, in recent years, Senegal has moved to deepen its relationships with China and Russia. Senegal has a strong trade relationship with China and has worked over the past decade to strengthen the diplomatic relationship between the two countries. In June 2023, Sall, along with other African leaders, traveled to Ukraine and Russia, where in conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin, he urged the peaceful resolution of Russia\u2019s conflict with Ukraine.34 Just a month later, Sall joined the Russia-Africa Summit to engage in discussion on developing bilateral relations and broader Russian-African cooperation.\n\nSenegal has also expressed interest in joining the BRICS bloc of emerging economies, which positions itself as a champion of a more multilateral global order.35 BRICS has called for the reform of various Western-led organizations including the United Nations and the World Bank.36 In August 2023, BRICS admitted five new members: Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. With this expansion, the group now contains some of the West\u2019s strongest rivals. With a deepening divergence in global order between Western and non-Western powers, Senegal\u2019s future approach to diplomacy could have significant political and economic implications.\n\nIn June 2023, Senegal followed in the steps of South Africa, Indonesia, and Vietnam to sign a $2.7 billion Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) with Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the European Union. Senegal\u2019s JETP aims to increase the country\u2019s renewable energy capacity to 40 percent of its electricity generation.37 Yet Senegal\u2019s green energy transition will very likely take a backseat to oil and gas. More than 40 trillion cubic feet of natural gas was discovered during Sall\u2019s first term in office, positioning Senegal for enormous potential economic growth.38 Sall, for his part, championed the use of fossil fuels to support Senegal\u2019s industrialization and development, stating that natural gas would help the country transition away from oil. However, Senegal will need to strike a delicate balance between its domestic priorities and those of the international climate community. The prospect of significant financial gains from this sector vastly increased the stakes of the competition for political power and the overall significance of this year\u2019s presidential election.\n\nSall\u2019s time in office saw the implementation of ambitious infrastructure projects, including roads, railways, and urban transports. The country\u2019s GDP grew 4.1 percent in 2023 with predicted growth at 8.8 percent and 10.2 percent for 2024 and 2025 respectively.39 However, the country has seen limited economic diversification, structural change, and job creation for young people. Despite a growing workforce, youth unemployment is at 20 percent and the informal economy dominates.40 Inflation-linked high cost of living, unemployment, poverty, and lack of social services have led to general discontent and sowed the seeds of political unrest.\n\nPeriods of political unrest in Senegal have had direct effects on the country\u2019s economic status, both domestically and abroad. The protests of June 2023 led not only to the destruction of tens of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of infrastructure and public transportation but a shutdown of normal economic activity.41 The Senegalese government has estimated that even a single day of protests can slow the country\u2019s economic output by up to $33 million, with the heaviest burden felt by those in the informal sector.42 Beyond the country\u2019s borders, a \u201cpositive perception\u201d of Senegal is crucial to ensure continued foreign investment, as any changes to the country\u2019s risk assessment would cause serious financial consequences.43\n\nWhat\u2019s Next for Senegal Under President Faye?\n\nFollowing the passing of Sall\u2019s amnesty law, on March 15, Sonko and Faye were released from prison.44 With the backing of more than a dozen of the nineteen presidential candidates on the electoral roll and the support of important political figures (including Aminata Tour\u00e9, Sall\u2019s former close ally and prime minister), Faye was in an unusually good position despite having only nine days to campaign before the election.45 Faye\u2019s campaign slogan\u2014\u201cDiomaye mooy Sonko,\u201d meaning \u201cDiomaye is Sonko\u201d\u2014pledged his alliance to his fellow opposition figure; a vote for Faye was also a vote for Sonko.46 On March 24, more than 5 million of the 7.3 million Senegalese citizens registered to vote took to the polls to choose their preferred candidate.47 After Senegalese local media announced that Faye had won more than 50 percent of the votes, Ba officially conceded defeat.48 According to the official provisional results announced on March 27, Faye won 54.28 percent of the vote in the election, compared with 35.79 percent for Ba.49\n\nThis election was a victory for the citizens who mobilized and organized to demand that the election be held before the end of Sall\u2019s presidential term and who undoubtedly influenced the decision of the Constitutional Council, which went against the wishes of Sall and his political allies. It was a victory for those who defend democracy and the rule of law over the interests of those in power. In a West African context, where military rulers have been installed by coups d\u2019\u00e9tat and elected civilian rulers have tried to cling to power by manipulating constitutions, a transparent election in Senegal that resulted in an uncontested victory for the opposition is uplifting to the entire region.\n\nThe arrival of Faye and PASTEF to power is obviously no guarantee that the promises of changes to political practices and the management of public resources, or of addressing the pressing economic and social needs of young people, will be kept. The platform presented by PASTEF is ambitious, emphasizing the party\u2019s desire for Senegal to make more sovereign economic decisions and its refusal to accept the dictates of international institutions.50 However, the next administration will have to ensure that the Senegalese government honors its previous commitments, properly manages the country\u2019s foreign debt (which has increased significantly during the Sall years), and maintains good relations with international partners who have interests in Senegal\u2019s burgeoning oil and gas resources.\n\nSenegal\u2019s currency was one of the most debated issues during the election season and will continue to be so following Faye\u2019s victory. PASTEF\u2019s manifesto calls for Senegal to leave the CFA franc, which is pegged to the euro under an agreement with France, in favor of a national Senegalese currency.51 However, PASTEF leaders are aware of the contradiction that could exist between their pan-Africanist ideals and the hard realities of the fiscal and monetary policy as well as regional implications of leaving the CFA franc. Senegal is the largest economy after C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire in the subgroup of West African countries that share the CFA franc and a major diplomatic player within the wider bloc of the fifteen ECOWAS countries, three of which\u2014the military coup\u2013led Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger\u2014announced their withdrawal from the bloc in February 2024. In mid-March, Faye\u2019s election campaign said it would be necessary to try a region-wide implementation of a single currency at the level of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) before opting for a nationwide change to Senegal\u2019s currency.52\n\nThe new Senegalese president\u2019s positions on the complex political and security issues in the Sahel, the management of military transitions in the region, and the development of relations between Senegal and France will also be closely scrutinized.53 In his first speech as president-elect, Faye sought to reassure his country\u2019s external partners, declaring that Senegal \u201cwill remain a friendly country and a safe and reliable ally for any partner who engages with us in virtuous, respectful and mutually productive cooperation.\u201d54 On March 25, Macron congratulated Faye on his election and said he looked forward to working together.55\n\nThis surprising political change in Senegal has raised immense hopes. The immediate impact on the country\u2019s international image is undeniably positive. With Faye and a new generation of political leaders taking office, a new chapter in the country\u2019s political history will begin, bringing real opportunities for positive change, but also its share of uncertainties. The continued commitment of a large section of Senegalese society to more virtuous governance, stronger democratic institutions, and effective, realistic public policies will be crucial if the political breakthrough sought by the electorate is to translate into real improvements in people\u2019s lives.\n\nNotes\n\n1 Ruth Maclean, \u201cYoung Opposition Candidate Set to Become Senegal\u2019s

        "text": "What role should age play in a presidential election?\nOn February 19, 2024, Colorado State University's Center for Healthy Aging hosted an event on age limits for politicians, at which Division 20 past-president Manfred Diehl was one of the four panelists. Current Division 20 president Grace Caskie invited Diehl to summarize the thoughts and points he made at this event to share more broadly with Division 20 members. We greatly appreciate his willingness to write up those comments for our newsletter.\n\nAs the United States of America approach the next presidential election, the age of the two presumed candidates for the highest office in the nation, current President Joe Biden and former President Donald J. Trump, has increasingly become a topic of public debate. Why is this and what can researchers in the field of adult development and aging contribute to this debate?\n\nWhy has the age of the two anticipated candidates become a focus in the public debate? The answer to this question becomes clear when one looks at the ages of previous presidents at inauguration. A historical review shows that the median age of all U.S. presidents at inauguration is 55 years. This is a considerably younger age than would be the case when the next president would be inaugurated. If Joe Biden were elected to a second term in November 2024, he would be 82 when sworn into office in January 2025. If Donald J. Trump were elected, he would be 78 years old on inauguration day. Both candidates were the two oldest presidents in U.S. history when they assumed office the first time: Biden at age 78 and Trump at age 70.\n\nAlthough age has never been a major topic in presidential elections before, in today\u2019s climate of societal division, partisanship, and social media frenzy it has become a topic\u2014often with an ageist undertone. Namely, with the unspoken implication that a certain age should perhaps automatically disqualify a candidate from running for the highest office in the country. Ironically, the presumed candidates are only 4 years apart, but very little consideration is given to this fact and whether being 4 years apart makes a significant difference.\n\nWhat can researchers in the field of adult development and aging contribute to this public debate? First, psychologists who study adult development and aging can remind the public that chronological age is in research studies often found to be a so-called empty variable. That is, across the adult lifespan, age is often not the most relevant variable to predict whether a person can perform a job in a competent way or what a person\u2019s level of cognitive functioning and overall competence look like. Other variables, such as level of education, physical health (e.g., absence of cardiovascular and cardiometabolic disease), occupational status, performance on cognitive tests, or mental health, tend to be more predictive of a person\u2019s overall functioning than age. Better predictive variables would also include whether an individual has had the opportunity to develop expertise in a certain area of functioning, such as professional achievement or accumulating a solid amount of world knowledge. For example, a competent president should be expected to have considerable expertise in the areas of government (e.g., how government agencies work), national leadership (e.g., how the federal government and state governments interconnect), and international relations (e.g., how the U.S. is connected to other nations). Furthermore, a competent president should be able to understand complex and multifaceted problems so that s/he can make quick and accurate decisions for the benefit of the American people and the rest of the world.\n\nSecond, although it is well-documented that the so-called \u201cfourth age\u201d (i.e., age 85 and older; Baltes & Smith, 2003) is associated with an increased vulnerability in terms of physical and mental health, aging researchers also need to remind the public that there are great interindividual differences among adults in that age range. For example, one person may show serious cognitive impairment due to dementia by the age of 70, whereas another person at age 85 is still quite cognitively sharp and may run their business successfully. One of these latter specimens, for example, is Warren Buffett, the well-known investor, co-founder, chairman, and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, who is currently 93 years old but is still functioning at a very high level. There is plenty of evidence from psychological aging research that refutes using a simple number as an equivalent for a person\u2019s competence and achievements. Such a determination should be made through a careful assessment of an individual\u2019s actual performance capacity, including a comprehensive assessment of the person\u2019s cognitive and neuropsychological functioning.\n\nThird, in the current public debate the question has been raised whether candidates who run for political office and are of a certain age should be subjected to mandatory cognitive testing. On the surface this may look like a legitimate suggestion to many. However, upon closer examination things do not look so straightforward and may not be so legitimate. Indeed, several reasons speak against such a call. First, who would determine what the recommended age would be for when such testing would become mandatory? Second, who would determine what tests should be administered, who would administer them, and how should the results from such tests be used? Regulations regarding the privacy of medical and psychological records (i.e., HIPAA-like rules) may supersede the public\u2019s interest and need to know. Such a requirement may also deter otherwise completely capable, motivated, and experienced individuals from running for an office in which they could possibly do a great deal of good for their constituents. Third, in this context it also needs to be emphasized that simple cognitive screening tests, such as the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) or the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) test, are not sufficient to determine a person\u2019s cognitive competence in a comprehensive way. These tests are screening tests that can distinguish individuals with mild cognitive impairment or early dementia from individuals who are seemingly cognitively intact. However, a battery of cognitive and neuropsychological tests, which involves multiple hours of testing, is required to determine a person\u2019s cognitive capacity in a comprehensive way. Taken together, these reasons suggest that a call for mandatory cognitive testing is rather unreasonable and does not solve the issue of whether a certain age should disqualify a candidate from running for a high political office.\n\nFinally, it is also important to point out that the current public debate about the presidential candidates is tinged with a good amount of ageism\u2014the prejudice against and discrimination of older adults based on negative age stereotypes (Levy, 2022). Although the U.S. society has made great progress in terms of fighting and calling out incidents of racism and sexism, ageism seems to be one of the last socially acceptable prejudices (Weir, 2023), including that it is quite acceptable to make fun of older adults and basically portray them with broad brush strokes as incompetent and obsolete. That such ageism is quite prevalent in everyday life was reported by Ober Allen and colleagues (2020) based on a national sample of adults aged 50-80. In this survey, 82% of the interviewed adults reported that they experienced one or more forms of ageism in their everyday lives, including that 65% of the adults reported exposure to ageist messages. This exposure is not without consequences as was shown in the same survey. For example, those older adults who reported experiencing three or more forms of everyday ageism had worse physical and mental health than those who reported fewer forms of everyday ageism (Ober Allen et al., 2020). Thus, exposure to ageist messages and attitudes undermines an older person\u2019s well-being and functioning and may be especially undermining to a person\u2019s confidence and behavior if it is broadcasted in the media. Here it is also important to note unambiguously that most of the stereotypes and misconceptions that are at the root of ageist messages and behaviors can be refuted based on decades of sound psychological research (Diehl et al., 2020; Levy, 2022).\n\nIn summary, how should the general public approach the age question in the current debate regarding the anticipated presidential candidates? First, people should be aware that age itself is nothing but a number and often does not tell us a great deal about a person\u2019s competencies. Research on adult development and aging has shown this time and again. Second, knowing this, voters should examine the actual and objective record of the candidates and should make their decision based on a thorough review and evaluation of those records. Third, people should be skeptical about and should resist simple solutions to the age question, such as the call for mandatory cognitive testing for individuals who run for a political office. Such calls may be well-intentioned and may appear reasonable and accurate in revealing objective criteria to determine a person\u2019s fitness for office, but they may have other unintended consequences, including that they may deter otherwise highly qualified individuals from serving for the common good.",

        "text": "Turkish local elections: Opposition stuns Erdogan with historic victory\nTurkish local elections: Opposition stuns Erdogan with historic victory\n\nREUTERS/Umit Bektas Opposition supporters celebrated in Istanbul and other cities as the scale of victory became clear\n\nTurkey's main opposition party has claimed big election victories in the main cities of Istanbul and Ankara.\n\nThe results are a significant blow for Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who had hoped to regain control of the cities less than a year after he claimed a third term as president.\n\nHe led the campaign to win in Istanbul, where he grew up and became mayor.\n\nBut Ekrem Imamoglu, who first won the city in 2019, scored a second victory for the secular opposition CHP.\n\nMr Erdogan had vowed a new era in Turkey's megacity of almost 16 million people, but the incumbent mayor of Istanbul secured more than 50% of the vote, defeating the president's AK Party candidate by more than 11 points and almost one million votes.\n\nThis was also the first time since Mr Erdogan came to power 21 years ago that his party was defeated across the country at the ballot box.\n\nIn the capital Ankara, opposition mayor Mansur Yavas was so far ahead of his rival on 60% that he declared victory when fewer than half the votes were in. Supporters blocked all the main roads in the city, waving flags and sounding their car horns.\n\nThe CHP - the Republican People's Party - won again in Izmir, Adana and the resort of Antalya. Significantly it also gained control of Turkey's fourth-biggest city Bursa and Balikesir in the north-west, as well as Adiyaman, which hit hard by last year's double earthquake in the south-east.\n\nPresident Erdogan, 70, acknowledged the election had not gone as he had hoped, but he told supporters in Ankara it would mark \"not an end for us but rather a turning point\".\n\nHe has always relied on the \"people's will\" for his authority and he told supporters he would respect the electorate now too.\n\nUnder Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey's presidency has amassed sweeping powers, replacing the prime minister. But in the cities, directly elected mayors still have considerable influence.\n\nDuring the election campaign, Mr Erdogan said this would be his last, because his presidential term ends in 2028.\n\nBut critics believed that victory would have encouraged him to revise the constitution so he could stand again. After such a dramatic defeat that is looking very unlikely.\n\nEmin Sansar/Anadolu via Getty Images President Erdogan promised supporters his party would learn its lessons from the defeat\n\nPolitical scientist Berk Esen said the opposition CHP had delivered the \"biggest election defeat of Erdogan's career\" and come up with its best results since 1977.\n\nThe outcome was a big success for the chairman of the CHP, Ozgur Ozel, who praised voters for deciding to change the face of Turkey in a historic vote: \"They want to open the door to a new political climate in our country.\"\n\nCrowds in Istanbul gathered outside the town hall in Sarachane, one of Istanbul's oldest districts.\n\nThey waved Turkish flags and banners showing Ekrem Imamoglu's picture alongside Turkey's founding father Kemal Ataturk, whose poster was draped down the walls of the local authority building.\n\n\"I can say that our citizens' trust and faith in us has been rewarded,\" said Mr Imamoglu.\n\nTOLGA BOZOGLU/EPA-EFE Ekrem Imamoglu won Istanbul for the opposition in 2019\n\nBoth he and Mansur Yavas are seen as potential candidates to run for the presidency in 2028.\n\n\"Everything will be fine,\" Imamoglu supporters chanted as they danced to drums and clarinets in Sarachane, one of Istanbul's oldest districts.\n\nIstanbul's incumbent mayor had first used the slogan when he won the city from Mr Erdogan's party five years ago. Some of the banners in Sarachane used his current slogan, \"Full speed ahead\".\n\n\"They're only local elections but the opposition's victory in big cities is a significant show of force against the ruling party,\" Imamoglu supporter Yesim Albayrak, 25, told the BBC.\n\nMehmet Bankaci, 27, told the BBC there was a need for change in Turkey: \"If Imamoglu or Mansur Yavas had been the CHP candidate in last year's presidential election, they definitely would have won.\"\n\nIstanbul hosts a fifth of Turkey's population of nearly 85 million people. Control the city and you control a significant portion of Turkey's economy including trade, tourism and finance.\n\nFive years ago, Mr Imamoglu overturned years of AK Party rule in Istanbul with the backing of other opposition parties. But that opposition unity fell apart in the wake of last year's presidential election defeat and the AK Party had high hopes of overturning his 2019 victory.\n\nAhead of Sunday's election, the vote had been seen as too close to call, with a strong challenge from AK Party candidate Murat Kurum.\n\nBut the ruling party has been unable to shake off an economic crisis that has seen inflation rates of 67% and interest rates at 50%.\n\nWhile broad swathes of the west, south and north of Turkey are now under the control of the opposition CHP, the pro-Kurdish Dem party has won control of much of the south-east.\n\nMr Erdogan's AK Party continues to dominate central Turkey and had more success in areas of the south-east devastated by the February 2023 double earthquake, including the cities of Kahramanmaras and Gaziantep, although it did lose control of Adiyaman.\n\nSpeaking from the balcony of his party headquarters in Ankara, he promised to use the four years before the next presidential election to \"renew ourselves and compensate for our mistakes\".\n\nHis supporters chanted back: \"Stand still, this nation is with you.\"",

        "text": "U.S. Trade Policy Is at a Crossroads\nFrom the end of the Second World War through the end of the Barack Obama administration, the meaning of U.S. leadership on trade was pretty clear: negotiating agreements to open markets in any country that was willing to do so. However, its definition is far from clear today. The administration of President Joe Biden has tried out approaches that put trade in the service of fighting climate change, empowering workers, discouraging monopolies, embracing U.S. allies, sanctioning Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, curbing Chinese influence, and bolstering U.S. manufacturing. But in the election year of 2024, that complex structure looks at risk of crashing from the weight of its own ambitions.\n\nU.S. trade policy was once fairly simple. Following the powerful insights of British political economist David Ricardo, countries that opened their markets to trade and investment by exporting what they produced best (and importing the rest) saw enormous\u2014and largely shared\u2014gains in wealth. The United States, with a huge consumer market and a slew of competitive multinational companies, considered itself a big winner from trade liberalization and encouraged agreements of every shape and size. As an added bonus, opening the U.S. market to imports helped to strengthen political alliances around the world. The job of American political leaders, therefore, was to keep negotiating trade agreements that provided ever more market opportunities for the United States and for other countries. It was a classic, and rare, win-win.\n\nOne version of U.S. leadership on trade calls for restoring that old model by launching new negotiations in Asia or Latin America that would further reduce tariffs or regulatory impediments to trade. Even if that were politically possible\u2014and with the Republican Party under Donald Trump abandoning its support for free trade it is almost certainly not\u2014the case for restoration is weak. With tariffs already at historic lows, the gains from further market-access negotiations are likely to be small. More importantly, restoration would not tackle any of the biggest contemporary challenges: accelerating the transition to green technologies, lifting stagnant wages, containing the risks of artificial intelligences, and maintaining power balances that discourage conflicts in Europe and Asia.\n\nFinding balance in Biden\u2019s broad trade agenda\n\nThe World This Week A weekly digest of the latest from CFR on the biggest foreign policy stories of the week, featuring briefs, opinions, and explainers.

Those efforts include U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai\u2019s worker-centered trade policy, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan\u2019s \u201csmall yards, high fences\u201d approach for controlling technology trade with China, and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen\u2019s friendshoring strategy for including allies in the clean energy supply chain. All represent serious efforts to build a trade policy for a more complex world.\n\nBut the Biden administration has yet to grapple with the contradictions among those different approaches. Take the recent $14.1 billion bid by Japan\u2019s Nippon Steel to purchase U.S. Steel, the Pittsburgh-based Industrial Age icon. On friendshoring grounds, Japan is a critical ally and blocking the acquisition would seem wholly unjustified. On clean energy grounds, steel companies are struggling to meet new EU requirements, which favor cleaner steel over products made with dirty carbon emissions; new investments from Nippon Steel could help to make the United States a global leader. But Biden has come out against the acquisition on \u201cworker-centered grounds,\u201d the United Steelworkers union opposes the deal, and Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH), who is in a tough reelection fight in a right-leaning state, says the deal would weaken trade enforcement.\n\nOr consider the likelihood of new tariffs on imports of solar panels from Southeast Asia. Both the Obama and Trump administrations put tariffs on panel imports from China, which are heavily subsidized by the Chinese government in violation of U.S. trade laws. Those tariffs shifted panel production to several Southeast Asian countries that are important to the United States, including Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. Some of that production is likely Chinese-made panels being shipped through the region, and the Commerce Department last year ruled that those products should face import tariffs, too.\n\nBut the Biden administration has suspended any collection of those tariffs until June as part of a two-year moratorium on new tariffs meant to keep down the costs of solar panels and encourage more Americans to install them on their homes. Solar panels from Southeast Asia (or China for that matter) pose no security threats, help the economies of U.S. allies, and encourage a quicker U.S. transition away from dirty energy. But the lower cost of imports also discourages American manufacturing, costing jobs in panel production (even as it increases jobs in installation). Senator Brown, along with Democratic senators from Georgia\u2014a critical electoral state\u2014are calling for the tariffs to be imposed. The president seems likely to comply.\n\nAll of these scenarios could be seen as the inevitable conflicts that emerge when trying to design new trade policies for a complex world. But one of the requirements of economic leadership is that countries should be seen as at least occasionally paying a price for their principles. In the free-trade era, the United States made politically unpopular decisions to lift import barriers in sectors such as textiles and apparel, and often complied with difficult rulings made by the now-neutered dispute-settlement panels of the World Trade Organization.\n\nThe biggest challenge for U.S. trade policy today is to acknowledge those trade-offs and find consistent approaches to resolving the contradictions. This could be too much to expect of the Biden administration in an election year, especially given the dangerous alternative. But until firmer ground can be found, U.S. claims for renewed leadership on trade will continue to ring hollow.",

        "text": "2024 Delegate Selection Process\nAhead of the 2024 Democratic National Convention, the Delaware Democratic Party will select a small delegation of local Democrats, party leaders, and elected officials to formally nominate the Democratic nominee for U.S. President.\n\n2024 the Democratic Party will formally nominate Joe Biden and Kamala Harris for re-election at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Chicago, Illinois. Democrats from all 50 states and the 7 territories will gather in the Windy City to complete the nomination process, conduct party business, and kick off the General Election season. For its role in this process, Delaware must send a small delegation of local Democrats, party leaders, and elected officials to Chicago for the 2024 Democratic National Convention. The process for selecting Delaware Delegation is outlined in the 2024 Delegate Selection Plan found at the bottom of this page.\n\nThank you to all of the Delaware Democrats who have participated in the Delegate Selection Process so far. As of March 19, the application period for this year's process has closed.\n\n2024 Delegate Selection Caucus, April 13\n\nDelaware\u2019s 2024 Delegate Selection Process will culminate in a Delegate Selection Caucus (DSC) at Bally's Dover Casino Resort on Saturday, April 13, 2024. At this State Caucus, Delaware will elect its Democratic National Convention Delegates. Those elected will attend the 2024 National Convention in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nCheck-in will open at 9:00 am. Upon checking in, Caucus Electors and DNC Delegate Candidates will receive their credentials. While only Caucus Electors and Delegate Candidates will have an official role in the Caucus, the event is open to all registered Democrats. Guests and spectators will also need to check in to gain access to the DSC. Guests are strongly encouraged to pre-register ahead of time to expedite their check-in process. To register as a guest click here.\n\nCaucus Electors\n\nThe voting body of the DSC is made of Caucus Electors. In February, each Rep. District convened to elect a slate of up to four local Democrats to serve on the district's behalf at the DSC. The Caucus Electors will vote on who becomes a National Convention Delegate.\n\nThe roster of caucus electors will be made available upon request to any registered Delaware Democrat. To request the roster please email dnc2024@deldems.org with your name and voting address (to confirm registration).\n\nNational Committee Member Elections\n\nThe first order of business will be to elect Delaware\u2019s two (2) Democratic National Committee members. These members serve as Delaware\u2019s representatives on the Democratic National Committee and attend biannual meetings at their own expense. The four-year term for the members elected at this year's caucus will begin immediately after the 2024 National Convention. The newly elected members will not be a part of the 2024 National Convention Delegation and will instead attend the 2028 National Convention. Delaware\u2019s current National Committee members, Sean Finnigan and Kerri Evelyn Harris, will attend this Summer\u2019s National Convention.\n\nNominations for National Committee Members will be taken from the floor. Any registered Delaware Democrat is eligible to serve as a National Committee Member. National Committee Member positions are gender balanced, meaning the two members may not be of the same gender.\n\nNational Convention Delegate Elections\n\nFollowing the election of National Committee Members, Caucus Electors will split off into Subdivision Groups. These groups will then elect their subdivision's National Convention Delegates. The subdivision delegates to the national convention are allocated among Delaware\u2019s four subdivisions (Kent County, New Castle County, Sussex County, and Wilmington City) based on the vote share of the 2020 Presidential and Gubernatorial candidates. Delegates are distributed as follows\n\n2 Kent Delegates\n\n6 New Castle Delegates\n\n2 Sussex Delegates\n\n2 Wilmington Delegates\n\nAfter each of the subdivisions have elected their delegates, the full caucus body will reconvene to elect the remaining At-Large(5), Alternate(2), and Party Leader(2) delegates. After the last delegate has been elected the caucus will vote to affirm the appointment of Convention Committee Members. The meeting will then adjourn.\n\n\n\nDelegate Selection Plan Overview\n\nAfter a thorough review and public comment period, 2024 Delaware's Delegate Selection plan was formally approved by the National Party's Rules and Bylaws Committee in October of 2023. The plan details the Delaware Democratic Party's commitment to a fair, accessible, and transparent process that ensures that Delaware's 2024 Democratic National Convention delegation reflects the party locally.\n\nDelaware's Delegation\n\nDelaware is slated to send 34 total delegates and two (2) alternates to the Democratic National Convention. In addition, Delaware will send three (3) convention pages and three (3) standing committee members to next summer's Democratic convention.\n\n12 Subdivision/District Level Delegates\n\n5 At-Large Delegates\n\n2 Pledged Party Leader & Elected Official Delegates\n\n15 Automatic Party Leader & Elected Official Delegates (to be finalized in March 2024)\n\n2 At-Large Alternates\n\nAll local registered Democrats are encouraged to participate in the process, which will begin fielding applications in early 2024. Through the Winter and Spring of 2024, the state and local parties will host a series of public caucuses and meetings to decide on Delaware\u2019s delegation. Rep. District level caucuses will take place in February to select electors to the State level caucus. On April 13, 2024, electors will gather in Dover for the 2024 Delegate Selection Caucus. Those selected as delegates will travel to Chicago, Illinois for the 2024 Democratic National Convention where the Party will formally make its nomination for President.\n\nBasic Procedure\n\nThroughout the Winter and Spring of 2024, local Democrats will have a chance to participate in Delaware's Delegate Selection Process. Those selected as delegates will participate in the 2024 Democratic National Convention in Chicago.\n\nBeginning January 3, National Convention Delegate Applications will be available online and at State Party Headquarters. Those wishing to become a DNC Delegate will need to submit their completed application form by March 19, 2024.\n\nIn February 2024 the local party will host a series of Representative District Caucuses. A caucus will be held for each of the 41 State Representative (House) Districts. At these District Caucuses, four(4) resident Democrats will be selected to serve as electors at the 2024 State Caucus. Serving as an elector is not a requirement to become a DNC Delegate.\n\nThe electors from each State House District will gather in Dover on Saturday, April 13 for the 2024 Delegate Selection Caucus where they will vote on Delaware's DNC Delegates.\n\nKey Delegate Selection Dates\n\nThere are several key dates in the Delegate Selection Process",

        "text": "Joe Lieberman\nAmerican politician (1942\u20132024)\n\nJoseph Isadore Lieberman ( ; February 24, 1942 \u2013 March 27, 2024) was an American politician and lawyer who served as a United States senator from Connecticut from 1989 to 2013. A former member of the Democratic Party, he was its nominee for vice president of the United States in the 2000 U.S. presidential election. During his final term in office, he was officially listed as an Independent Democrat and caucused with and chaired committees for the Democratic Party.\n\nLieberman was elected as a Democrat in 1970 to the Connecticut Senate, where he served three terms as majority leader. After an unsuccessful bid for the U.S. House of Representatives in 1980, he served as the Connecticut attorney general from 1983 to 1989. He narrowly defeated Republican Party incumbent Lowell Weicker in 1988 to win election to the U.S. Senate and was re-elected in 1994, 2000, and 2006. He was the Democratic Party nominee for vice president in the 2000 presidential election, running with presidential nominee and then Vice President Al Gore, and becoming the first Jewish candidate on a U.S. major party presidential ticket.[2][3]\n\nIn the 2000 presidential election, Gore and Lieberman won the popular vote by a margin of more than 500,000 votes but lost the deciding Electoral College to the Republican George W. Bush / Dick Cheney ticket 271\u2013266. He also unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination in the 2004 U.S. presidential election. During his Senate re-election bid in 2006, Lieberman lost the Democratic primary election but won re-election in the general election as a third party candidate under the Connecticut for Lieberman party label.\n\nLieberman was officially listed in Senate records for the 110th and 111th congresses as an Independent Democrat,[4] and sat as part of the Senate Democratic Caucus. After his speech at the 2008 Republican National Convention in which he endorsed John McCain for president, he no longer attended Democratic Caucus leadership strategy meetings or policy lunches.[5] The Senate Democratic Caucus voted to allow him to keep the chairmanship of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. Subsequently, he announced that he would continue to caucus with the Democrats.[6] Before the 2016 election, he endorsed Hillary Clinton for president and in 2020 endorsed Joe Biden for president.\n\nAs senator, Lieberman introduced and championed the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010 and legislation that led to the creation of the Department of Homeland Security. During debate on the Affordable Care Act (ACA), as the crucial 60th vote needed to pass the legislation, his opposition to the public health insurance option was critical to its removal from the resulting bill signed by President Barack Obama.[7]\n\nEarly life\n\nLieberman was born on February 24, 1942, in Stamford, Connecticut, the son of Henry, who ran a liquor store, and Marcia (n\u00e9e Manger) Lieberman.[8] His family is Jewish; his paternal grandparents emigrated from Congress Poland and his maternal grandparents were from Austria-Hungary.[9]\n\nIn 1963, Lieberman traveled to Mississippi to work in support of the civil rights movement.[10] He received a Bachelor of Arts in both political science and economics from Yale University in 1964,[11] and was the first member of his family to attend college.[12] At Yale, he was editor of the Yale Daily News and a member of the Elihu Club.[13] While at Yale Lieberman was introduced to conservative thinker William F. Buckley Jr., who was also editor of the Yale Daily News; Buckley and Lieberman maintained a social relationship.[14] His roommate was Richard Sugarman, who later went on to become a Professor of Philosophy and Religion at the University of Vermont and advisor to 2016 presidential candidate Bernie Sanders.[15] Lieberman later attended Yale Law School, receiving his Bachelor of Laws in 1967.[16] After graduation from law school, Lieberman worked as a lawyer for the New Haven-based law firm Wiggin & Dana LLP.[17]\n\nLieberman received an educational deferment from the Vietnam War draft when he was an undergraduate and law student from 1960 to 1967. Upon graduating from law school at age 25, Lieberman qualified for a family deferment because he was already married and had a child.[18][19]\n\nEarly political career\n\nLieberman with President Ronald Reagan in 1984\n\nLieberman was elected to the Connecticut Senate in 1970, where he served for 10 years, including the last six as Majority Leader.[20] He suffered his first defeat in Connecticut elections in the Reagan landslide year of 1980, losing the race for the third district congressional seat to Republican Lawrence Joseph DeNardis,[21] a state senator from suburban Hamden[22] with whom he had worked closely on bipartisan legislative efforts.[23] In 1981 he wrote an admiring biography of long-time Connecticut and national Democratic leader John Moran Bailey, reviewing also in the book the previous 50 years of Connecticut political history.[24]\n\nFrom 1983 to 1989, Lieberman served as Connecticut Attorney General.[25] He argued one case before the United States Supreme Court, Estate of Thornton v. Caldor, Inc., a free exercise case involving Connecticut's repeal of its blue laws.[14] In the 1986 general election, Lieberman won more votes than any other Democrat on the statewide ticket, including Governor William O'Neill.[26] As Attorney General, Lieberman emphasized consumer protection and environmental enforcement.[27]\n\nU.S. Senate\n\nTenure\n\nLieberman was first elected to the United States Senate as a Democrat in the 1988 election, defeating liberal Republican Lowell Weicker by a margin of 10,000 votes.[28] He scored the nation's biggest political upset that year,[29] after being backed by a coalition of Democrats and unaffiliated voters with support from conservative Republicans, most notably including National Review founder and Firing Line host William F. Buckley Jr. and his brother, former New York Senator James L. Buckley,[30] who were disappointed in three-term Republican incumbent Weicker's liberal voting record and personal style. During the campaign, he received support from Connecticut's Cuban American community, which was unhappy with Weicker. Thereafter, Lieberman remained firmly anti-Castro.[31]\n\nShortly after his first election to the Senate, Lieberman was approached by incoming Majority Leader George Mitchell who advised him, \"Pick out two or three areas that you're really interested in and learn them so that your colleagues know what you're talking about ... You're going to have more influence even as a freshman than you think because you know there's hundreds of issues and inevitably we rely on each other.\"[32] Recalling the conversation, Lieberman said \"that was true when I first came in, although you could see partisanship beginning to eat away at that. But at the end of my 24 years, it was really so partisan that it was hard to make the combinations to get to 60 votes to break a filibuster to get things done.\"[32]\n\nLieberman's initiatives against violence in video games are considered the chief impetus behind the establishment of an industry-wide video game rating system during the early 1990s.[33]\n\nLieberman (second from the left) and Senate colleagues with President Bill Clinton and his national security team on Air Force One to Bosnia in 1997\n\nIn 1994, Lieberman made history by winning by the largest landslide ever in a Connecticut Senate race, drawing 67 percent of the vote and beating his opponent by more than 350,000 votes.[20] Lieberman then served as chair of the Democratic Leadership Council from 1995 to 2001.[34] In 1998, Lieberman was the first prominent Democrat to publicly challenge Clinton for the judgment exercised in his affair with Monica Lewinsky;[35] however, he voted against removing Clinton from office by impeachment.[36] Of his criticism of Bill Clinton, Lieberman said in 2014:\n\nIt was a very hard thing for me to do because I liked him but I really felt what he did was awful and that unless I felt myself if I didn't say something, I'd be a hypocrite. I also felt that if somebody who was supportive of him didn't say something, it would not be good. And so it got a lot of attention. I got a call from Erskine Bowles who was Chief of Staff about three or four days later saying that he was going to express an opinion which wasn't universally held at the White House \u2013 he thought I helped the president by bursting the boil, that was the metaphor he used. The following Sunday morning, I'm at home and the phone rings, it's the White House. And it's now about a week and a couple of days since I made the speech. The president says, it was the president, \"I just want you to know that there's nothing you said in that speech that I don't agree with. And I want you to know that I'm working on it.\" And we talked for about forty-five minutes. It was amazing.[32]\n\nIn 2000, Lieberman was elected to a third Senate term, defeating the Republican candidate, Philip Giordano.[37]\n\nVice presidential campaign\n\nLieberman's 2000 Senate campaign was concurrent with that year's presidential election. In August 2000, Vice President Al Gore announced that he had selected Lieberman as his vice presidential running mate. Lieberman became the first practicing Jew to run for the nation's second-highest office.[38] Lieberman was selected from a group of potential running mates that reportedly included Senators John Kerry and John Edwards, the team that would form the Democratic presidential ticket four years later.[39]\n\nLieberman had a reputation of being a more ideologically conservative Democrat than Gore.[40] Because of Lieberman's criticism of Clinton's personal behavior, some viewed Gore's choice of Lieberman as a way to distance himself from the scandals of the Clinton White House.[41] The Gore\u2013Lieberman ticket was defeated in a hard-fought election that was contested for weeks after the vote. On December 12, a U.S. Supreme Court ruling brought the race to an official end, confirming the decision in the favor of the Bush-Cheney ticket.[20]\n\n2006 Senate election\n\nPrimary\n\nDemocratic Primary Results Candidate Votes [ 42 ] Percentage Ned Lamont 146,587 52% Joe Lieberman 136,468 48%\n\nLieberman sought the Democratic Party's renomination for U.S. Senate from Connecticut in 2006 but lost to the comparatively more liberal[43] Ned Lamont, a Greenwich businessman[44] and antiwar candidate.[45] Lamont received 33 percent of the delegates' votes at the Connecticut Democratic Convention in May, forcing an August primary.[46]\n\nIn July, Lieberman announced that he would file papers to appear on the November ballot should he lose the primary, saying, \"I'm a loyal Democrat, but I have loyalties that are greater than those to my party, and that's my loyalty to my state and my country.\"[47] He said he would continue to sit as a Democrat in the Senate even if he was defeated in the primary and elected on an unaffiliated line, and expressed concern for a potentially low turnout.[48] On July 10, the Lieberman campaign officially filed paperwork allowing him to collect signatures for the newly formed Connecticut for Lieberman party ballot line.[49]\n\nOn August 8, 2006, Lieberman conceded the Democratic primary election to Ned Lamont, saying, \"For the sake of our state, our country and my party, I cannot and will not let that result stand,\"[50] and announced he would run in the 2006 November election as an independent candidate on the Connecticut for Lieberman ticket, against both Lamont and the Republican candidate, Alan Schlesinger.[51]\n\nGeneral election\n\nLieberman during his re-election campaign on an independent ticket\n\nPolls after the primary showed Lieberman leading by varying margins.[52] Alan Schlesinger barely registered support,[53] and his campaign had run into problems based on alleged gambling debts. According to columnist Steve Kornacki, Lieberman was therefore \"able to run in the general election as the de facto Republican candidate \u2013 every major Republican office-holder in the state endorsed him \u2013 and to supplement that GOP base with strong support from independents.\"[54]\n\nOn August 9, 2006, Hillary Clinton, the junior U.S. senator from New York, affirmed her pledge to support the primary winner, saying \"voters of Connecticut have made their decision and I think that decision should be respected\",[55] and Howard Dean called for Lieberman to quit the race, saying he was being \"disrespectful of Democrats and disrespectful of the Democratic Party\".[56] On August 10, in his first campaign appearance since losing the Democratic primary, referencing the 2006 transatlantic aircraft plot, Lieberman criticized Lamont, saying: \"If we just pick up like Ned Lamont wants us to do, get out [of Iraq] by a date certain, it will be taken as a tremendous victory by the same people who wanted to blow up these planes in this plot hatched in England. It will strengthen them and they will strike again.\"[57] Lamont noted Lieberman's position was similar to George W. Bush and Dick Cheney's position. Lamont said, \"That comment sounds an awful lot like Vice President Cheney's comment on Wednesday. Both of them believe our invasion of Iraq has a lot to do with 9/11. That's a false premise.\"[57] Lieberman's communications director replied that Lamont was politicizing national security by \"portraying [Lieberman] as a soul mate of President Bush on Iraq\".[57]\n\nAs a Democrat, Lieberman earned an inordinate amount of support from some prominent conservatives in American politics. On August 17, 2006, the National Republican Senatorial Committee stated that they would favor a Lieberman victory in the November election over Democratic nominee Ned Lamont; however, the NRSC stated that they were not going so far as to actually support Lieberman.[58] Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani praised Lieberman at a South Carolina campaign stop on August 18, saying he was \"a really exceptional senator\".[59] Five Democratic senators maintained their support for Lieberman, and Lieberman also received the strong support of former senator and Democratic stalwart Bob Kerrey, who offered to stump for him.[60] Democratic minority leader Harry Reid, while endorsing Lamont, promised Lieberman that he would retain his committee positions and seniority if he prevailed in the general election. On August 28, Lieberman campaigned at the same motorcycle rally as Republican Congressman Christopher Shays.[61] Shays told a crowd of motorcycle enthusiasts, \"We have a national treasure in Joe Lieberman.\" Mel Sembler, a former Republican National Committee finance chairman, helped organize a reception that raised a \"couple hundred thousand dollars\" for Lieberman, who was personally in attendance. Sembler is a prominent Republican who chaired I. Lewis 'Scooter' Libby's legal defense fund.[62] New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg held a fundraiser for Lieberman at his home in November, co-hosted by former mayor Ed Koch and former Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato.[63] Koch called Lieberman \"one of the greatest Senators we've ever had in the Senate.\"[64]\n\nDespite still considering himself a Democrat, Lieberman was endorsed by numerous Republicans who actively spoke out in favor of his candidacy. Lieberman was also the focus of websites such as ConservativesforLieberman06.com.[65] On November 7, Lieberman won re-election with 50% of the vote. Ned Lamont garnered 40% of ballots cast and Alan Schlesinger won 10%.[66] Lieberman received support from 33% of Democrats, 54% of independents and 70% of Republicans.[67]\n\nCreation of Department of Homeland Security (DHS)\n\nWhen control of the Senate switched from Republicans to Democrats in June 2001, Lieberman became Chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, with oversight responsibilities for a broad range of government activities. He was also a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee and chair of its Subcommittee Clean Air, Wetlands and Private Property; the Armed Services Committee, where he chaired the Airland Subcommittee and sat on the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities; and the Small Business Committee. When Republicans gained control of the Senate in January 2003, Lieberman resumed his role as ranking minority member of the committees he had once chaired.[68]\n\nLieberman was an early supporter of the creation of the Department of Homeland Security as the chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee,[69][70] proposing organizing FEMA, the U.S. Customs Service, the U.S. Border Patrol, the U.S. Coast Guard, and other agencies under the new department.[71] This proposal was eventually implemented in the Homeland Security Act of 2002.[72][73]\n\nIn 2006, Senators Lieberman and Collins drafted legislation to reshape the Federal Emergency Management Agency into an agency that would more effectively prepare for and respond to catastrophes, including natural disasters and terrorist attacks. The legislation elevated FEMA to special status within the Department of Homeland Security, much like the Coast Guard and designated FEMA's head to be the president's point person during an emergency. The bill also called for the reunification of FEMA's preparedness and response functions, giving it responsibility for all phases of emergency management. In addition, the measure strengthened FEMA's regional offices, creating dedicated interagency \"strike teams\" to provide the initial federal response to a disaster in the region. The legislation passed Congress in September 2006.[74]\n\nAs the 2007 hurricane season approached, Lieberman held an oversight hearing on implementation of the FEMA reforms on May 22, 2007. He urged FEMA to implement the reforms at a quicker pace.[75]\n\nLieberman was involved in congressional oversight of the response to the H1N1 influenza (swine flu) pandemic and held four hearings on the subject in 2009, including one in Connecticut. At the hearings, he pressed the United States Department of Health and Human Services to distribute vaccines and antiviral medications at a quicker pace and to streamline the process.[76]\n\nIn the 110th Congress, Lieberman was Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which is responsible for assuring the Federal Government's efficiency and effectiveness. He was also a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee; Senate Armed Services Committee, where he was Chairman of the Subcommittee on Air Land Forces and sat on the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities; and the Small Business Committee.[73]\n\nFundraising\n\nFrom 1989 onwards, Lieberman received more than $31.4 million in campaign donations from specific industries and sectors. His largest donors represented the securities and investment ($3.7 million), legal ($3.6 million), real estate ($3.1 million), and health professional ($1.1 million) industries.[77]\n\nCommittee assignments\n\nCaucus memberships\n\nPresidential election involvement\n\n2000\n\nSupporters for the Gore\u2013Lieberman ticket\n\nIn August 2000, Lieberman was selected as the nominee for Vice President of the United States by Al Gore, the Democratic Party nominee for president.[89] Among the last round candidates were U.S. senators Bob Graham, John Kerry and John Edwards. The nomination committee was headed by Warren Christopher.[90] Lieberman was the first Jewish candidate on a major political party ticket.[89] Of the vetting process, Lieberman related a conversation in which Christopher told him the background checks would be \"like a medical procedure without an anesthesia.\"[32]\n\nThe Gore/Lieberman ticket won a plurality of the popular vote, with over half a million more votes than the Republican ticket of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, but they were defeated in the Electoral College by a vote of 271 to 266 after an intense legal battle concerning the outcome in disputed counties (see Bush v. Gore).[91] The US Supreme Court ruled that the Florida Supreme Court's ordered recount was unconstitutional and said that it defers to what it believes is the Florida Supreme Court's judgment that December 12 is the deadline for all recounts\u2014thus preventing a new recount from being ordered.[92]\n\nHe decided to run for re-election to maintain his Senate seat, as vice-presidential candidates Joe Biden and Paul Ryan did for their senatorial and congressional seats respectively in 2008 and 2012.[93] Lieberman would subsequently win his re-election and continued serving in the Senate until his retirement in 2012.[94]\n\n2004\n\nSupporters for Joe Lieberman\n\nOn January 13, 2003, Lieberman announced his intention to seek the Democratic nomination as a candidate in the 2004 presidential election.[95] Lieberman campaigned on his experience in government as well as his centrist and hawkish positions.[96] Indeed, he initially led in polls of primaries, but due to his political positions he failed to win a support of liberal Democratic voters, who dominated the primaries.[97]\n\nPrior to his defeat in New Hampshire, Lieberman declared that his campaign was picking up \"Joementum\";[98] however, he failed to provide such momentum during the New Hampshire primary debates, held at Saint Anselm College days before the primary.[99] On February 3, 2004, Lieberman withdrew his candidacy after failing to win any of the five primaries or two caucuses held that day. He acknowledged to the Hartford Courant that his support for the war in Iraq was a large part of his undoing with voters.[100]\n\nLieberman's former running candidate Al Gore did not support Lieberman's presidential run, and in December 2003 endorsed Howard Dean's candidacy, saying \"This is about all of us and all of us need to get behind the strongest candidate [Dean].\"[101] Finally, Lieberman withdrew from the race without winning a single contest. In total popular vote he placed 7th behind the eventual nominee, Massachusetts senator John Kerry; the eventual vice presidential nominee, North Carolina Senator John Edwards; former Governor of Vermont Howard Dean; Ohio Representative Dennis Kucinich; retired General Wesley Clark; and Reverend Al Sharpton.[102]\n\n2008\n\nOn December 17, 2007, Lieberman endorsed Republican Senator John McCain for president in 2008,[103] going against his party and going back on his stance in July 2006 when he stated \"I want Democrats to be back in the majority in Washington and elect a Democratic president in 2008.\"[104] Lieberman cited his agreement with McCain's stance on the War on Terrorism as the primary reason for the endorsement.[105]\n\nOn June 5, 2008, Lieberman launched \"Citizens for McCain\", hosted on the McCain campaign website, to recruit Democratic support for John McCain's candidacy. He emphasized the group's outreach to supporters of Hillary Clinton, who was at that time broadly expected to lose the Democratic presidential nomination to Barack Obama.[106] Citizens for McCain was prominently featured in McCain team efforts to attract disgruntled Hillary Clinton supporters such as Debra Bartoshevich.[107][108]\n\nLieberman spoke at the 2008 Republican National Convention on behalf of McCain and his running mate, Alaska Governor Sarah Palin.[109] Lieberman was alongside McCain and Senator Lindsey Graham during a visit to French president Nicolas Sarkozy on March 21, 2008.[110] Lieberman was mentioned as a possible vice presidential nominee on a McCain ticket.[111][112] ABC News reported that Lieberman was McCain's first choice for vice president until several days before the selection, when McCain had decided that picking Lieberman would alienate the conservative base of the Republican Party.[113][114] Lieberman had been mentioned as a possible Secretary of State under a McCain administration.[115]\n\nMany Democrats wanted Lieberman to be stripped of his chairmanship of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs due to his support for John McCain which went against the party's wishes.[116] Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell reached out to Lieberman, asking him to caucus with the Republicans.[117] Ultimately, the Senate Democratic Caucus voted 42 to 13 to allow Lieberman to keep chairmanship (although he did lose his membership for the Environment and Public Works Committee). Subsequently, Lieberman announced that he would continue to caucus with the Democrats.[6] Lieberman credited President-elect Barack Obama for helping him keep his chairmanship. Obama had privately urged Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid not to remove Lieberman from his position. Reid stated that Lieberman's criticism of Obama during the election angered him, but that \"if you look at the problems we face as a nation, is this a time we walk out of here saying, 'Boy did we get even'?\" Senator Tom Carper of Delaware also credited the Democrats' decision on Lieberman to Obama's support, stating that \"If Barack can move on, so can we.\"[118][119]\n\nSome members of the Democratic caucus were reportedly angry at the decision not to punish Lieberman more severely. The independent Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont stated that he voted to punish Lieberman \"because while millions of people worked hard for Obama, Lieberman actively worked for four more years of President Bush's policies.\"[119] Lieberman's embrace of certain conservative policies and in particular his endorsement of John McCain have been cited as factors for his high approval rating among Republicans in Connecticut with 66% of Republicans approving of him along with 52% of independents also approving of his job performance; this is also cited for his mediocre approval rating among Democrats: 44% approving and 46% disapproving.[120] In September 2018, Lieberman gave a eulogy at the funeral of John McCain, in which he stated that he had turned down a request to serve as McCain's 2008 running mate.[121]\n\n2012, 2016, and 2020\n\nIn April 2012, Lieberman announced that he would not make any public endorsements in the 2012 presidential election between President Obama and former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney.[122] On August 10, 2016, Lieberman endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.[123] On September 13, 2020, Lieberman endorsed Democratic candidate Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election.[124]\n\nCriticism\n\nSenator Lieberman speaking at a 2005 event to keep Alaska wild to save polar bears, among other arctic wildlife\n\nIraq War support\n\nLieberman was a supporter of the Iraq War and urged action against Iran. In July 2008, Lieberman spoke at the annual conference of Christians United for Israel (CUFI). In July 2009, he accepted CUFI's \"Defender of Israel Award\" from John Hagee.[125] Pastor Hagee, CUFI's founder and leader, made a number of controversial remarks, including a statement that the Catholic Church is \"the great whore\" and a suggestion that God allowed the Holocaust to happen to bring the Jews to Israel.[126]\n\nIslamic extremism controversy\n\nIn April 2010, Lieberman blasted President Obama for stripping terms like \"Islamic extremism\" from a key national security document, calling the move dishonest, wrong-headed, and disrespectful to the majority of Muslims who are not terrorists.[127]\n\nFilibuster\n\nWhile favoring the filibuster and threatening to use it in 2009 to eliminate a public health option as part of the healthcare proposal, Lieberman once strongly opposed the filibuster. In 1995, he joined with Senator Tom Harkin to co-sponsor an amendment to kill the filibuster. Lieberman told the Hartford Courant: \"The filibuster hurts the credibility of the entire Senate and impedes progress.\"[128]\n\nSupport for surveillance\n\nLieberman favored greater use of surveillance cameras by the federal government and referred to attempts by Congress to investigate illegal wiretapping as \"partisan gridlock\". On June 19, 2010, Lieberman introduced a bill called \"Protecting Cyberspace as a National Asset Act of 2010\",[129] which he co-wrote with Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) and Senator Thomas Carper (D-DE). If signed into law, this controversial bill, which the American media dubbed the \"Internet kill switch\", would grant the President emergency powers over the Internet; however, all three co-authors of the bill issued a statement claiming that instead, the bill \"[narrowed] existing broad Presidential authority to take over telecommunications networks\".[130] American computer security specialist and author Bruce Schneier objected to the \"kill switch\" proposal on the basis that it rests on several faulty assumptions and that it's \"too coarse a hammer\". However, Schneier also wrote: \"Defending his proposal, Sen. Lieberman pointed out that China has this capability. It's debatable whether or not it actually does, but it's actively pursuing the capability because the country cares less about its citizens. Here in the U.S., it is both wrong and dangerous to give the president the power and ability to commit Internet suicide and terrorize Americans in this way.\"[131]\n\nSuppressing whistleblowing\n\nLieberman was a major opponent of the whistleblowing website WikiLeaks. His staff \"made inquiries\" of Amazon.com and other internet companies such as PayPal, Visa, and MasterCard which resulted in them suspending service to WikiLeaks. Journalist Glenn Greenwald called Lieberman's actions \"one of the most pernicious acts by a U.S. Senator in quite some time,\" and accused Lieberman of \"emulat[ing] Chinese dictators\" by \"abusing his position as Homeland Security Chairman to thuggishly dictate to private companies which websites they should and should not host \u2013 and, more important, what you can and cannot read on the Internet.\"[132] Lieberman also suggested that \"The New York Times and other news organisations publishing the U.S. embassy cables being released by WikiLeaks could be investigated for breaking US espionage laws.\"[133]\n\nAlong with Senators John Ensign and Scott Brown, Lieberman \"introduced a bill to amend the Espionage Act in order to facilitate the prosecution of folks like Wikileaks.\"[134] Critics have noted that \"[l]eaking [classified] information in the first place is already a crime, so the measure is aimed squarely at publishers,\" and that \"Lieberman's proposed solution to WikiLeaks could have implications for journalists reporting on some of the more unsavory practices of the intelligence community.\"[135] Legal analyst Benjamin Wittes called the proposed legislation \"the worst of both worlds\", saying:\n\nIt leaves intact the current World War I\u2013era Espionage Act provision, 18 U.S.C. 793(e), a law [with] many problems ... and then takes a currently well-drawn law and expands its scope to the point that it covers a lot more than the most reckless of media excesses. A lot of good journalism would be a crime under this provision; after all, knowingly and willfully publishing material \"concerning the human intelligence activities of the United States or any foreign government\" is no small part of what a good newspaper does.[134]\n\nAs a result of these statements and actions, Lieberman was perceived as an opponent of Internet free speech and became the target of Anonymous attacks under Operation Payback.[136][137]\n\nPolitical positions\n\nLieberman was a strong advocate for the war in Iraq.[138] He was also a strong supporter of the U.S.-Israel relationship.[139] On domestic issues, he supported free trade economics[140] while also reliably voting for pro-trade union legislation.[141] As part of the Gang of 14, he opposed filibustering Republican judicial appointments.[142] Lieberman was a supporter of abortion rights[143] and of the rights of gays and lesbians to be protected with hate crime legislation, and to serve openly in the military.[144] Lieberman was one of the Senate's leading opponents of violence in video games and on television. Lieberman described himself as being \"genuinely an Independent\", saying \"I agree more often than not with Democrats on domestic policy. I agree more often than not with Republicans on foreign and defense policy.\"[145] Lieberman was known for his leadership in the successful effort to repeal the Don't ask, don't tell policy regarding sexual orientation in the U.S. Armed Forces.[146][147][148]\n\nDuring debate on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Lieberman opposed the public option. As the crucial 60th vote needed to pass the legislation, his opposition to the public option was critical for its removal from the resulting bill.[7] Lieberman was an integral part in attempting to stop WikiLeaks from publishing further material using U.S.-based corporations in the United States diplomatic cables leak of 2010.[149] That same year, he joined Republican Senator Scott Brown and bipartisan House members Jason Altmire and Charlie Dent in introducing the Terrorist Expatriation Act, which proposed stripping citizenship rights from Americans who took arms against the United States or provided material support to enemy combatants. The bill received mixed reviews and was heavily criticized by some senior Democrats.[150][151]\n\nIn June 2015, Lieberman was a signatory to a public letter written by a bipartisan group of 19 U.S. diplomats, experts, and others, on the then-pending negotiations for an agreement between Iran and world powers over Iran's nuclear program.[152][153] That letter outlined concerns about several provisions in the then-unfinished agreement and called for a number of improvements to strengthen the prospective agreement and win the letter-writers' support for it.[152] The final agreement, concluded in July 2015, shows the influence of the letter.[152]\n\nIn May 2021, Lieberman expressed support for Israel in the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict and praised \"the quiet and effective diplomacy of President Biden, who was not drawn in by the left of the Democratic Party to essentially take a stand against Israel.\"[154]\n\nPost-Senate career\n\nA survey in October 2010 showed that Lieberman had an approval rating of 31% and that just 24% of Connecticut voters felt he deserved re-election.[155] Lieberman announced on January 19, 2011, that he would retire from the Senate at the end of his fourth term.[156][157] Lieberman gave his farewell address on December 12, 2012.[158] He was succeeded by Democratic representative Chris Murphy.[159]\n\nFollowing his retirement from the Senate, Lieberman moved to Riverdale, Bronx, and registered to vote in New York as a Democrat.[1] He became senior counsel of the white collar criminal defense and investigations practice at Kasowitz, Benson, Torres & Friedman, a law firm in New York City whose notable clients include Donald Trump.[160] In March 2013, it was announced that Lieberman would be joining the conservative American Enterprise Institute think tank as co-chairman of their American Internationalism Project, alongside former Republican Senator Jon Kyl.[161] In February 2014, Lieberman was named as Counselor at the National Bureau of Asian Research.[162] Additionally, he served as the Lieberman Chair of Public Policy and Public Service at Yeshiva University, where he taught an undergraduate course in political science.[11]\n\nIn 2015, Lieberman served as co-chair of the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense, a commission that recommended changes to U.S. policy regarding biodefense.[163] In order to address biological threats facing the nation, the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense created a 33 step initiative for the U.S. Government to implement. Lieberman headed the organization with former Governor Tom Ridge, and the Study Panel assembled in Washington, D.C., for four meetings concerning current biodefense programs. The Study Panel concluded that the federal government had inadequate defense mechanisms in case of a biological event. The Study Panel's final report, The National Blueprint for Biodefense, proposes a string of solutions and recommendations for the U.S. Government to take, including items such as giving the vice president authority over biodefense responsibilities and merging the entire biodefense budget. These solutions represent the Panel's call to action in order to increase awareness and activity for pandemic related issues.[164] In 2022, the group released a report recommending a $10 billion, 10-year program to prevent the next pandemic, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.[165]\n\nIn August 2015, Lieberman became chairman of the advocacy group United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI).[166] In March 2016, Lieberman was hired by the Schaghticoke Tribal Nation to assist the group in challenging Connecticut laws giving exemptions to only the top two state gaming tribes to build casinos.[167][168] That same year, Lieberman joined the Muslim-Jewish Advisory Council, an organization founded to address anti-Muslim and anti-Jewish bigotry in the United States.[169] Lieberman was also on the advisory board of the Counter Extremism Project (CEP).[170]\n\nIn early 2017, Lieberman introduced President elect Donald Trump's nominee as Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos to the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pension committee. One report on Lieberman's involvement was critical of him for failing to disclose in his testimony the extensive legal work his Kasowitz, Benson, Torres & Friedman law firm had done for Donald Trump since at least as long ago as 2001. The work included bankrupt casino restructuring and, during the 2016 campaign, threatening The New York Times over publication of a few 1995 Trump tax documents.[171]\n\nOn May 17, 2017, Lieberman was interviewed by President Donald Trump for the position of FBI Director, to replace recently fired James Comey.[172] The interview took place against the background of the appointment of Special Counsel Robert Mueller to investigate issues connected to Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections.[173] Speaking to reporters while meeting with Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, Trump said he was \"very close\" to choosing a new FBI director to replace James Comey, and when asked if Lieberman was his top pick, Trump said yes.[174] The President also stated that the odds were \"better than 50-50\" that his pick for FBI director would be made before he departed for his first trip abroad on Friday;[175] however, no announcement was made publicly on Friday.[175] On May 25, 2017, Lieberman officially withdrew his name from consideration.[176]\n\nOn July 17, 2018, Lieberman published an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal imploring people to vote for Joe Crowley, who was defeated in the Democratic primary by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Crowley would run on the Working Families Party line, without support of a major party, similar to how Lieberman defeated Lamont in 2006. Lieberman continued to remain critical of Ocasio-Cortez, stating that \"With all respect, I certainly hope she's not the future, and I don't believe she is.\"[177] In January 2019 Lieberman officially registered as a lobbyist working for ZTE but stated that his work for the corporation will be limited to assess national security concerns and will not include actual lobbying.[178] In July 2022, Lieberman became one of the founding members of a group of U.S. business and policy leaders which shares the goal of engaging constructively with China and improving U.S.-China relations.[179]\n\nA founding co-chairman of No Labels since its inception in 2010, Lieberman had helped to lead the group\u2019s efforts to promote bipartisanship in Congress. [180] [181] In 2023, Lieberman wrote two opinion pieces in The Wall Street Journal asking people to consider supporting a No Labels unity presidential ticket in the 2024 presidential election. [182] No Labels did surveys of thousands of voters to understand what they care about, concluding that most Americans are dissatisfied with both major political parties and that most of them supported having additional choices for president beyond the two major party nominees. [182] No Labels secured ballot access in 24 states before ending its effort to find a unity ticket in April 2024 after the group could not find a candidate willing to lead the ticket. [183]\n\nPersonal life and death\n\nLieberman met his first wife, Betty Haas, at the congressional office of Senator Abraham Ribicoff (D-CT), where they worked as summer student interns. They married in 1965 while Joe Lieberman was in law school. They had two children \u2013 Matt and Rebecca. Betty, who is also Jewish, later worked as a psychiatric social worker. In 1981, the couple divorced. When asked about the divorce in an interview with New York Magazine, Lieberman said, \"one of the differences we had was in levels of religious observance\", adding, \"I'm convinced if that was the only difference, we wouldn't have gotten divorced.\"[184]\n\nIn 1982, he met his second wife, Hadassah Freilich Tucker, while he was running for Attorney General of Connecticut. Hadassah Tucker's parents were Holocaust survivors.[14] According to Washington Jewish Week, Lieberman called her for a date because he thought it would be interesting to go out with someone named Hadassah. (Hadassah is the Hebrew name of Esther in the biblical Book of Esther, and subsequently also the name of the Women's Zionist Organization of America).[185] From March 2005, Hadassah Lieberman worked for Hill & Knowlton, a lobbying firm based in New York City, as a senior counselor in its health and pharmaceuticals practice. She held senior positions at the Hospital of Saint Raphael in New Haven, the American Committee for Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem, Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials-International (APCO), Pfizer, National Research Council, Hoffmann-La Roche, and Lehman Brothers.[186]\n\nJoe and Hadassah Lieberman had a daughter, Hana. In 2018 she made Aliyah to Israel with her family.[187] Lieberman also had a stepson from Hadassah's previous marriage with Gordon Tucker, Ethan Tucker. Lieberman's son, Matt, graduated from Yale University and from Yale Law School.[188] He is the former head of the school of Greenfield Hebrew Academy in Atlanta.[189] He was an unsuccessful candidate in the 2020 United States Senate special election in Georgia.[190] Rebecca, Lieberman's daughter, graduated from Barnard College in 1991, and from the University of Pennsylvania Law School in 1997.[191] Lieberman's stepson Ethan graduated from Harvard College in 1997 and received his rabbinic ordination from the Chief Rabbinate of Israel.[192][193]\n\nLieberman with Marty Markowitz at the 2011 Brooklyn Book Festival to discuss the role spirituality played in his life\n\nLieberman described himself as an \"observant\" Jew.[2] His first wife, Betty Haas, is a Reform Jew. After the death of his grandmother, a deeply religious immigrant, in 1967, he found a renewed interest in religious observance. His second wife, Hadassah, is also an observant Modern Orthodox Jew. \"Hadassah calls herself my right wing\", said Lieberman.[184] In Lieberman's 1988 upset of Republican Party incumbent Senator Lowell Weicker, Lieberman's religious observance was mostly viewed in terms of refusal to campaign on the Jewish Sabbath. This changed when Al Gore chose Lieberman as the running mate; a Lieberman press officer who spoke on condition of anonymity said: \"He refers to himself as observant, as opposed to Orthodox, because he doesn't follow the strict Orthodox code and doesn't want to offend the Orthodox, and his wife feels the same way.\"[194]\n\nThe Liebermans kept a kosher home and observed the Sabbath.[194] In one notable instance, then-Senator Lieberman walked to the Capitol after Sabbath services to block a Republican filibuster.[195] Lieberman said that there was currently \"a constitutional place for faith in our public life\", and that the Constitution does not provide for \"freedom from religion\".[196] He attended Kesher Israel Congregation in Georgetown, Washington, D.C., and Beth Hamedrosh Hagodol \u2013 B'nai Israel, The Westville Synagogue, New Haven, Connecticut.[197] He also attended Congregation Agudath Sholom in his hometown of Stamford. Lieberman was an admirer of the last Lubavitcher Rebbe, Menachem Mendel Schneerson. He said of Schneerson, \"I was impressed by this man, by his obvious spirituality, by his soaring intellect, by the extent to which he was involved in the world.\"[198] He said he had studied the commentaries of Rabbis Joseph Ber Soloveitchik and Abraham Isaac Kook.[14]\n\nLieberman was the first person of Jewish background or faith to run on a major party presidential ticket.[199] Lieberman said that he liked to sing and was a fan of Frank Sinatra, whose song \"My Way\" was the theme of his first Senate campaign.[14] He chanted the classic section of Proverbs \"Eshet Hayil\" to his wife every Friday night.[14]\n\nOn March 27, 2024, Lieberman died at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, aged 82, from injuries that he sustained in a fall at his home in the Bronx.[200][201] He received tributes from many, including from Presidents Joe Biden, Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, Vice Presidents Kamala Harris, Mike Pence and Al Gore, Senators Tom Cotton and Lindsey Graham, and Israeli politicians Isaac Herzog and Benjamin Netanyahu.[202][203][204][205][non-primary source needed][206][207][non-primary source needed] Lieberman is entombed in the cemetery at Congregation Agudath Sholom.[208]\n\nElectoral history\n\nAwards\n\nSenator Lieberman visits Navy base in Groton, Connecticut.\n\nIn 2008, Lieberman received the U.S. Senator John Heinz Award for Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards.[209]\n\nIn 2011, the National Defense University foundation honored Senators Lieberman and John McCain the American Patriot Award for their lifetimes of public service. They were recognized for their outstanding record of contributions to America's national security, armed forces and veterans throughout their impressive careers in government.[210]\n\nIn 2011, Lieberman was awarded St. George Order of Victory by President of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili for his support of Georgia following their 2008 war with Russia.[211]\n\nPublished works\n\nLieberman authored at least ten books, including The Power Broker (1966), a biography of the late Democratic Party chairman John M. Bailey;[212][213] The Scorpion and the Tarantula (1970), a study of early efforts to control nuclear proliferation;[214][215] The Legacy (1981), a history of Connecticut politics from 1930 to 1980;[216][217] Child Support in America: Practical Advice on Negotiating and Collecting a Fair Settlement (1986), a guidebook on methods to increase the collection of child support from delinquent fathers;[218][219] In Praise of Public Life (2000);[220][221] An Amazing Adventure: Joe and Hadassah's Personal Notes on the 2000 Campaign (2003), reflecting on his 2000 vice presidential run;[222][223] The Gift of Rest: Rediscovering the Beauty of the Sabbath (2011), written with David Klinghoffer,[224][225] With Liberty and Justice: The Fifty-Day Journey from Egypt to Sinai (2018), on a trip with Rabbi Ari D. Kahn,[226][227] and The Centrist Solution: How We Made Government Work and Can Make It Work Again (2021).[228][229][230] In his book Ticking Time Bomb: Counter-Terrorism Lessons from the U.S. Government's Failure to Prevent the Fort Hood Attack (2011), he described Australian Muslim preacher Feiz Mohammad, American-Yemeni imam Anwar al-Awlaki, Muslim cleric Abdullah el-Faisal, and Pakistani-American Samir Khan as \"virtual spiritual sanctioners\" who use the internet to offer religious justification for Islamist terrorism.[231]\n\nSee also\n\nReferences\n\nOfficial site",

        "text": "Senegal: From Constitutional Crisis to Democratic Restoration\nAfter a series of setbacks and doubts as to whether Senegal\u2019s presidential election would actually take place before the end of President Macky Sall\u2019s term on April 2, the election was held on March 24 without any major incidents and in a transparent manner.1 A few hours after the polls closed, partial results were already pointing to a first-round winner: Bassirou Diomaye Faye, the candidate of the most outspoken opposition to the incumbent government, and second in command of the African Patriots of Senegal for Work, Ethics and Fraternity party (PASTEF). Released from prison just ten days before the election after eleven months in pretrial detention, the forty-four-year-old former tax inspector will be the youngest and most unexpected president in the history of independent Senegal. He will be the continent\u2019s youngest serving president when he takes office in April.2\n\nBefore his presidential candidacy, Faye was little known to the Senegalese public, working in the shadow of party leader Ousmane Sonko. Sonko, also a former tax official, emerged in recent years as the most outspoken political opponent of Sall\u2019s government. Sonko gained popularity, especially among young people, for his highly critical discourse on the traditional political class and for his promises of a radical break from how the country has been governed for decades.\n\nOn the evening of April 2, Sall will step down after twelve years at the helm of the country. He will hand over power to a young president from a political party that his government officially dissolved in July 2023, whose \u201cradical\u201d style he found unsettling. To many, Sall\u2019s final months in office have been a political failure, tarnishing a solid record of infrastructure development and diplomatic activity on the African and international stage. In his efforts to neutralize his main political opponents, Sall has instead facilitated their uncontested victory. However, by permitting the electoral administration to play its role without further political interference, Sall allowed Senegal to reach a peaceful and democratic conclusion to three years of political tension, violence, and uncertainty.\n\nThreats to Senegal\u2019s Democratic Credibility\n\nOn February 3, 2024, Sall launched the country into a political and constitutional crisis when he announced his decision to postpone the presidential election planned for February 25. Sall\u2019s announcement preceded a bill in the Senegalese Parliament that moved to officially change the election date to December 15, 2024, effectively extending Sall\u2019s term in office. Senegalese citizens responded with mass demonstrations, and the state cut mobile internet access and deployed large police forces to its major cities, resulting in the loss of four lives.3\n\nOn February 15, Senegal\u2019s Constitutional Council\u2014the country\u2019s highest constitutional court, whose members are appointed by the president\u2014ruled that Sall\u2019s decree to move the election date and Parliament\u2019s subsequent bill were unconstitutional. The council urged Sall to set the earliest possible date for the election and confirmed that Sall\u2019s five-year presidential term would end on April 2. In place of the scheduled February 25 election, the government held a two-day \u201cNational Dialogue\u201d on February 26 and 27 that brought together a wide range of representatives of political parties, civil society organizations, and religious groups. However, opposition candidates voiced concerns that Sall\u2019s National Dialogue was about \u201cslowing down the election,\u201d and demanded that Sall set a presidential election date as soon as possible.4 Following a Constitutional Council ruling that rejected the postponement of the election beyond the end of Sall\u2019s electoral mandate, Sall announced on March 6 that the election would take place on March 24.\n\nThomas Carothers and Benjamin Press, in a paper on global democratic backsliding, argue that for a country to be considered a \u201cdemocratic backslider,\u201d it must have \u201cachieved a significant level of democracy\u201d and then \u201cexperienced significant erosion of democratic institutions,\u201d often at the hand of \u201cpurposeful elite actors.\u201d5 Senegal has long been heralded as one of the few stable democracies in West Africa, a region that has seen a trend of democratic backsliding since 2020, with coups d\u2019\u00e9tat in Burkina Faso, Guinea, Mali, and Niger. However, threats to the country\u2019s democratic credibility had been simmering for quite some time, and until the March 24 election seemed to temporarily place Senegal in the category of a \u201cdemocratic backslider.\u201d\n\nSenegal\u2019s current constitution grants presidents a maximum of two consecutive terms of office. However, presidential term limits have been a consistent source of turmoil for Senegal. When Sall\u2019s predecessor, Abdoulaye Wade, was elected to office in 2000, Senegal did not yet have term limits. After Wade changed the constitution to ensure a two-term limit, he positioned himself for a third term in 2012, arguing that constitutionally mandated term limits were not retroactive. Amid widespread protests, Sall emerged as the leading opposition figure, promising constitutional reform. In his first term, which ran from 2012 to 2019, Sall reduced the presidential term from seven to five years. However, two years into his second term, Sall seemed to be positioning himself for a third by refusing to publicly state his political intentions beyond his mandate.\n\nMore broadly, Sall\u2019s two terms in office have marked trends in the restriction of political participation in Senegal, as shown in figure 1. Sall\u2019s reelection in 2019 came after the Constitutional Council ruled that two of Sall\u2019s major opposition candidates were ineligible to run for president because of their convictions in separate corruption cases. Those corruption cases were widely seen as \u201can effort [by the Sall administration] to neutralize\u201d Sall\u2019s most powerful political opponents.6\n\nIn addition, Sall\u2019s administration moved to limit freedom of the press and freedom of speech. In 2021, Sall signed into law a press code that allowed for a two-year prison term for \u201cdefamation\u201d and up to three years for publishing \u201cfake news\u201d that could \u201cdiscredit public institutions\u201d or \u201cprejudice public decency.\u201d The Senegalese government moved to ban numerous opposition rallies and protests and heavily strengthened its paramilitary force, the National Gendarmerie, with waves of recruits and equipment to respond to protesters.\n\nThe state has made the draconian move of shutting down internet and social media access on mobile phones several times. In March 2021, the Senegalese state suspended two television stations and restricted access to social media applications and phone data services.7 In June and July 2023, the Senegalese government again restricted access to internet services and social media, citing the \u201cdissemination of hateful and subversive messages.\u201d8 Most recently, on February 13, 2024, the state shut off mobile internet access following Sall\u2019s announcement that the election date would be moved.9\n\nOne of the key players in Senegal\u2019s political landscape over the past five years is Ousmane Sonko, who rose to fame for denouncing corruption and criticizing Sall\u2019s administration while working as a government tax inspector. He emerged as a popular opposition leader with PASTEF during the 2019 presidential election. Although Sall was reelected, Sonko continued to rally youth in enormous numbers with his promises to fight government corruption. In 2021, Sonko was accused of \u201crape and death threats\u201d by an employee of a Dakar beauty salon, inflaming his supporters, who took to the streets to protest what they perceived as an attempt by the Sall administration to undercut a rising opposition movement.10 Sonko did not attend his trial and was sentenced in absentia to two years in prison for \u201ccorrupting youth\u201d on June 1, 2023, but acquitted of charges of rape and death threats.11\n\nFollowing this sentence, and after months of tension, Sonko was arrested in late July 2023 for \u201ccalling for insurrection, criminal conspiracy in connection with a terrorist undertaking and undermining state security\u201d and imprisoned.12 PASTEF was dissolved by the government on July 31 with an official statement by Senegal\u2019s interior minister accusing the party of having encouraged \u201cinsurrectional movements [with] serious consequences,\u201d including \u201closs of life\u201d and \u201clooting of public and private property.\u201d13 In the end, it was the Supreme Court\u2019s confirmation on January 4, 2024, of Sonko\u2019s suspended six-month prison sentence for defamation of a minister that led to his removal from the electoral roll and his exclusion from the presidential election.\n\nBreakdown of Political Norms\n\nIn addition to threats to Senegal\u2019s democratic stability, the past years have seen a breakdown of political norms and an increase in violence in the political arena. In the view of Sall\u2019s presidential camp, Sonko\u2014along with PASTEF\u2014represents a \u201cthreat\u201d to Senegal, particularly because of his alleged proximity to Islamist circles and his populist views. Sonko, for his part, is not one to shy away from inflammatory language. He has called for France to stop \u201csuck[ing] the blood of its ex\u00ad-colonies,\u201d supported the end of the French-inherited currency (CFA franc) and more generally campaigned for the end of economic and political influence from France and other external actors he believes to be detrimental to Senegal\u2019s national interests.14 At a January 2023 rally of his supporters, Sonko invoked the Wolof phrase gatsa-gatsa, or \u201ceye for an eye, tooth for a tooth,\u201d urging the crowd to \u201cfight\u201d against Sall \u201cwhatever it costs\u201d: \u201ceither [Sall] kills us or we kill him.\u201d15 In response to Sonko\u2019s June 2023 sentencing, PASTEF urged Senegalese citizens to \u201cmassively descend on the streets.\u201d16\n\nDemonstrations by Sonko\u2019s supporters have led to unprecedented levels of violence and destruction, shocking in a country where political tensions rarely escalate to this level. Protests in both 2021 and 2023 saw security forces fire tear gas and live and rubber bullets against protesters. They also set storefronts and government-owned buses on fire, blocked roads, built barricades, and threw stones at police forces.17 In March 2021, after Sonko was arrested and charged with \u201cdisturbing public order,\u201d massive protests led to the use of live bullets by police forces, leaving at least fourteen dead and hundreds injured.18 In June 2023, protests following Sonko\u2019s sentencing led to sixteen deaths and 500 arrests, with various witnesses reporting armed civilians attacking protesters alongside security forces, as well as the use of live bullets.19\n\nFollowing February\u2019s protests against Sall\u2019s election postponement attempt, Human Rights Watch called for an investigation into abuses by security forces toward Senegalese citizens, including the use of live and rubber bullets and tear gas at close range.20 Amnesty International similarly called for the Senegalese government to investigate the \u201cescalating repression and brutality\u201d of Senegalese police forces against protesters and members of the press.21\n\nSall\u2019s Political Calculations\n\nMost observers of the political scene in Senegal are convinced that Sall\u2019s move to postpone the election was not due to technical unpreparedness or exceptional circumstances but was rather a strategic ploy to organize a later election in a more favorable political context and with a potentially changed list of candidates.22 If Sall had successfully delayed the election, he would not only have extended his presidential term but allowed his party to better position its preferred candidate for victory.23 Political scientist Moussa Diaw described the election postponement as a \u201cpolitical maneuver\u201d born of a \u201cfake [governmental] crisis.\u201d24\n\nFor the 2024 election, Senegalese citizens had a choice between nineteen candidates, compared to five in the 2019 presidential election. The list included some of the country\u2019s leading political figures, including former prime minister Amadou Ba, the candidate chosen by Sall\u2019s coalition; former prime minister and runner-up in the 2019 presidential election Idrissa Seck; former Dakar mayor Khalifa Sall; and PASTEF\u2019s Faye. Faye was kept in pretrial detention beginning in April 2023, after he was accused of \u201cacts likely to compromise public peace,\u201d contempt of court, and defamation, until his release from prison in March 2024.25 Following PASTEF\u2019s dissolution and Sonko\u2019s removal from the electoral roll, Sonko officially endorsed Faye as his replacement in the presidential election.26\n\nSall\u2019s decision to choose Ba as his preferred candidate displeased many members of his presidential camp. Just days before Sall\u2019s announcement that he would move the election date, lawmakers from Sall\u2019s own ruling party accused two Constitutional Council judges of corruption, claiming that Ba had bribed them to remove one of his key opponents, Karim Wade, from the candidates list. Ba was not considered a popular figure, including within his own party, many of whom believed he had only a slim chance of winning. In addition, his candidacy emerged in an unfavorable political context for the ruling camp. The hardening of power over the past three years, marked by the systematic banning of public demonstrations, the arrest of numerous journalists and activists critical of the government, and the prosecution of his main political opponent, Sonko, made Sall increasingly unpopular.27\n\nIt is possible that Sall had clear insight into voter trends in the run-up to the election. One hypothesis is that Sall aimed to gain time to avoid the risk of seeing his camp lose the election, forcing him to hand over the presidency to opponents from the newly dissolved PASTEF.28 If Sall had been able to decide the timing and conditions of the election, he could have expected to significantly improve the chances of his chosen successor\u2019s victory. When a president leaves office, he or she is likely to want to hand over power to someone from his or her own political camp or groom a successor. If an outgoing president fears that his political adversaries will settle the score with legal proceedings, the desire to choose a trusted successor may be even stronger.\n\nThe reasons behind Sall\u2019s decision remain difficult to understand. In July 2023, after weeks of violent protests, he announced in a speech that he would not be a candidate in the February 2024 presidential election. Like his predecessor, Wade, he stressed that his candidacy would not have violated the constitution. However, a third term was not in line with his personal commitments. Most observers felt that Sall made this decision only after facing pressure from the opposition, civil society organizations, and Senegal\u2019s major external partners, including the United States and France.29\n\nSall\u2019s rationale has undermined his continental leadership and potential future as a statesman and former president who once presided over a democratic transition. He previously served as chairman of the Assembly of the African Union and was one of the most prominent and successful voices to advocate for an African Union seat in the G20. In a controversial move in November 2023, French President Emmanuel Macron appointed Sall as special envoy and chairman of the follow-up committee to the Paris Pact for People and the Planet. Some talked about the possibility of Sall taking on an international post as prestigious as that of the Secretary General of the United Nations. These prospects may have receded considerably after recent events, which have done serious damage to Sall\u2019s international reputation.30\n\nUnable to take part in the elections, unsure of the victory of his candidate or even of Ba\u2019s absolute loyalty after the elections, and unable to rule out a PASTEF presidential victory, it would appear that Sall used the final tool available to him by announcing an amnesty law during his National Dialogue. This amnesty law would guarantee immunity for all perpetrators of violence during political demonstrations between 2021 and 2024.31 On March 6, it was passed by the Senegalese Parliament. Importantly for Sall, the law would protect not only protesters but also members of the security forces and those responsible at the highest levels of Senegal\u2019s security apparatus and political circles. This maneuver allowed for the release of Sall\u2019s political opponents, including Sonko and Faye, while offering Sall and those close to him guarantees of security for the period following his departure from power. After using the stick, the president\u2019s camp seems to have opted for the carrot to limit the risk of a catastrophic end to Sall\u2019s final term.\n\nSenegal on the International Stage\n\nSince its independence, Senegal has maintained strong relationships with the United States, France, and other Western powers. The United States was very clear in its condemnation of the attempt to postpone the presidential election. In a telephone call on February 13, U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken spoke to Sall and urged him \u201cto restore Senegal\u2019s electoral calendar and presidential transition timetable in accordance with Senegal\u2019s constitution.\u201d32 \u00adOn March 27, in a White House statement, President Joe Biden also congratulated Faye on his election and sent \u201cwarm wishes\u201d to Senegalese citizens, who demonstrated that \u201cthe right to vote\u2014and have that vote counted\u2014remains democracy\u2019s threshold liberty.\u201d33\n\nAt the same time, in recent years, Senegal has moved to deepen its relationships with China and Russia. Senegal has a strong trade relationship with China and has worked over the past decade to strengthen the diplomatic relationship between the two countries. In June 2023, Sall, along with other African leaders, traveled to Ukraine and Russia, where in conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin, he urged the peaceful resolution of Russia\u2019s conflict with Ukraine.34 Just a month later, Sall joined the Russia-Africa Summit to engage in discussion on developing bilateral relations and broader Russian-African cooperation.\n\nSenegal has also expressed interest in joining the BRICS bloc of emerging economies, which positions itself as a champion of a more multilateral global order.35 BRICS has called for the reform of various Western-led organizations including the United Nations and the World Bank.36 In August 2023, BRICS admitted five new members: Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. With this expansion, the group now contains some of the West\u2019s strongest rivals. With a deepening divergence in global order between Western and non-Western powers, Senegal\u2019s future approach to diplomacy could have significant political and economic implications.\n\nIn June 2023, Senegal followed in the steps of South Africa, Indonesia, and Vietnam to sign a $2.7 billion Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) with Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the European Union. Senegal\u2019s JETP aims to increase the country\u2019s renewable energy capacity to 40 percent of its electricity generation.37 Yet Senegal\u2019s green energy transition will very likely take a backseat to oil and gas. More than 40 trillion cubic feet of natural gas was discovered during Sall\u2019s first term in office, positioning Senegal for enormous potential economic growth.38 Sall, for his part, championed the use of fossil fuels to support Senegal\u2019s industrialization and development, stating that natural gas would help the country transition away from oil. However, Senegal will need to strike a delicate balance between its domestic priorities and those of the international climate community. The prospect of significant financial gains from this sector vastly increased the stakes of the competition for political power and the overall significance of this year\u2019s presidential election.\n\nSall\u2019s time in office saw the implementation of ambitious infrastructure projects, including roads, railways, and urban transports. The country\u2019s GDP grew 4.1 percent in 2023 with predicted growth at 8.8 percent and 10.2 percent for 2024 and 2025 respectively.39 However, the country has seen limited economic diversification, structural change, and job creation for young people. Despite a growing workforce, youth unemployment is at 20 percent and the informal economy dominates.40 Inflation-linked high cost of living, unemployment, poverty, and lack of social services have led to general discontent and sowed the seeds of political unrest.\n\nPeriods of political unrest in Senegal have had direct effects on the country\u2019s economic status, both domestically and abroad. The protests of June 2023 led not only to the destruction of tens of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of infrastructure and public transportation but a shutdown of normal economic activity.41 The Senegalese government has estimated that even a single day of protests can slow the country\u2019s economic output by up to $33 million, with the heaviest burden felt by those in the informal sector.42 Beyond the country\u2019s borders, a \u201cpositive perception\u201d of Senegal is crucial to ensure continued foreign investment, as any changes to the country\u2019s risk assessment would cause serious financial consequences.43\n\nWhat\u2019s Next for Senegal Under President Faye?\n\nFollowing the passing of Sall\u2019s amnesty law, on March 15, Sonko and Faye were released from prison.44 With the backing of more than a dozen of the nineteen presidential candidates on the electoral roll and the support of important political figures (including Aminata Tour\u00e9, Sall\u2019s former close ally and prime minister), Faye was in an unusually good position despite having only nine days to campaign before the election.45 Faye\u2019s campaign slogan\u2014\u201cDiomaye mooy Sonko,\u201d meaning \u201cDiomaye is Sonko\u201d\u2014pledged his alliance to his fellow opposition figure; a vote for Faye was also a vote for Sonko.46 On March 24, more than 5 million of the 7.3 million Senegalese citizens registered to vote took to the polls to choose their preferred candidate.47 After Senegalese local media announced that Faye had won more than 50 percent of the votes, Ba officially conceded defeat.48 According to the official provisional results announced on March 27, Faye won 54.28 percent of the vote in the election, compared with 35.79 percent for Ba.49\n\nThis election was a victory for the citizens who mobilized and organized to demand that the election be held before the end of Sall\u2019s presidential term and who undoubtedly influenced the decision of the Constitutional Council, which went against the wishes of Sall and his political allies. It was a victory for those who defend democracy and the rule of law over the interests of those in power. In a West African context, where military rulers have been installed by coups d\u2019\u00e9tat and elected civilian rulers have tried to cling to power by manipulating constitutions, a transparent election in Senegal that resulted in an uncontested victory for the opposition is uplifting to the entire region.\n\nThe arrival of Faye and PASTEF to power is obviously no guarantee that the promises of changes to political practices and the management of public resources, or of addressing the pressing economic and social needs of young people, will be kept. The platform presented by PASTEF is ambitious, emphasizing the party\u2019s desire for Senegal to make more sovereign economic decisions and its refusal to accept the dictates of international institutions.50 However, the next administration will have to ensure that the Senegalese government honors its previous commitments, properly manages the country\u2019s foreign debt (which has increased significantly during the Sall years), and maintains good relations with international partners who have interests in Senegal\u2019s burgeoning oil and gas resources.\n\nSenegal\u2019s currency was one of the most debated issues during the election season and will continue to be so following Faye\u2019s victory. PASTEF\u2019s manifesto calls for Senegal to leave the CFA franc, which is pegged to the euro under an agreement with France, in favor of a national Senegalese currency.51 However, PASTEF leaders are aware of the contradiction that could exist between their pan-Africanist ideals and the hard realities of the fiscal and monetary policy as well as regional implications of leaving the CFA franc. Senegal is the largest economy after C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire in the subgroup of West African countries that share the CFA franc and a major diplomatic player within the wider bloc of the fifteen ECOWAS countries, three of which\u2014the military coup\u2013led Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger\u2014announced their withdrawal from the bloc in February 2024. In mid-March, Faye\u2019s election campaign said it would be necessary to try a region-wide implementation of a single currency at the level of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) before opting for a nationwide change to Senegal\u2019s currency.52\n\nThe new Senegalese president\u2019s positions on the complex political and security issues in the Sahel, the management of military transitions in the region, and the development of relations between Senegal and France will also be closely scrutinized.53 In his first speech as president-elect, Faye sought to reassure his country\u2019s external partners, declaring that Senegal \u201cwill remain a friendly country and a safe and reliable ally for any partner who engages with us in virtuous, respectful and mutually productive cooperation.\u201d54 On March 25, Macron congratulated Faye on his election and said he looked forward to working together.55\n\nThis surprising political change in Senegal has raised immense hopes. The immediate impact on the country\u2019s international image is undeniably positive. With Faye and a new generation of political leaders taking office, a new chapter in the country\u2019s political history will begin, bringing real opportunities for positive change, but also its share of uncertainties. The continued commitment of a large section of Senegalese society to more virtuous governance, stronger democratic institutions, and effective, realistic public policies will be crucial if the political breakthrough sought by the electorate is to translate into real improvements in people\u2019s lives.\n\nNotes\n\n1 Ruth Maclean, \u201cYoung Opposition Candidate Set to Become Senegal\u2019s

        "text": "What role should age play in a presidential election?\nOn February 19, 2024, Colorado State University's Center for Healthy Aging hosted an event on age limits for politicians, at which Division 20 past-president Manfred Diehl was one of the four panelists. Current Division 20 president Grace Caskie invited Diehl to summarize the thoughts and points he made at this event to share more broadly with Division 20 members. We greatly appreciate his willingness to write up those comments for our newsletter.\n\nAs the United States of America approach the next presidential election, the age of the two presumed candidates for the highest office in the nation, current President Joe Biden and former President Donald J. Trump, has increasingly become a topic of public debate. Why is this and what can researchers in the field of adult development and aging contribute to this debate?\n\nWhy has the age of the two anticipated candidates become a focus in the public debate? The answer to this question becomes clear when one looks at the ages of previous presidents at inauguration. A historical review shows that the median age of all U.S. presidents at inauguration is 55 years. This is a considerably younger age than would be the case when the next president would be inaugurated. If Joe Biden were elected to a second term in November 2024, he would be 82 when sworn into office in January 2025. If Donald J. Trump were elected, he would be 78 years old on inauguration day. Both candidates were the two oldest presidents in U.S. history when they assumed office the first time: Biden at age 78 and Trump at age 70.\n\nAlthough age has never been a major topic in presidential elections before, in today\u2019s climate of societal division, partisanship, and social media frenzy it has become a topic\u2014often with an ageist undertone. Namely, with the unspoken implication that a certain age should perhaps automatically disqualify a candidate from running for the highest office in the country. Ironically, the presumed candidates are only 4 years apart, but very little consideration is given to this fact and whether being 4 years apart makes a significant difference.\n\nWhat can researchers in the field of adult development and aging contribute to this public debate? First, psychologists who study adult development and aging can remind the public that chronological age is in research studies often found to be a so-called empty variable. That is, across the adult lifespan, age is often not the most relevant variable to predict whether a person can perform a job in a competent way or what a person\u2019s level of cognitive functioning and overall competence look like. Other variables, such as level of education, physical health (e.g., absence of cardiovascular and cardiometabolic disease), occupational status, performance on cognitive tests, or mental health, tend to be more predictive of a person\u2019s overall functioning than age. Better predictive variables would also include whether an individual has had the opportunity to develop expertise in a certain area of functioning, such as professional achievement or accumulating a solid amount of world knowledge. For example, a competent president should be expected to have considerable expertise in the areas of government (e.g., how government agencies work), national leadership (e.g., how the federal government and state governments interconnect), and international relations (e.g., how the U.S. is connected to other nations). Furthermore, a competent president should be able to understand complex and multifaceted problems so that s/he can make quick and accurate decisions for the benefit of the American people and the rest of the world.\n\nSecond, although it is well-documented that the so-called \u201cfourth age\u201d (i.e., age 85 and older; Baltes & Smith, 2003) is associated with an increased vulnerability in terms of physical and mental health, aging researchers also need to remind the public that there are great interindividual differences among adults in that age range. For example, one person may show serious cognitive impairment due to dementia by the age of 70, whereas another person at age 85 is still quite cognitively sharp and may run their business successfully. One of these latter specimens, for example, is Warren Buffett, the well-known investor, co-founder, chairman, and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, who is currently 93 years old but is still functioning at a very high level. There is plenty of evidence from psychological aging research that refutes using a simple number as an equivalent for a person\u2019s competence and achievements. Such a determination should be made through a careful assessment of an individual\u2019s actual performance capacity, including a comprehensive assessment of the person\u2019s cognitive and neuropsychological functioning.\n\nThird, in the current public debate the question has been raised whether candidates who run for political office and are of a certain age should be subjected to mandatory cognitive testing. On the surface this may look like a legitimate suggestion to many. However, upon closer examination things do not look so straightforward and may not be so legitimate. Indeed, several reasons speak against such a call. First, who would determine what the recommended age would be for when such testing would become mandatory? Second, who would determine what tests should be administered, who would administer them, and how should the results from such tests be used? Regulations regarding the privacy of medical and psychological records (i.e., HIPAA-like rules) may supersede the public\u2019s interest and need to know. Such a requirement may also deter otherwise completely capable, motivated, and experienced individuals from running for an office in which they could possibly do a great deal of good for their constituents. Third, in this context it also needs to be emphasized that simple cognitive screening tests, such as the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) or the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) test, are not sufficient to determine a person\u2019s cognitive competence in a comprehensive way. These tests are screening tests that can distinguish individuals with mild cognitive impairment or early dementia from individuals who are seemingly cognitively intact. However, a battery of cognitive and neuropsychological tests, which involves multiple hours of testing, is required to determine a person\u2019s cognitive capacity in a comprehensive way. Taken together, these reasons suggest that a call for mandatory cognitive testing is rather unreasonable and does not solve the issue of whether a certain age should disqualify a candidate from running for a high political office.\n\nFinally, it is also important to point out that the current public debate about the presidential candidates is tinged with a good amount of ageism\u2014the prejudice against and discrimination of older adults based on negative age stereotypes (Levy, 2022). Although the U.S. society has made great progress in terms of fighting and calling out incidents of racism and sexism, ageism seems to be one of the last socially acceptable prejudices (Weir, 2023), including that it is quite acceptable to make fun of older adults and basically portray them with broad brush strokes as incompetent and obsolete. That such ageism is quite prevalent in everyday life was reported by Ober Allen and colleagues (2020) based on a national sample of adults aged 50-80. In this survey, 82% of the interviewed adults reported that they experienced one or more forms of ageism in their everyday lives, including that 65% of the adults reported exposure to ageist messages. This exposure is not without consequences as was shown in the same survey. For example, those older adults who reported experiencing three or more forms of everyday ageism had worse physical and mental health than those who reported fewer forms of everyday ageism (Ober Allen et al., 2020). Thus, exposure to ageist messages and attitudes undermines an older person\u2019s well-being and functioning and may be especially undermining to a person\u2019s confidence and behavior if it is broadcasted in the media. Here it is also important to note unambiguously that most of the stereotypes and misconceptions that are at the root of ageist messages and behaviors can be refuted based on decades of sound psychological research (Diehl et al., 2020; Levy, 2022).\n\nIn summary, how should the general public approach the age question in the current debate regarding the anticipated presidential candidates? First, people should be aware that age itself is nothing but a number and often does not tell us a great deal about a person\u2019s competencies. Research on adult development and aging has shown this time and again. Second, knowing this, voters should examine the actual and objective record of the candidates and should make their decision based on a thorough review and evaluation of those records. Third, people should be skeptical about and should resist simple solutions to the age question, such as the call for mandatory cognitive testing for individuals who run for a political office. Such calls may be well-intentioned and may appear reasonable and accurate in revealing objective criteria to determine a person\u2019s fitness for office, but they may have other unintended consequences, including that they may deter otherwise highly qualified individuals from serving for the common good.",

        "text": "Every Vote Counts. But Who\u2019s Counting?\nAfter the immortal earworm \u201cGroove Is in the Heart,\u201d perhaps the most enduring song by the psychedelic party band Deee-Lite, is a 30-second PSA released in 1992 titled \u201cVote, Baby, Vote.\u201d\n\nThe political and popular cultural landscapes have shifted considerably since the 1990s. Back then, the idea of enthusiastically participating in the electoral process and accepting the results, win or lose \u2014 \u201cAre you registered, baby?\u201d Deee-Lite\u2019s Lady Miss Kier sang between go-go kicks \u2014 was wholeheartedly encouraged across party lines, even by those not watching MTV.\n\nJingles aside, voting in the U.S. has always been a serious business. It\u2019s sobering to remember that countless people have devoted their lives, and sometimes literally given them, simply to earn the right to vote in the United States. And yet, according to Pew Research Center, only about 66% of the voting-eligible population cast their votes in the 2020 presidential election, one of the most consequential in the nation\u2019s history. It\u2019s hardly a surprise that public trust in the federal government hit near-record lows in 2023.\n\nToday, as Americans find themselves, thanks to technology, more interconnected than ever, a glimpse into the funhouse mirror of social media reveals a country increasingly politically polarized, fragmented and heated, with no cooling in sight. The contrast is especially harsh as the 2024 presidential election ramps up, with so much at stake \u2014 locally, nationally and globally.\n\n\u201cWhat happens in the next two, three, four years is going to determine what the next four or five decades are going to look like,\u201d President Joe Biden remarked at a campaign stop in November. \u201cMore change is going to occur in the next 10 years than occurred in the last 50 years.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a reason that lands so ominously. Voting rights are under unprecedented attack across the country, as politics gets nastier and no tactic to gain advantage seems to be off limits. Luckily, though, there is an armada of people fighting to retain and protect voting rights in this country, among them a team from UCLA on the front lines of this highly charged, ever-changing battle. They\u2019re all seeking to preserve the idea of what was once a given: that our elections should be free and fair.\n\nThe forthcoming presidential election is likely to be among the most heated \u2014 and potentially unnerving \u2014 of our collective lives. Here\u2019s what some of UCLA\u2019s suffrage experts are doing to protect the integrity of voting rights for this election \u2014 and every other.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t take American democracy for granted\u201d\n\nRichard Hasen M.A. \u201988, J.D. \u201991, Ph.D. \u201992 calls it, perhaps understatedly, \u201ca precarious situation.\u201d The UCLA professor of law and political science and director of UCLA Law\u2019s Safeguarding Democracy Project says that \u201cwe seriously risked a subverted election in 2020, and the candidate who did that is still leading in the polls. Which says something about the state of American democracy right now.\u201d\n\n\u201c We seriously risked a subverted election in 2020, \u201d says Richard Hasen, \u201c and the candidate who did that is still leading in the polls. \u201d\n\nAlarmed and seeking to counteract what he saw as severe threats to the country\u2019s political infrastructure, in March 2022 Hasen convened a national, nonpartisan panel of 24 experts in law, media, politics and technology to lay out actionable recommendations for ways to protect election integrity. The group included \u201cliberals and conservatives and everyone,\u201d he says. \u201cWe may disagree about lots of things. We all agree that we need free and fair elections.\u201d\n\nThe group\u2019s subsequent report, \u201c24 for \u201924,\u201d released in September 2023, paints an alarming portrait of the fragility of our current voting system, which is under attack by a legion of bad actors willing to engage in active disenfranchisement and even violence \u2014 all in the service of \u201cprotecting\u201d a certain idea of America while aggressively undermining confidence in public institutions, including how votes are counted.\n\nEspecially concerning, Hasen finds, is that one of the most contested issues up for public debate is something that ideally shouldn\u2019t be one in the first place: the very process of how U.S. elections are held. Until recently, many around the world looked to the U.S. election process as a model, steeped in a precedent for order.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand, [Donald] Trump is essentially running on a claim that the last election was stolen, which it wasn\u2019t. On the other hand, Democrats claim a lot of voter suppression, which there isn\u2019t,\u201d Hasen says. \u201cWe end up having this system where people lose confidence in the election process and tend to believe the lies spread on social media and elsewhere.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, as he points out, public trust does not have an on/off switch. And for many, the argument ultimately becomes less about proving actual fraud and more about feeling a certain way.\n\nThe key to getting most people to accept election results? Hold fair elections. But what does that look like \u2014 and who decides what\u2019s \u201cfair\u201d? The \u201c24 for \u201924\u201d report lays out some sensible steps for rebuilding public trust in the process \u2014 for example, making sure that election officials who provide information about polling places and activity have verified social media accounts, and ensuring that media portrays vote counts and messaging impartially. In addition, Hasen and his colleagues run public seminars, continually meeting with the different groups most responsible for fair elections \u2014 everyone from election administrators to journalists to civil and voting rights groups and business and civic group leaders.\n\nStill, Hasen acknowledges just how challenging it is to put the genie back in the bottle and to convince outlets, officials and everyone else to adhere to truly impartial standards in light of the increasingly cutthroat, anything-for-ratings discourse none of us can seem to escape.\n\n\u201cWhen I grew up, we were a much less polarized country. We had a lot of civics education, but the idealistic version \u2014 \u2018Schoolhouse Rock!\u2019, if you remember,\u201d he says. \u201cToday, if you ask people how they would feel if their child married someone of a different race or religion, they are more tolerant than they were, which is progress. But if you ask them how they would feel if their child married someone of a different political party, they\u2019re much more upset about that.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re living in an era of both polarization and profound technological change. And those two things have come together to create this precarious moment where it\u2019s easy to input opinions about elections being \u2018stolen,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cDon\u2019t take American democracy for granted. It\u2019s like a marriage; you can\u2019t just assume that it goes on autopilot. You\u2019ve got to work at it and nurture it so that it doesn\u2019t atrophy.\u201d\n\n\u201cFighting discrimination that, ideally, we shouldn\u2019t have to be fighting yet again\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I was a college student, I was really interested in thinking about my community as an Asian American and why we aren\u2019t represented in a lot of conversations about politics,\u201d says Natalie Masuoka, a UCLA associate professor of political science and Asian American studies. \u201cI saw a missing story. It inspired me to conduct research that centers on race in politics.\u201d\n\nNatalie Masuoka says we need to look to the past for inspiration, \u201c to the history of civil rights as an example. The advances we \u2019 ve seen have been the product of a lot of hard work. \u201d\n\nAs the former chair of UCLA\u2019s Asian American Studies Department, Masuoka seeks to understand the political activism, behaviors and preferences of communities of color. Her academic and educational work took on a heightened focus, however, after the controversial 2013 Shelby County v. Holder case. That case saw the U.S. Supreme Court gut the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the landmark legislation that has increased representation and voting equality for communities of color for nearly 60 years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going through a challenging time, essentially fighting discrimination that, ideally, we shouldn\u2019t have to be fighting yet again,\u201d Masuoka says. \u201cIt would be great to be able to aim our efforts at other productive endeavors, like incorporating new voters into the system. Because of these various voting-rights rollbacks, communities and candidates of color are seeing their power diluted as they deal with intimidation and discrimination.\u201d\n\nSeeing the way the role of race in American politics has changed has long interested Masuoka, and with inevitable major demographic shifts across the country, these changes will only continue. For example, in its 2023 National Population Projections release, the U.S. Census Bureau projected that:\n\nBy 2100, the largest contributor to population growth in the U.S. will be immigration.\n\nBy 2030, more of the U.S. population will be 65 or older than will be under 18.\n\nBy 2060, non-Hispanic whites will dip below their current (2022) demographic dominance (58.9%) to a figure as low as 42.7%, while the Hispanic population will rise from 19.1% in 2022 to as high as 27.8%.\n\nAt Monterey Park \u2019s Lunar New Year festival, Masuoka hosted a booth with community partner CAUSE to collect survey data regarding voting experiences in L.A. County. Their findings? Asian language ballot translation is poor, and many Asian immigrants find translated materials difficult to use.\n\nIn light of all of this, Masuoka closely monitors turnout for voters of color and produces both community-facing and policy-oriented reports to focus on concerns, including a recent report she published on the role of race/ethnicity in citywide and city council district elections in Los Angeles. This quarter, she also partnered with the nonprofit Center for Asian Americans United for Self Empowerment to launch a project with 12 UCLA undergraduate students to study the causes of low voter turnout among Asian Americans in the San Gabriel Valley. Her hope is that the findings will foster the training of students to become policy advocates for Asian American voters.\n\nThe work never ends, and so it\u2019s especially crucial, she says, for everyone to see the historical, big-picture context for the current and future political reality.\n\n\u201cWe should look to the history of civil rights in this country as an example \u2014 the advances we\u2019ve seen have been the product of a lot of people, a lot of hard work and a lot of heart to lead to incremental gains over time,\u201d Masuoka says. \u201cWe should all respect the ongoing fights for the right to vote, see each of ourselves in this effort and remember: It really does take a community to blaze a trail toward social justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe good faith of American citizens is what is necessary\u201d\n\n\u201cThe first thing I think every citizen has to do \u2014 and none of us are great at it all the time \u2014 is to commit to honoring the election outcome, whether or not it went the way we wanted it to,\u201d says Chad Dunn, a UCLA lecturer in law. \u201cHeated election rhetoric should not prevent us from being open-minded about different ideas and different solutions to difficult problems.\u201d\n\nChad Dunn is inspired by what he sees in his students: \u201c It \u2019 s heartening to know that these young folks will leave UCLA and go to all corners of our country as ambassadors for democracy. \u201d\n\nDunn is the co-founder and legal director of the UCLA Voting Rights Project, a joint program of the Luskin School of Public Affairs, the UCLA School of Law and the UCLA Division of Social Sciences. The project operates under the understanding that the struggle to protect democracy \u2014 as a matter of politics, as well as a matter of law \u2014 will never be complete: that every generation has to resecure these rights.\n\nIn addition to education and research, the project runs a legal clinic where non-law students in areas such as social science and public policy become expert witnesses and advisors to legal teams engaged in voting-rights litigation. It also trains law students to find and work on real-world litigation on cases throughout the country in which voting rights are in jeopardy.\n\nOne example of the project\u2019s success: a case that dealt with Franklin County, Washington, which has a 52% Latino population but whose county commission had only ever elected white candidates over the past 20 years. Ultimately, local voters believed that the at-large voting structure \u2014 in which all voters across the county cast their ballots for all candidates, rather than electing members by district \u2014 diluted the voting power of Latinos.\n\nInvoking the federal Voting Rights Act, Dunn and the team brought a case to force the county to elect by district. They have since prevailed all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court, where the appeal remains pending.\n\n\u201cAssuming our success in that case holds \u2014 and I think it will \u2014 Latino citizens will elect a candidate of choice to the Franklin County Commission for the first time ever,\u201d Dunn says. \u201cBut there is a misconception out there that you have to be Black or Latino or Asian American or Native American to get the advantages of the Voting Rights Act. Its fundamental guarantee applies to and benefits everyone. We all should agree that there should be fair representation.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, even the idea of what is \u201cfair\u201d has become a highly contentious topic. The concept of equal access should be universally agreed upon. Instead, it\u2019s often used as a cudgel. \u201cIt\u2019s no question that the good faith of American citizens is what is necessary,\u201d Dunn says. \u201cTo paraphrase Ben Franklin, we have a republic if we can keep it.\u201d He sees hope in the students he works with: When he started at UCLA, an average of 10 students would sign up for each of the project\u2019s courses; now, the average class size is more than 50.\n\n\u201cEvery year, students across disciplines show up and are absolutely dedicated to the cause of preserving the right to vote for everyone,\u201d Dunn says. \u201cIt\u2019s heartening to know that these young folks will leave UCLA, the preeminent public university in the U.S., and go to all corners of our country as ambassadors for democracy.\u201d\n\nOur guiding principle is: How can we ensure that all Americans have the same equal right to vote, and the same equal right to elect candidates of their choice?\n\n\u201cVoting is the most important thing we can do\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to the current condition of democracy in America, I\u2019d say that, unfortunately, it seems to vary state by state right now,\u201d says Matt Barreto, professor of political science and Chicana/o studies, founder of the Latino Policy & Politics Institute and co-founder of the UCLA Voting Rights Project. \u201cWe should expect to have more national unifying standards: equal access to the vote, ensuring that all votes are counted, and districting with lines drawn fairly. But our Congress has not been able to get a consensus to pass any new national standards.\u201d\n\nMatt Bareto says whether big or little in scope, every voting rights issue now in the courts matters. \u201c All of those cases, \u201d he says, \u201c are equally important. \u201d\n\nEspecially concerning to Barreto is the public opinion fomented on Jan. 6, 2021, and the flurry of lawsuits subsequently filed by Rudy Giuliani and other Trump lawyers alleging voter fraud. While none of the suits were successful, the fact that it fell upon the court system to serve as a bulwark for civil rights serves as a reminder of the famous quote that the price of liberty is eternal vigilance.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to democracy, so far the judiciary has continued to work \u2014 but when it doesn\u2019t, that will become the point in time at which the separation of powers is lost, and we will have a constitutional crisis,\u201d Barreto says. \u201cWe could easily have reached that point in 2020 or 2021. We don\u2019t win every single case that gets filed. But what would cause me to become very nervous would be for judges to start uniformly striking down the Voting Rights Act.\u201d\n\nEnter the UCLA Voting Rights Project. Its litigation team monitors actions taken by cities and states that could restrict or dilute any community\u2019s ability to vote. Each of these potential cases is carefully researched and its data and voting patterns objectively analyzed. A matter is only taken to the courts if local partners and organizations in the community reach out to UCLA because they are frustrated about a lack of representation.\n\nEnsuring that every American has equal access to both the ballot box and to representation is especially resonant for Barreto, who remembers growing up in Kansas and going to a polling place with his father, who had proudly received his U.S. citizenship after moving to the U.S. from Peru. Voting in his first American election, Barreto\u2019s father had questions about the process, but there was no information available at the polls in Spanish. It fell to Barreto \u2014 like so many U.S.-born children of immigrants \u2014 to try and help his parent navigate the process. In doing so, he experienced firsthand the human reality of abstract ideals of justice \u2014 after all, whether they\u2019re national and era-defining or local and smaller scale, U.S. elections are decided by the votes cast by individuals, each of whom has a story, a perspective and a reason.\n\nBarreto carries this lesson about the importance of empowering all citizens to understand, access and exercise their voting rights with him in his work, celebrating recent rights victories in Alabama for Black voters, in Texas for Black and Latino voters, and in North Dakota for Sioux and other American Indian voters \u2014 with the latter two decisions being made by Trump-appointed judges. Whether the fight is at the Supreme Court or in a rural county in New Mexico, Barreto is out there, fighting.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked on little tiny cases and 30,000-person jurisdictions; I was a lead expert witness in the Florida lawsuit against Ron DeSantis that\u2019s ongoing right now in front of a three-judge panel, but then I also will be testifying about Dodge City, Kansas, which is 20,000 people,\u201d he says. \u201cAll of those cases are equally important, and it\u2019s been really exciting to see UCLA play a role in finding some of these local jurisdictions that often get overlooked. Our guiding principle is: How can we ensure that all Americans have the same equal right to vote, and the same equal right to elect candidates of their choice?\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we want to keep working on, no matter what the demographics of any city, county or the nation are,\u201d he adds. \u201cVoting is the most important thing we can do to ensure that our representative democracy is responsive to our voices. And to remind elected officials that they work for us.\u201d\n\nBrian Stauffer\n\nWhat YOU Can Do: Advice From the Experts Don\u2019t sit on the sidelines. Get involved when redistricting comes around to your city or county. Learn more about it; find out who\u2019s drawing the lines and why. In the meantime, be aware of the logistics of getting engaged: Be registered to vote, help other people in your community register, and be aware of the different deadlines and rules. Helping people in your community get registered to vote is one of the most important things that any of us can do. \u2014Matt Barreto Don\u2019t buy into the voter fraud narrative. Do not believe misconceptions, including that there\u2019s extensive voter fraud or illegal voting taking place. I\u2019ve handled election contests around the country, and it\u2019s not surprising to see some illegal voting, but the elections where the amount of voter fraud makes a difference are infinitesimally small and almost always on a smaller scale, where the vote spread is maybe five or six. So maybe every election cycle, you could have a county race where voter fraud impacted the outcome, but when you\u2019re talking about most elections \u2014 in cities, for Congress, for the president of the United States \u2014 voter fraud is not changing the outcome. People constantly sounding the alarm about voter fraud are usually motivated by reasons other than the truth. \u2014Chad Dunn Fact-check. Educate yourself, check your facts and do not share information that\u2019s not verified. Consider becoming a poll worker or volunteering for a campaign \u2014 there is a lot of room for public input in our system. And after an election concludes, if you\u2019re on the side that loses, don\u2019t assume illegitimacy based solely on that fact. \u2014Richard Hasen Keep your eye on the prize. Vote \u2014 and, as you do so, recognize how hard we\u2019ve worked to ensure equity for all Americans to have access to that right. I hope that is something everyone, regardless of their politics, remains mindful of. \u2014Natalie Masuoka",

Texas police and National Guard troops have taken over a city park on the Rio Grande, surrounding it with barbed wire and shipping containers and setting up armed patrols. Source: Getty Images 10,000 Migrant Crossings a Day Upend the US Presidential Election How the surge in border crossings bolstered Trump, put Biden on the defensive and exposed an outdated immigration system that no one likes.\n\nShare this article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe coils of barbed wire at the edge of Poncho Nevarez\u2019s ranch on the Rio Grande were meant as a deterrent. Instead, they just tore at the bodies and clothes of desperate migrants who clambered through to Eagle Pass, Texas.\n\nThe fence installed by the National Guard was, in Nevarez\u2019s view, both horribly barbaric and largely ineffective, like so much of the border-enforcement push that\u2019s popped up around his 500 acres\u2014the state police, the helicopters, the drones and river buoys.\n\n\u201cNone of this stuff solves the problem,\u201d said Nevarez, a former Democratic state lawmaker, as he stood next to a mound of discarded clothes, diapers and other detritus left behind by migrants on his land.\n\nPoncho Nevarez The belongings of migrants left behind on the property of Poncho Nevarez.\n\nImmigration has erupted into a defining issue of the 2024 ballot, with a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll finding it second only to the economy as voters\u2019 top concern. Courts are bogged down by unprecedented levels of cases\u2014federal agents encountered 10,000 people a day crossing the southern border in December\u2014and the tumult has exposed the US system as underfunded, opaque and bursting at the seams.\n\n\u201cThis is gonna decide who becomes the president, how it\u2019s handled,\u201d Nevarez said.\n\nDonald Trump has again made the border his signature issue as he seeks a return to the White House, telling agents they\u2019re \u201cin a war\u201d and sometimes borrowing rhetoric from White nationalist groups that warn about a \u201cpoisoning\u201d of the nation\u2019s blood.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has been put on the defensive, claiming his hands are tied without action from Congress to change laws. But it wasn\u2019t Trump who most effectively boxed in Biden over migrants in the first place. It was a fellow Republican, Texas Governor Greg Abbott.\n\nIn early 2022, with migration rebounding as pandemic restrictions faded, Abbott heard from Texas mayors, county judges and police chiefs about communities overrun with migrants dropped off by the Border Patrol.\n\n\u201cThey said they could not handle it anymore,\u201d Abbott said in an interview. \u201cI said I would help them out.\u201d\n\nSo Abbott and his aides came up with a plan\u2014which critics called politically motivated\u2014to bus migrants to Democratic \u201csanctuary cities.\u201d The first bus dropped migrants from Colombia, Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua near the Capitol. After that, others went to New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Denver and Los Angeles.\n\nA Texas Department of Public Safety helicopter spots migrants at the border. Barbed wire along the Rio Grande. The Firefly migrant processing center. Governor Abbott placed floating barriers in the Rio Grande to deter migrants from crossing into the state from Mexico.\n\nOther border hawks, including the governors of Florida and Arizona, followed suit with similar moves. As of early March, Texas had bused out more than 105,000 people.\n\n\u201cEvery state is now a border state, every town is now a border town,\u201d Trump said Tuesday during a campaign speech in Michigan.\n\nLeaving the migrants\u2014many poor, unauthorized to work and unprepared for cold winters\u2014on Democrats\u2019 doorsteps all of a sudden made it their problem to fix. City officials from New York and Chicago begged the Biden administration for help. With little aid forthcoming, even Democratic-led cities such as Denver ultimately paid to bus migrants to other destinations.\n\nIllinois Comptroller Susana Mendoza, a Democrat, criticized Abbott\u2019s busing as inhumane but said it worked to drive a wedge between local and federal officials. \u201cFrom a political perspective, you have to look at his move as his genius,\u201d she said.\n\nNew Migrants Made Up More Than 2% of People in Some Counties Number of migrants with new immigration court cases in 2023 Source: Department of Justice EOIR case data, released after FOIA requests by TRAC at Syracuse University\n\nThe buses also, paradoxically, appealed to some migrants as they arrived in Texas. While many arranged their own transportation to other parts of the country, others heard they could get a free ride, according to Valeria Wheeler, executive director of the Mission: Border Hope in Eagle Pass, which provides temporary shelter for migrants before they move on.\n\n\u201cRight when they enter our place, they\u2019re like, \u2018We want to go in the free buses,\u2019\u201d she said. They \u201chelp a lot of asylum seekers to move forward and go to their final destination or other places.\u201d\n\nValeria Wheeler\n\nWhere people try to enter the US is influenced by a number of factors such as cartel activity in Mexico, enforcement in the US, water levels in the Rio Grande and tips shared on social media. But one place stood out last year as a hot spot for crossings\u2014Eagle Pass, a city of 30,000 in Maverick County, previously best known outside Texas as a setting for Cormac McCarthy\u2019s novel No Country for Old Men.\n\nCity council member Monica Cruz, who is also a real estate agent, laments that the city is so strongly linked with illegal migration.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been dreaming of people knowing where Eagle Pass was,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want the wrong idea, or the bad attention.\u201d\n\nTexas police and National Guard troops take over a city park on the Rio Grande, surrounding it with barbed wire and shipping containers.\n\nAbbott responded to the surge by sending in state troopers and the National Guard, and they\u2019ve put on a show of force. A city park along the Rio Grande is surrounded by barbed wire and shipping containers. Troops in camouflage patrol the area with rifles. Helicopters and humvees are parked nearby.\n\nThe spectacle is part of Abbott\u2019s $11 billion Operation Lone Star border security initiative, which officials say has led to 500,000 apprehensions statewide and more than 40,000 criminal arrests.\n\nRead more: Texas Picks a Fight With Biden Over Powers at the Border\n\nThe crackdown is having an impact, according to Lieutenant Christopher Olivarez, a spokesman for the Department of Public Safety, who points out that arrivals in Eagle Pass fell to an average of a few hundred a day this year, from 2,000 at the end of last year. But he acknowledges that there\u2019s a whack-a-mole aspect to the effort, with more enforcement in one part of the border often pushing migrants a few miles downriver, or as far away as places like El Paso, Arizona or California.\n\nMigrants board a state sponsored bus to New York at Mission: Border Hope in Eagle Pass. Migrants are given a wristband and scanned before boarding a bus to New York. At Mission: Border Hope, signs in Spanish inform migrants of their location. An Ecuadorian family waits for the arrival of a Texas state-sponsored bus to New York.\n\n\u201cBy having these barriers, we\u2019re able to secure one area,\u201d he said. The goal \u201cis trying to prevent people from even stepping foot in that river.\u201d\n\nIn Washington, pressure to stem the tide of new arrivals has grown before November\u2019s vote. Biden\u2019s stance has hardened over the past few months, while Trump, who swept to the presidency in 2016 in part on a pledge to build a border wall, is now running his third campaign focused on immigration.\n\n\u201cThis is a Joe Biden invasion,\u201d Trump said while visiting Eagle Pass in February to shine a spotlight on the issue.\n\nTrump dealt with migration surges during his presidency too. There were about 850,000 southwest border \u201cencounters\u201d of migrants\u2014some are caught more than once\u2014in the 2019 fiscal year. That was almost twice as much as 2018. It has more than doubled since, with 2.5 million encounters in the 2023 fiscal year.\n\nMigrant encounters across the Mexican border hit a record in December, topping 300,000 for the first time, before falling to about 175,000 in January and 190,000 in February. They\u2019re typically lower in winter months and higher in the fall, right around the election.\n\nRepublicans have warned that bad actors can easily get in, and often try to link rising immigration to crime despite research that shows migrants are less likely to commit crimes than native-born citizens.\n\nBackpacks of migrants who were detained by law enforcement hang on the fence of a ranch owner near Eagle Pass.\n\nThe GOP has been particularly focused on the case of Laken Riley, a Georgia nursing student who police say was killed in February by a Venezuelan man who entered the country illegally but was released on parole.\n\nWhile most narcotics come into the country through official ports of entry, a porous border also makes it easier for drug smuggling. Texas border operations have seized 469 million lethal doses of fentanyl, according to the governor\u2019s office.\n\nMany migrants are also victims of crimes themselves, often extorted along their journey and frequently compelled to pay gangs for safe passage to the border.\n\nOlivarez said Texas enforcement is focused on illegal activity, though it\u2019s difficult to completely separate that from the broader issue of crossings. Gangs take advantage of diversions caused by migrants to smuggle drugs, money or weapons across.\n\n\u201cWhen you do have an influx of people coming across, it\u2019s gonna tie up every resource that we have along the border,\u201d he said. So the cartels will \u201cexploit more areas.\u201d\n\nLieutenant Christopher Olivarez of Texas Department of Public Safety.\n\nImmigration has exploded globally due to a confluence of factors, including the pandemic\u2019s economic fallout and political turmoil in countries such as Venezuela and Ecuador. The arrivals to the US once came overwhelmingly from Mexico and Central America, but now hail from all over the world. Analysts say the numbers have been boosted by a belief that it\u2019s now fairly easy to get across the US border and secure papers to start a tenuous new life while awaiting immigration court proceedings.\n\nThose migrants who turn themselves in to Border Patrol are mostly asylum seekers, and part of the challenge is evaluating who meets the criteria \u2013 standards Biden wants tightened. Sorting out claims is often a question of shades of gray of despair.\n\nAngel Feliz, 41, said he left the Dominican Republic in mid-February with his wife and 5-year-old son. After arriving in Mexico, they crossed the Rio Grande on March 9 and surrendered to US authorities in Eagle Pass. He said he made an appointment to request asylum and hoped to join relatives in Florida after a short stay at Mission: Border Hope.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m getting older and I don\u2019t want my son to have to do what I did, which was to work really hard for not much money,\u201d said the former parking attendant. \u201cWe think we can find a better future here, especially for our son.\u201d\n\nBiden began his presidency by proposing an immigration bill that called for a path to citizenship for young adults who were brought to the US as children. It also would have laid the groundwork for more legal immigration, as well as some border restrictions sought by Republicans. It went nowhere, just as efforts before it did.\n\nDuring his presidency, the powers to expel people have changed. Title 42, a pandemic-related health power that both Biden and Trump used widely to remove people, expired in May 2023. In the 11 months since, with border crossings at or near record levels, Biden has sent away 630,000 people, more than any pre-pandemic year under Trump.\n\nThe crisis led to frenzied talks among lawmakers in late 2023, ultimately yielding a bipartisan Senate deal. It was a breakthrough after years of false starts and included billions in new funding for enforcement.\n\nBut the bill swiftly collapsed under pressure from Trump, who said he didn\u2019t want to hand Biden a win in an election year. Biden is now campaigning on the idea that he had a plan to shore up the border, but was thwarted by Republicans.\n\n\u201cWe can fight about fixing the border, or we can fix it,\u201d he said in the State of the Union. \u201cSend me the border bill now.\u201d\n\nWooden crosses for a memorial held by the First United Methodist Church in Eagle Pass, representing each migrant life lost while crossing the US-Mexico border in 2023. The crosses marked with blue and pink represent migrant children who have died.\n\nThat tactic seemed to be effective for Tom Suozzi, who won a special election for a US House seat in suburban New York in February as he blamed the GOP for \u201cpolitical game-playing.\u201d\n\nBut immigration advocates have warned that Biden\u2019s sudden willingness to enact harsher border measures\u2014while designed to address a political weakness\u2014could cost him votes, too.\n\nCruz, the Eagle Pass city council member, says the border region needs sustained help, not political grandstanding. She\u2019s sick of national politicians coming to Eagle Pass to make speeches, but not actually helping.\n\n\u201cThey come take a picture and they leave,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a humanitarian crisis\u2014I mean, there\u2019s no other way to explain it.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s hopeful that the crisis will eventually lead to an overhaul in US immigration laws that will bring things under control. \u201cI honestly and truly believe that it\u2019s an open door to change things that haven\u2019t been changed for years,\u201d she said.\n\nNevarez, the ranch owner, knows all about the politics. A former Democratic lawmaker in the Texas House who is now sober after being caught with cocaine in 2019, he\u2019s dismayed by hardline Republican tactics and disillusioned by his own party\u2019s inability to offer an alternative.\n\nOn March 19, National Guard troops returned to his ranch and, at his request, cut away the barbed wire.\n\n\n\nMore On Bloomberg",

        "text": "Turkish local elections: Opposition stuns Erdogan with historic victory\nTurkish local elections: Opposition stuns Erdogan with historic victory\n\nREUTERS/Umit Bektas Opposition supporters celebrated in Istanbul and other cities as the scale of victory became clear\n\nTurkey's main opposition party has claimed big election victories in the main cities of Istanbul and Ankara.\n\nThe results are a significant blow for Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who had hoped to regain control of the cities less than a year after he claimed a third term as president.\n\nHe led the campaign to win in Istanbul, where he grew up and became mayor.\n\nBut Ekrem Imamoglu, who first won the city in 2019, scored a second victory for the secular opposition CHP.\n\nMr Erdogan had vowed a new era in Turkey's megacity of almost 16 million people, but the incumbent mayor of Istanbul secured more than 50% of the vote, defeating the president's AK Party candidate by more than 11 points and almost one million votes.\n\nThis was also the first time since Mr Erdogan came to power 21 years ago that his party was defeated across the country at the ballot box.\n\nIn the capital Ankara, opposition mayor Mansur Yavas was so far ahead of his rival on 60% that he declared victory when fewer than half the votes were in. Supporters blocked all the main roads in the city, waving flags and sounding their car horns.\n\nThe CHP - the Republican People's Party - won again in Izmir, Adana and the resort of Antalya. Significantly it also gained control of Turkey's fourth-biggest city Bursa and Balikesir in the north-west, as well as Adiyaman, which hit hard by last year's double earthquake in the south-east.\n\nPresident Erdogan, 70, acknowledged the election had not gone as he had hoped, but he told supporters in Ankara it would mark \"not an end for us but rather a turning point\".\n\nHe has always relied on the \"people's will\" for his authority and he told supporters he would respect the electorate now too.\n\nUnder Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey's presidency has amassed sweeping powers, replacing the prime minister. But in the cities, directly elected mayors still have considerable influence.\n\nDuring the election campaign, Mr Erdogan said this would be his last, because his presidential term ends in 2028.\n\nBut critics believed that victory would have encouraged him to revise the constitution so he could stand again. After such a dramatic defeat that is looking very unlikely.\n\nEmin Sansar/Anadolu via Getty Images President Erdogan promised supporters his party would learn its lessons from the defeat\n\nPolitical scientist Berk Esen said the opposition CHP had delivered the \"biggest election defeat of Erdogan's career\" and come up with its best results since 1977.\n\nThe outcome was a big success for the chairman of the CHP, Ozgur Ozel, who praised voters for deciding to change the face of Turkey in a historic vote: \"They want to open the door to a new political climate in our country.\"\n\nCrowds in Istanbul gathered outside the town hall in Sarachane, one of Istanbul's oldest districts.\n\nThey waved Turkish flags and banners showing Ekrem Imamoglu's picture alongside Turkey's founding father Kemal Ataturk, whose poster was draped down the walls of the local authority building.\n\n\"I can say that our citizens' trust and faith in us has been rewarded,\" said Mr Imamoglu.\n\nTOLGA BOZOGLU/EPA-EFE Ekrem Imamoglu won Istanbul for the opposition in 2019\n\nBoth he and Mansur Yavas are seen as potential candidates to run for the presidency in 2028.\n\n\"Everything will be fine,\" Imamoglu supporters chanted as they danced to drums and clarinets in Sarachane, one of Istanbul's oldest districts.\n\nIstanbul's incumbent mayor had first used the slogan when he won the city from Mr Erdogan's party five years ago. Some of the banners in Sarachane used his current slogan, \"Full speed ahead\".\n\n\"They're only local elections but the opposition's victory in big cities is a significant show of force against the ruling party,\" Imamoglu supporter Yesim Albayrak, 25, told the BBC.\n\nMehmet Bankaci, 27, told the BBC there was a need for change in Turkey: \"If Imamoglu or Mansur Yavas had been the CHP candidate in last year's presidential election, they definitely would have won.\"\n\nIstanbul hosts a fifth of Turkey's population of nearly 85 million people. Control the city and you control a significant portion of Turkey's economy including trade, tourism and finance.\n\nFive years ago, Mr Imamoglu overturned years of AK Party rule in Istanbul with the backing of other opposition parties. But that opposition unity fell apart in the wake of last year's presidential election defeat and the AK Party had high hopes of overturning his 2019 victory.\n\nAhead of Sunday's election, the vote had been seen as too close to call, with a strong challenge from AK Party candidate Murat Kurum.\n\nBut the ruling party has been unable to shake off an economic crisis that has seen inflation rates of 67% and interest rates at 50%.\n\nWhile broad swathes of the west, south and north of Turkey are now under the control of the opposition CHP, the pro-Kurdish Dem party has won control of much of the south-east.\n\nMr Erdogan's AK Party continues to dominate central Turkey and had more success in areas of the south-east devastated by the February 2023 double earthquake, including the cities of Kahramanmaras and Gaziantep, although it did lose control of Adiyaman.\n\nSpeaking from the balcony of his party headquarters in Ankara, he promised to use the four years before the next presidential election to \"renew ourselves and compensate for our mistakes\".\n\nHis supporters chanted back: \"Stand still, this nation is with you.\"",

        "text": "State of the Military Voter\nState of the Military Voter\n\nAbout three-quarters of the 1.3 million active duty military members are eligible to vote absentee with special protections because they're stationed away from their voting residence.\n\nVoting is more complicated for military members stationed away from home than for local voters. Some states require them to update their registration and request an absentee ballot every year. State's rules on how election paperwork can be sent and received may require the use of printers and scanners, or involve long mailing times. Most need to vote earlier than local voters so that their ballots are received by voting deadlines.\n\nTo learn more about military voters and help them navigate their state's absentee voting process, FVAP conducts the Post-Election Voting Survey \u2013 Active Duty Military (PEVS-ADM) every two years following the general election. The most recent report details military voting behaviors in 2022.\n\nThe Military Voter in 2022\n\nSince 1986, military members on active duty stationed away from their voting residence have been covered by the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA), which requires that states allow these military members, their eligible family, and overseas citizens to vote absentee in federal elections. The Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment (MOVE) Act amended UOCAVA in 2009 to require that states:\n\nTransmit ballots at least 45 days before federal elections\n\nOffer at least one method of electronic transmission (email, fax, online portal, etc.) of voting information and blank ballots\n\nTransmit ballots automatically within the calendar year of a standing ballot request\n\nOver the course of 3 presidential elections and 4 midterm elections since the UOCAVA amendments, voting data from the 2022 Midterm Election continues to show its impact on military voting. The amendments have given military members more time to vote by reducing time-related obstacles.\n\nIn 2022, 15% of military voters reported that either they didn't receive the ballot in time, or that the ballot never arrived, compared to 30% prior to the 2009 amendments. While UOCAVA has improved the military voting experience, there are still opportunities to support military members' ability to successfully vote absentee.\n\nHere are some highlights of military voting in 2022.",

        "text": "U.S. Trade Policy Is at a Crossroads\nFrom the end of the Second World War through the end of the Barack Obama administration, the meaning of U.S. leadership on trade was pretty clear: negotiating agreements to open markets in any country that was willing to do so. However, its definition is far from clear today. The administration of President Joe Biden has tried out approaches that put trade in the service of fighting climate change, empowering workers, discouraging monopolies, embracing U.S. allies, sanctioning Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, curbing Chinese influence, and bolstering U.S. manufacturing. But in the election year of 2024, that complex structure looks at risk of crashing from the weight of its own ambitions.\n\nU.S. trade policy was once fairly simple. Following the powerful insights of British political economist David Ricardo, countries that opened their markets to trade and investment by exporting what they produced best (and importing the rest) saw enormous\u2014and largely shared\u2014gains in wealth. The United States, with a huge consumer market and a slew of competitive multinational companies, considered itself a big winner from trade liberalization and encouraged agreements of every shape and size. As an added bonus, opening the U.S. market to imports helped to strengthen political alliances around the world. The job of American political leaders, therefore, was to keep negotiating trade agreements that provided ever more market opportunities for the United States and for other countries. It was a classic, and rare, win-win.\n\nOne version of U.S. leadership on trade calls for restoring that old model by launching new negotiations in Asia or Latin America that would further reduce tariffs or regulatory impediments to trade. Even if that were politically possible\u2014and with the Republican Party under Donald Trump abandoning its support for free trade it is almost certainly not\u2014the case for restoration is weak. With tariffs already at historic lows, the gains from further market-access negotiations are likely to be small. More importantly, restoration would not tackle any of the biggest contemporary challenges: accelerating the transition to green technologies, lifting stagnant wages, containing the risks of artificial intelligences, and maintaining power balances that discourage conflicts in Europe and Asia.\n\nFinding balance in Biden\u2019s broad trade agenda\n\nThe World This Week A weekly digest of the latest from CFR on the biggest foreign policy stories of the week, featuring briefs, opinions, and explainers.

Those efforts include U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai\u2019s worker-centered trade policy, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan\u2019s \u201csmall yards, high fences\u201d approach for controlling technology trade with China, and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen\u2019s friendshoring strategy for including allies in the clean energy supply chain. All represent serious efforts to build a trade policy for a more complex world.\n\nBut the Biden administration has yet to grapple with the contradictions among those different approaches. Take the recent $14.1 billion bid by Japan\u2019s Nippon Steel to purchase U.S. Steel, the Pittsburgh-based Industrial Age icon. On friendshoring grounds, Japan is a critical ally and blocking the acquisition would seem wholly unjustified. On clean energy grounds, steel companies are struggling to meet new EU requirements, which favor cleaner steel over products made with dirty carbon emissions; new investments from Nippon Steel could help to make the United States a global leader. But Biden has come out against the acquisition on \u201cworker-centered grounds,\u201d the United Steelworkers union opposes the deal, and Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH), who is in a tough reelection fight in a right-leaning state, says the deal would weaken trade enforcement.\n\nOr consider the likelihood of new tariffs on imports of solar panels from Southeast Asia. Both the Obama and Trump administrations put tariffs on panel imports from China, which are heavily subsidized by the Chinese government in violation of U.S. trade laws. Those tariffs shifted panel production to several Southeast Asian countries that are important to the United States, including Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. Some of that production is likely Chinese-made panels being shipped through the region, and the Commerce Department last year ruled that those products should face import tariffs, too.\n\nBut the Biden administration has suspended any collection of those tariffs until June as part of a two-year moratorium on new tariffs meant to keep down the costs of solar panels and encourage more Americans to install them on their homes. Solar panels from Southeast Asia (or China for that matter) pose no security threats, help the economies of U.S. allies, and encourage a quicker U.S. transition away from dirty energy. But the lower cost of imports also discourages American manufacturing, costing jobs in panel production (even as it increases jobs in installation). Senator Brown, along with Democratic senators from Georgia\u2014a critical electoral state\u2014are calling for the tariffs to be imposed. The president seems likely to comply.\n\nAll of these scenarios could be seen as the inevitable conflicts that emerge when trying to design new trade policies for a complex world. But one of the requirements of economic leadership is that countries should be seen as at least occasionally paying a price for their principles. In the free-trade era, the United States made politically unpopular decisions to lift import barriers in sectors such as textiles and apparel, and often complied with difficult rulings made by the now-neutered dispute-settlement panels of the World Trade Organization.\n\nThe biggest challenge for U.S. trade policy today is to acknowledge those trade-offs and find consistent approaches to resolving the contradictions. This could be too much to expect of the Biden administration in an election year, especially given the dangerous alternative. But until firmer ground can be found, U.S. claims for renewed leadership on trade will continue to ring hollow.",

        "text": "2024 Senegalese presidential election\nPresidential elections were held in Senegal on 24 March 2024. Incumbent president Macky Sall was ineligible to pursue a third term due to term limits in the Constitution of Senegal.[1]\n\nThe elections were originally scheduled for 25 February,[2][3] but were postponed indefinitely by a decree of Sall on 3 February,[4] and then delayed by the National Assembly to 15 December. However, on 15 February the Senegalese Constitutional Council overturned the postponement and ordered elections to proceed as soon as possible,[5] with the government subsequently setting a new election date for 24 March after a national dialogue at the end of February was ruled unconstitutional.[6][7]\n\nBassirou Diomaye Faye, running in place of Ousmane Sonko, was elected president with 54% of the vote, while Amadou Ba, the candidate of the ruling United in Hope (BBY) coalition, peacefully conceded defeat.[8] Faye's victory was later confirmed by Senegal's Supreme Court.[9] He was inaugurated as president on 2 April.\n\nBackground [ edit ]\n\nSeveral parties had announced their intent to run for office in 2024, but they first had to receive sufficient support from the general public to pass the sponsorship stage. Any presidential candidate must receive between 0.8 percent and 1 percent of the electorate's signatures. These signatures must be collected with at least 2,000 sponsorships in each of the seven of Senegal's fourteen regions.[3] Candidates can also have the option of receiving sponsorships from at least 13 members of the National Assembly, or 120 mayors and heads of regional councils. A deposit of 30 million CFA francs must also be paid by candidates at the Caisse des d\u00e9p\u00f4ts et consignations.[11]\n\nOn 17 February 2023, the day before the date was revealed for the upcoming elections, Senegalese opposition candidate Ousmane Sonko was forcibly taken from his vehicle amid rallies outside a Dakar courthouse where his trial was taking place. Sonko was in court as part of a civil lawsuit against him by Senegal's tourism minister for defamation and public insults.[12]\n\nOn 3 July, following a series of protests regarding Sonko's conviction for \"immoral behaviour\" in a separate case, incumbent president Macky Sall stated that he would not seek re-election for a third term.[13][14]\n\nRegistrations for candidacy opened in October 2023 and ended on 26 December 2023. Pre-campaigning began on 5 January 2024 while the campaign period was set to start on 4 February, with the first round taking place on 25 February.[11]\n\nOn 14 July, Ousmane Sonko was announced as the presidential candidate for PASTEF. Sonko's eligibility as a candidate was unclear due to him receiving a two-year prison sentence in June 2023, rendering him ineligible to run according to some legal experts; although it was noted he had not exhausted his appeals to the Supreme Court, which could reverse his sentence.[15] On 31 July, PASTEF was ordered dissolved by the Senegalese government,[16] while Sonko undertook a months-long hunger strike in protest over the political situation.[17]\n\nIn September, Sall nominated Prime Minister Amadou Ba as candidate for the ruling Alliance for the Republic.[18]\n\nOn 19 November, PASTEF designated its secretary-general Bassirou Diomaye Faye as their candidate for the election.[19] Faye had been imprisoned since April 2023, when he was arrested for criticising the conduct of Sonko's defamation trial on social media.[20] In December, a court ordered Sonko's reinstatement to the voters' list and allowed him to file his candidacy.[21]\n\nA total of 93 people registered to run for president before the Senegalese Constitutional Council. The list of candidates was narrowed down as the body examined the sponsorship of would-be candidates until 10 January 2024 before moving on to scrutinize other relevant documents. Many candidates were rejected due to missing documents, insufficient sponsors or sponsors supporting more than one candidate, including former prime ministers Aminata Toure and Cheikh Hadjibou Soumar\u00e9, as well as Macky Sall's brother-in-law Adama Faye. This prompted Toure and 27 other candidates to collectively criticise the sponsorship control system.\n\nIn January 2024, candidate Thierno Alassane Sall filed a complaint against fellow candidate Karim Wade being of dual French-Senegalese nationality.[22] Wade, a former minister and the son of former president Abdoulaye Wade, subsequently renounced his French citizenship.[23] At the same time, the National Assembly created a commission of inquiry responsible for monitoring the electoral process.[24]\n\nOn 20 January, the Senegalese Constitutional Council published the final list of candidates for the presidential election. It was made up of 20 candidates including Amadou Ba, former prime ministers Idrissa Seck and Mahammed Boun Abdallah Dionne, former interior minister Aly Ngouille Ndiaye, the former mayor of Dakar Khalifa Sall, the mayor of Kolda, Mame Boye Diao, and Bassirou Diomaye Faye, who was in prison pending a trial.[25][26][27] Two women were also cleared to run, namely gynaecologist Rose Wardini and entrepreneur Anta Babacar Ngom,[28] the head of one of the country's largest food manufacturers and poultry firms, Sedima.[29][30] Both are the first women to run for president since 2012.[31]\n\nThe candidacies of Ousmane Sonko and Karim Wade were not validated, with the council citing Sonko's six-month suspended sentence for defamation that was upheld by the Senegalese Supreme Court on 4 January and Wade's renunciation of his French citizenship being \"not retroactive\" and his sworn declaration of the renunciation being \"inexact\".[32] Wade's exclusion prompted the 25 MPs of his Senegalese Democratic Party to call for an inquiry in the National Assembly over Wade's and other candidates' exclusion,[28] which lasted until 18 February, when it was ended by the Senegalese government, citing the opening of a judicial investigation over the matter.[33]\n\nOn 28 January, Sonko released a video on social media formally recognizing Bassirou Diomaye Faye as his replacement in the election.[34]\n\nOn 19 February, Rose Wardini renounced her candidacy following controversy over her dual Franco-Senegalese nationality.[35]\n\nPostponement [ edit ]\n\nOn 3 February, hours before campaigning was about to start, President Macky Sall ordered the indefinite postponement of the election, citing a parliamentary investigation into two judges of the Constitutional Court over their integrity with regards to the electoral process that was launched following Karim Wade's exclusion from the elections and warning of adverse effects on the \"credibility of the election by creating the seeds of pre- and post-electoral litigation\". Sall also claimed that some of the official candidates held dual citizenship. This was the first postponement of a presidential election in the country's history.[4][36]\n\nThe postponement was welcomed by Wade's Democratic Party, which requested the postponement, while candidates Thierno Alassane Sall, who called the postponement \"high treason,\"[37] Khalifa Sall and D\u00e9thi\u00e9 Fall announced that they would start their campaign as originally scheduled,[38] while candidate Habib Sy said that all opposition candidates had agreed to launch their campaigns together as scheduled.[39] Rejected candidate Aminata Tour\u00e9 called the decision \"sabotage\".[36] Abdou Latif Coulibaly, the Secretary General of Sall's government and its concurrent spokesman, announced his resignation, saying that he wanted to have \"full and complete freedom\" to defend his political convictions.[40]\n\nOn 4 February, police in Dakar fired tear gas to disperse demonstrators protesting against the postponement and arrested Aminata Tour\u00e9 and candidate Anta Babacar Ngom,[41] who had attended one of the rallies after all 19 opposition candidates called for supporters to gather in the streets, including at a major roundabout and in front of the National Assembly. Authorities also suspended and later revoked the broadcasting license of the private television channel Walf TV for its coverage of the protests, calling it an \"incitement to violence\".[42][43][44] Protesters were seen chanting \"Macky Sall, dictator!\" and establishing makeshift barricades, burning tyres[39] and throwing rocks at police.[37] The Ministry of Communication, Telecommunications and Digital Economy shut off mobile internet access on 5 February, citing \"the dissemination of several hateful and subversive messages relayed on social networks in the context of threats and disturbances to public order.\"[45] Three people were killed during protests against the postponement in Saint-Louis, Dakar and Ziguinchor.[46] Protests were also held in Diourbel.[47]\n\nIn a heated session on 5 February that saw some opposition deputies removed by security forces after they tried to block proceedings, the National Assembly voted in favor of a proposal to postpone the elections until 15 December formally. The measure, which needed the support of at least three-fifths (99) of the chamber's 165 deputies to pass, was approved by 105 members and rejected by only one MP and prompted renewed protests outside the National Assembly that were suppressed by police using tear gas. Two opposition parties subsequently filed an appeal to the Constitutional Council urging it to direct \"the continuation of the electoral process.\"[42][48][49] Fourteen opposition candidates also filed an appeal to the council,[50] with two others pledging to challenge the postponement in court.[51] Three lawmakers who were affiliated with PASTEF were briefly arrested on 6 February.[52]\n\nIn response to the postponement and subsequent protests, former presidents Abdou Diouf and Abdoulaye Wade called on Macky Sall to organise the \"national dialogue he has announced, without delay.\" They also called on protesters to \"immediately end the violence.\"[53]\n\nInternational reactions [ edit ]\n\nThe French foreign ministry called on Senegalese authorities \"to end the uncertainty about the electoral calendar so the vote can be held as soon as possible.\"[40] The US State Department also urged \"all participants in (the) electoral process to engage peacefully to swiftly set a new date and the conditions for a timely, free and fair election\".[54] US Senate Foreign Relations Committee chair Ben Cardin said the postponement put Senegal \"on a dangerous path towards dictatorship, and must not be allowed to stand.\"[55]\n\nECOWAS called on authorities to \"expedite the various processes to set a new date for the elections\",[54] while African Union commission chair Moussa Faki Mahamat urged a resolution of the political crisis \"through consultation, understanding and dialogue\" and called on authorities to \"organise the elections as quickly as possible, in transparency, in peace and national harmony\".[43] The European Union also said the postponement had opened a \"period of uncertainty\" and called \"for the staging of a transparent, inclusive and credible election as soon as possible.\"[40] United Nations Human Rights Office spokesperson Liz Throssell said any decision to postpone the elections should be \"based on broad-based consultations.\"[55] On 8 February, foreign ministers of ECOWAS member states held an emergency session in Abuja, Nigeria, to discuss the situation in Senegal.[56] On 12 February, an ECOWAS delegation arrived in the country to attempt to help mediate.[57]\n\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists condemned the Senegalese government's shutdown of Walf TV.[41]\n\nOverturning of postponement and resumption of elections [ edit ]\n\nOn 15 February, the Senegalese Constitutional Council ruled that the decision to postpone and reschedule the election by Macky Sall and the National Assembly was \"contrary to the constitution\" and ordered its cancellation.[58] However, it also acknowledged that holding the election as originally scheduled on 25 February was no longer feasible, and urged the government to act immediately. In response, presidential spokesperson Yoro Dia said that Sall would comply with the decision, but did not give a new date for it to be held.[5] In a televised interview on 22 February, Sall said that he would leave office as scheduled on 2 April, but said that he would hold talks first with political leaders to determine a new timetable for the elections.[59] He also expressed his willingness to release Ousmane Sonko and his supporters as an act of good faith.[60] His proposal for a dialogue was rejected on 23 February by the Aar Sunu Election (Protect Our Election) collective composed of 40 civil society groups, which called it \"unacceptable\" and an \"attempt at diversion\".[61]\n\nDuring the week that the postponement was overturned, several hundred political prisoners were released by the government.[62] At a protest in Dakar on 17 February, opposition candidate Malick Gakou [fr] called for the election to be held in March to ensure the departure of Macky Sall from the presidency as previously scheduled on 2 April.[63] A total of 15 candidates have called for elections to be held before 2 April.[64] On the original date of the elections on 25 February, candidates held a mock vote with them slipping ballot papers into a box bearing the words \"RIP 25 February.\"[65] In the end of February, the government tabled an amnesty bill to calm the social and political climate.[66]\n\nDuring a national dialogue in Diamniadio that was boycotted by the opposition and was attended only by Amadou Ba and another candidate on 26 February, Macky Sall announced that elections would be held before the start of the rainy season in July, and reiterated his commitment to leave office as scheduled in April. In response, Aar Sunu Election, which also boycotted the proceedings, called for a general strike on 27 February.[67][66] On the second and final day of the national dialogue on 27 February, a panel composed of civil, political and religious leaders proposed holding the presidential elections on 2 June, and recommended a review of the disqualification of Karim Wade and other presidential candidates.[68]\n\nOn 6 March, the government set the first round of the elections on 24 March after the constitutional court ruled the national dialogue was unconstitutional.[7] Macky Sall dismissed Amadou Ba as prime minister to allow him to focus on his election campaign and replaced him with Interior Minister Sidiki Kaba.[69] The Constitutional Council approved of the new date on 7 March.[70] On 14 March, days before the election, Sonko and Faye were released from prison, following the passage of the amnesty bill, granting them a few days of campaigning.[71]\n\nIn an interview with the BBC on 20 March, Macky Sall rejected responsibility for the political crisis caused by his decision to postpone the election, saying \"I don't owe any apology, I abided by the law\".[72]\n\nCampaign [ edit ]\n\nCampaigning began on 9 March and ended on 22 March, but was complicated by it occurring during Ramadan, during which many activities were shut down for the day.[30][73] This forced some candidates to resort to online strategies.[74]\n\nThe election took place amid several socioeconomic affecting Senegal, such as high unemployment among the youth, increases in the cost of living, and questions over the management of domestic oil and gas production which is expected to begin in 2024.[75]\n\nBassirou Diomaye Faye campaigned on creating jobs, taking a strong stance against corruption, and vowing to reexamine energy contracts.[76] He ran under the slogan \"Diomaye mooy Ousmane\", which means \"Diomaye is Ousmane\" in Wolof, and expressed hope that Sonko's charisma and popular appeal amongst Senegal's youth would boost his campaign.[77] Faye's program is similar with Sonko's for 2019.[78] Faye announced his intentions to implement a monetary reform to finance the economy of Senegal, removing the CFA franc as the country's currency. In his program, he states that he would \"carry out a monetary reform that will allow our country to have its own currency\", however he added that \u201cthe creation of a currency requires the respect of the stages of the process\u201d.[79] He added in a press conference that he believed that there was \"no sovereignty if there is no monetary sovereignty.\"[80] After concern from foreign investors, in March he said that he would implement \"monetary reform at the sub-regional level first\", before considering to create a national currency.[80] He also supported extending the fishing zone exclusive for local fishermen by 20 kilometers to offset losses from foreign fishing fleets.[81] During the campaign, Faye released a declaration of his assets and called on other candidates to follow suit.[82]\n\nAmadou Ba said that he sought to represent continuity and stability. He vowed to continue the legacy of Macky Sall with a positive investment climate and said that a vote for him was a vote for \"greater peace and prosperity\". He criticized Faye and Sonko saying their proposals were radical and labeled them as \"bandits\"'. He argued his ministerial track record proved he would oversee development and create one million jobs in five years.[74]\n\nKhalifa Sall ran on a platform of sustainable development, particularly on responsible water management and equitable land distribution.[29] Mahammed Boun Abdallah Dionne ran on a platform focusing on Senegal's \"economic sovereignty\".[29] However, Dionne fell ill during the campaign and was hospitalized in Paris, where he later died on 5 April.[83] Anta Babacar Ngom meanwhile called for the strengthening of the private sector, free healthcare and reformation of the education system, including increased recognition for indigenous languages.[29]\n\nOn 15 March, a day after Faye's release from jail, he gathered hundreds of supporters at his first public appearance as a presidential contender.[84] Former president Abdoulaye Wade and his Senegalese Democratic Party (PDS) endorsed Faye on the same day, following the disqualification of his son Karim Wade.[85] Cheikh Tidiane Dieye, another candidate in the presidential election, withdrew in favor of Faye.[86] Former prime minister Aminata Tour\u00e9, who had a public falling out with Macky Sall and left the ruling coalition in 2023, also backed Faye.[84]\n\nConduct [ edit ]\n\nOn 23 March, the electoral observation mission of the Economic Community of Central African States (CEMAC) called for an \"inclusive and incident-free presidential vote\".[87]\n\nFive hundred observers were stationed at polling offices around the country and another 500 traveled between sites to monitor the vote. Their mission was to make sure voting opens on time and whether candidates were present at the count, as well as watching for any interference or irregularities. A coalition of Senegalese civil society groups, known collectively as Cosce, was also involved in the observation mission.[88]\n\nShortly after polling closed, a visiting government delegation in Saint-Louis was pelted with stones after entering a closed polling station.[89]\n\nMalin Bj\u00f6rk, who headed a group of 100 observers from the European Union that monitored 40 polling stations across the country, said that the vote \"took place in a calm environment and was well-organized.\"[90]\n\nAn ECOWAS monitoring team sent to the country said that the election was conducted \"smoothly\".[91]\n\nResults [ edit ]\n\nReactions [ edit ]\n\nDomestic [ edit ]\n\nOfficial results were released and validated by the constitutional court on 29 March,[93] but even before the preliminary results of the first round were released on 26 March,[94] at least seven candidates, including Anta Babacar Ngom and D\u00e9thi\u00e9 Fall, had already conceded defeat to Bassirou Diomaye Faye.[95] This came after the first set of tallies announced showed Faye had won the majority of votes in the first round, triggering widespread street celebrations in Dakar.[96] Hours later, the ruling party's candidate, Amadou Ba, conceded defeat with congratulations to Faye. Reacting to his victory, Faye pledged to \"govern with humility and transparency, and to fight corruption at all levels\", and to devote himself to \"rebuilding our institutions\".[97]\n\nOutgoing president Macky Sall also congratulated Faye, hailing \"a victory for Senegalese democracy\".[98][99]\n\nFaye's victory is the first instance that an opposition candidate won an election in the first round since Senegal's independence in 1960.[93] Faye was officially inaugurated as president on 2 April.[100]\n\nThe annual Independence Day parade in Dakar on 4 April was cancelled, with authorities citing the uncertainty caused by the election campaign.[101]\n\nInternational [ edit ]\n\nSee also [ edit ]",

In New York, Joe Biden won on the Democratic side and Donald Trump was victorious on the Republican side.\n\nBoth easily won in Connecticut, as well.\n\nFor New York election results, please click here\n\nFor Connecticut election results, please click here\n\nThe candidates are clearly looking to the general election and targeting issues important to women.\n\n\"You know, the suburban housewives actually like Donald Trump. You know why? Because I'm the one that's going to keep them safe. They like to say, well, the suburban housewives, I don't know. I think I do great with the suburban housewives,\" Trump said.\n\nThe Biden campaign was focused Tuesday on abortion, launching a commercial one day after Florida's Supreme Court cleared the way for a six-week abortion ban to go into effect in the state next month.\n\n\"I'm running to make Rowe v. Wade the law of the land again so women have a federal guarantee of the right to choose. Donald Trump doesn't trust women. I do,\" Biden says on the ad.\n\nIn Connecticut, Democrats could vote \"Uncommitted\" to oppose the president's handling of the Israel-Hamas war. New Yorkers didn't have that option, but activists who wanted to send the president a message urged people to \"Leave it blank.\"\n\nWe won't know how many left them blank until the vote is certified in a couple of weeks.",

        "text": "Every Vote Counts. But Who\u2019s Counting?\nAfter the immortal earworm \u201cGroove Is in the Heart,\u201d perhaps the most enduring song by the psychedelic party band Deee-Lite, is a 30-second PSA released in 1992 titled \u201cVote, Baby, Vote.\u201d\n\nThe political and popular cultural landscapes have shifted considerably since the 1990s. Back then, the idea of enthusiastically participating in the electoral process and accepting the results, win or lose \u2014 \u201cAre you registered, baby?\u201d Deee-Lite\u2019s Lady Miss Kier sang between go-go kicks \u2014 was wholeheartedly encouraged across party lines, even by those not watching MTV.\n\nJingles aside, voting in the U.S. has always been a serious business. It\u2019s sobering to remember that countless people have devoted their lives, and sometimes literally given them, simply to earn the right to vote in the United States. And yet, according to Pew Research Center, only about 66% of the voting-eligible population cast their votes in the 2020 presidential election, one of the most consequential in the nation\u2019s history. It\u2019s hardly a surprise that public trust in the federal government hit near-record lows in 2023.\n\nToday, as Americans find themselves, thanks to technology, more interconnected than ever, a glimpse into the funhouse mirror of social media reveals a country increasingly politically polarized, fragmented and heated, with no cooling in sight. The contrast is especially harsh as the 2024 presidential election ramps up, with so much at stake \u2014 locally, nationally and globally.\n\n\u201cWhat happens in the next two, three, four years is going to determine what the next four or five decades are going to look like,\u201d President Joe Biden remarked at a campaign stop in November. \u201cMore change is going to occur in the next 10 years than occurred in the last 50 years.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a reason that lands so ominously. Voting rights are under unprecedented attack across the country, as politics gets nastier and no tactic to gain advantage seems to be off limits. Luckily, though, there is an armada of people fighting to retain and protect voting rights in this country, among them a team from UCLA on the front lines of this highly charged, ever-changing battle. They\u2019re all seeking to preserve the idea of what was once a given: that our elections should be free and fair.\n\nThe forthcoming presidential election is likely to be among the most heated \u2014 and potentially unnerving \u2014 of our collective lives. Here\u2019s what some of UCLA\u2019s suffrage experts are doing to protect the integrity of voting rights for this election \u2014 and every other.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t take American democracy for granted\u201d\n\nRichard Hasen M.A. \u201988, J.D. \u201991, Ph.D. \u201992 calls it, perhaps understatedly, \u201ca precarious situation.\u201d The UCLA professor of law and political science and director of UCLA Law\u2019s Safeguarding Democracy Project says that \u201cwe seriously risked a subverted election in 2020, and the candidate who did that is still leading in the polls. Which says something about the state of American democracy right now.\u201d\n\n\u201c We seriously risked a subverted election in 2020, \u201d says Richard Hasen, \u201c and the candidate who did that is still leading in the polls. \u201d\n\nAlarmed and seeking to counteract what he saw as severe threats to the country\u2019s political infrastructure, in March 2022 Hasen convened a national, nonpartisan panel of 24 experts in law, media, politics and technology to lay out actionable recommendations for ways to protect election integrity. The group included \u201cliberals and conservatives and everyone,\u201d he says. \u201cWe may disagree about lots of things. We all agree that we need free and fair elections.\u201d\n\nThe group\u2019s subsequent report, \u201c24 for \u201924,\u201d released in September 2023, paints an alarming portrait of the fragility of our current voting system, which is under attack by a legion of bad actors willing to engage in active disenfranchisement and even violence \u2014 all in the service of \u201cprotecting\u201d a certain idea of America while aggressively undermining confidence in public institutions, including how votes are counted.\n\nEspecially concerning, Hasen finds, is that one of the most contested issues up for public debate is something that ideally shouldn\u2019t be one in the first place: the very process of how U.S. elections are held. Until recently, many around the world looked to the U.S. election process as a model, steeped in a precedent for order.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand, [Donald] Trump is essentially running on a claim that the last election was stolen, which it wasn\u2019t. On the other hand, Democrats claim a lot of voter suppression, which there isn\u2019t,\u201d Hasen says. \u201cWe end up having this system where people lose confidence in the election process and tend to believe the lies spread on social media and elsewhere.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, as he points out, public trust does not have an on/off switch. And for many, the argument ultimately becomes less about proving actual fraud and more about feeling a certain way.\n\nThe key to getting most people to accept election results? Hold fair elections. But what does that look like \u2014 and who decides what\u2019s \u201cfair\u201d? The \u201c24 for \u201924\u201d report lays out some sensible steps for rebuilding public trust in the process \u2014 for example, making sure that election officials who provide information about polling places and activity have verified social media accounts, and ensuring that media portrays vote counts and messaging impartially. In addition, Hasen and his colleagues run public seminars, continually meeting with the different groups most responsible for fair elections \u2014 everyone from election administrators to journalists to civil and voting rights groups and business and civic group leaders.\n\nStill, Hasen acknowledges just how challenging it is to put the genie back in the bottle and to convince outlets, officials and everyone else to adhere to truly impartial standards in light of the increasingly cutthroat, anything-for-ratings discourse none of us can seem to escape.\n\n\u201cWhen I grew up, we were a much less polarized country. We had a lot of civics education, but the idealistic version \u2014 \u2018Schoolhouse Rock!\u2019, if you remember,\u201d he says. \u201cToday, if you ask people how they would feel if their child married someone of a different race or religion, they are more tolerant than they were, which is progress. But if you ask them how they would feel if their child married someone of a different political party, they\u2019re much more upset about that.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re living in an era of both polarization and profound technological change. And those two things have come together to create this precarious moment where it\u2019s easy to input opinions about elections being \u2018stolen,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cDon\u2019t take American democracy for granted. It\u2019s like a marriage; you can\u2019t just assume that it goes on autopilot. You\u2019ve got to work at it and nurture it so that it doesn\u2019t atrophy.\u201d\n\n\u201cFighting discrimination that, ideally, we shouldn\u2019t have to be fighting yet again\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I was a college student, I was really interested in thinking about my community as an Asian American and why we aren\u2019t represented in a lot of conversations about politics,\u201d says Natalie Masuoka, a UCLA associate professor of political science and Asian American studies. \u201cI saw a missing story. It inspired me to conduct research that centers on race in politics.\u201d\n\nNatalie Masuoka says we need to look to the past for inspiration, \u201c to the history of civil rights as an example. The advances we \u2019 ve seen have been the product of a lot of hard work. \u201d\n\nAs the former chair of UCLA\u2019s Asian American Studies Department, Masuoka seeks to understand the political activism, behaviors and preferences of communities of color. Her academic and educational work took on a heightened focus, however, after the controversial 2013 Shelby County v. Holder case. That case saw the U.S. Supreme Court gut the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the landmark legislation that has increased representation and voting equality for communities of color for nearly 60 years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going through a challenging time, essentially fighting discrimination that, ideally, we shouldn\u2019t have to be fighting yet again,\u201d Masuoka says. \u201cIt would be great to be able to aim our efforts at other productive endeavors, like incorporating new voters into the system. Because of these various voting-rights rollbacks, communities and candidates of color are seeing their power diluted as they deal with intimidation and discrimination.\u201d\n\nSeeing the way the role of race in American politics has changed has long interested Masuoka, and with inevitable major demographic shifts across the country, these changes will only continue. For example, in its 2023 National Population Projections release, the U.S. Census Bureau projected that:\n\nBy 2100, the largest contributor to population growth in the U.S. will be immigration.\n\nBy 2030, more of the U.S. population will be 65 or older than will be under 18.\n\nBy 2060, non-Hispanic whites will dip below their current (2022) demographic dominance (58.9%) to a figure as low as 42.7%, while the Hispanic population will rise from 19.1% in 2022 to as high as 27.8%.\n\nAt Monterey Park \u2019s Lunar New Year festival, Masuoka hosted a booth with community partner CAUSE to collect survey data regarding voting experiences in L.A. County. Their findings? Asian language ballot translation is poor, and many Asian immigrants find translated materials difficult to use.\n\nIn light of all of this, Masuoka closely monitors turnout for voters of color and produces both community-facing and policy-oriented reports to focus on concerns, including a recent report she published on the role of race/ethnicity in citywide and city council district elections in Los Angeles. This quarter, she also partnered with the nonprofit Center for Asian Americans United for Self Empowerment to launch a project with 12 UCLA undergraduate students to study the causes of low voter turnout among Asian Americans in the San Gabriel Valley. Her hope is that the findings will foster the training of students to become policy advocates for Asian American voters.\n\nThe work never ends, and so it\u2019s especially crucial, she says, for everyone to see the historical, big-picture context for the current and future political reality.\n\n\u201cWe should look to the history of civil rights in this country as an example \u2014 the advances we\u2019ve seen have been the product of a lot of people, a lot of hard work and a lot of heart to lead to incremental gains over time,\u201d Masuoka says. \u201cWe should all respect the ongoing fights for the right to vote, see each of ourselves in this effort and remember: It really does take a community to blaze a trail toward social justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe good faith of American citizens is what is necessary\u201d\n\n\u201cThe first thing I think every citizen has to do \u2014 and none of us are great at it all the time \u2014 is to commit to honoring the election outcome, whether or not it went the way we wanted it to,\u201d says Chad Dunn, a UCLA lecturer in law. \u201cHeated election rhetoric should not prevent us from being open-minded about different ideas and different solutions to difficult problems.\u201d\n\nChad Dunn is inspired by what he sees in his students: \u201c It \u2019 s heartening to know that these young folks will leave UCLA and go to all corners of our country as ambassadors for democracy. \u201d\n\nDunn is the co-founder and legal director of the UCLA Voting Rights Project, a joint program of the Luskin School of Public Affairs, the UCLA School of Law and the UCLA Division of Social Sciences. The project operates under the understanding that the struggle to protect democracy \u2014 as a matter of politics, as well as a matter of law \u2014 will never be complete: that every generation has to resecure these rights.\n\nIn addition to education and research, the project runs a legal clinic where non-law students in areas such as social science and public policy become expert witnesses and advisors to legal teams engaged in voting-rights litigation. It also trains law students to find and work on real-world litigation on cases throughout the country in which voting rights are in jeopardy.\n\nOne example of the project\u2019s success: a case that dealt with Franklin County, Washington, which has a 52% Latino population but whose county commission had only ever elected white candidates over the past 20 years. Ultimately, local voters believed that the at-large voting structure \u2014 in which all voters across the county cast their ballots for all candidates, rather than electing members by district \u2014 diluted the voting power of Latinos.\n\nInvoking the federal Voting Rights Act, Dunn and the team brought a case to force the county to elect by district. They have since prevailed all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court, where the appeal remains pending.\n\n\u201cAssuming our success in that case holds \u2014 and I think it will \u2014 Latino citizens will elect a candidate of choice to the Franklin County Commission for the first time ever,\u201d Dunn says. \u201cBut there is a misconception out there that you have to be Black or Latino or Asian American or Native American to get the advantages of the Voting Rights Act. Its fundamental guarantee applies to and benefits everyone. We all should agree that there should be fair representation.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, even the idea of what is \u201cfair\u201d has become a highly contentious topic. The concept of equal access should be universally agreed upon. Instead, it\u2019s often used as a cudgel. \u201cIt\u2019s no question that the good faith of American citizens is what is necessary,\u201d Dunn says. \u201cTo paraphrase Ben Franklin, we have a republic if we can keep it.\u201d He sees hope in the students he works with: When he started at UCLA, an average of 10 students would sign up for each of the project\u2019s courses; now, the average class size is more than 50.\n\n\u201cEvery year, students across disciplines show up and are absolutely dedicated to the cause of preserving the right to vote for everyone,\u201d Dunn says. \u201cIt\u2019s heartening to know that these young folks will leave UCLA, the preeminent public university in the U.S., and go to all corners of our country as ambassadors for democracy.\u201d\n\nOur guiding principle is: How can we ensure that all Americans have the same equal right to vote, and the same equal right to elect candidates of their choice?\n\n\u201cVoting is the most important thing we can do\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to the current condition of democracy in America, I\u2019d say that, unfortunately, it seems to vary state by state right now,\u201d says Matt Barreto, professor of political science and Chicana/o studies, founder of the Latino Policy & Politics Institute and co-founder of the UCLA Voting Rights Project. \u201cWe should expect to have more national unifying standards: equal access to the vote, ensuring that all votes are counted, and districting with lines drawn fairly. But our Congress has not been able to get a consensus to pass any new national standards.\u201d\n\nMatt Bareto says whether big or little in scope, every voting rights issue now in the courts matters. \u201c All of those cases, \u201d he says, \u201c are equally important. \u201d\n\nEspecially concerning to Barreto is the public opinion fomented on Jan. 6, 2021, and the flurry of lawsuits subsequently filed by Rudy Giuliani and other Trump lawyers alleging voter fraud. While none of the suits were successful, the fact that it fell upon the court system to serve as a bulwark for civil rights serves as a reminder of the famous quote that the price of liberty is eternal vigilance.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to democracy, so far the judiciary has continued to work \u2014 but when it doesn\u2019t, that will become the point in time at which the separation of powers is lost, and we will have a constitutional crisis,\u201d Barreto says. \u201cWe could easily have reached that point in 2020 or 2021. We don\u2019t win every single case that gets filed. But what would cause me to become very nervous would be for judges to start uniformly striking down the Voting Rights Act.\u201d\n\nEnter the UCLA Voting Rights Project. Its litigation team monitors actions taken by cities and states that could restrict or dilute any community\u2019s ability to vote. Each of these potential cases is carefully researched and its data and voting patterns objectively analyzed. A matter is only taken to the courts if local partners and organizations in the community reach out to UCLA because they are frustrated about a lack of representation.\n\nEnsuring that every American has equal access to both the ballot box and to representation is especially resonant for Barreto, who remembers growing up in Kansas and going to a polling place with his father, who had proudly received his U.S. citizenship after moving to the U.S. from Peru. Voting in his first American election, Barreto\u2019s father had questions about the process, but there was no information available at the polls in Spanish. It fell to Barreto \u2014 like so many U.S.-born children of immigrants \u2014 to try and help his parent navigate the process. In doing so, he experienced firsthand the human reality of abstract ideals of justice \u2014 after all, whether they\u2019re national and era-defining or local and smaller scale, U.S. elections are decided by the votes cast by individuals, each of whom has a story, a perspective and a reason.\n\nBarreto carries this lesson about the importance of empowering all citizens to understand, access and exercise their voting rights with him in his work, celebrating recent rights victories in Alabama for Black voters, in Texas for Black and Latino voters, and in North Dakota for Sioux and other American Indian voters \u2014 with the latter two decisions being made by Trump-appointed judges. Whether the fight is at the Supreme Court or in a rural county in New Mexico, Barreto is out there, fighting.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked on little tiny cases and 30,000-person jurisdictions; I was a lead expert witness in the Florida lawsuit against Ron DeSantis that\u2019s ongoing right now in front of a three-judge panel, but then I also will be testifying about Dodge City, Kansas, which is 20,000 people,\u201d he says. \u201cAll of those cases are equally important, and it\u2019s been really exciting to see UCLA play a role in finding some of these local jurisdictions that often get overlooked. Our guiding principle is: How can we ensure that all Americans have the same equal right to vote, and the same equal right to elect candidates of their choice?\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we want to keep working on, no matter what the demographics of any city, county or the nation are,\u201d he adds. \u201cVoting is the most important thing we can do to ensure that our representative democracy is responsive to our voices. And to remind elected officials that they work for us.\u201d\n\nBrian Stauffer\n\nWhat YOU Can Do: Advice From the Experts Don\u2019t sit on the sidelines. Get involved when redistricting comes around to your city or county. Learn more about it; find out who\u2019s drawing the lines and why. In the meantime, be aware of the logistics of getting engaged: Be registered to vote, help other people in your community register, and be aware of the different deadlines and rules. Helping people in your community get registered to vote is one of the most important things that any of us can do. \u2014Matt Barreto Don\u2019t buy into the voter fraud narrative. Do not believe misconceptions, including that there\u2019s extensive voter fraud or illegal voting taking place. I\u2019ve handled election contests around the country, and it\u2019s not surprising to see some illegal voting, but the elections where the amount of voter fraud makes a difference are infinitesimally small and almost always on a smaller scale, where the vote spread is maybe five or six. So maybe every election cycle, you could have a county race where voter fraud impacted the outcome, but when you\u2019re talking about most elections \u2014 in cities, for Congress, for the president of the United States \u2014 voter fraud is not changing the outcome. People constantly sounding the alarm about voter fraud are usually motivated by reasons other than the truth. \u2014Chad Dunn Fact-check. Educate yourself, check your facts and do not share information that\u2019s not verified. Consider becoming a poll worker or volunteering for a campaign \u2014 there is a lot of room for public input in our system. And after an election concludes, if you\u2019re on the side that loses, don\u2019t assume illegitimacy based solely on that fact. \u2014Richard Hasen Keep your eye on the prize. Vote \u2014 and, as you do so, recognize how hard we\u2019ve worked to ensure equity for all Americans to have access to that right. I hope that is something everyone, regardless of their politics, remains mindful of. \u2014Natalie Masuoka",

Texas police and National Guard troops have taken over a city park on the Rio Grande, surrounding it with barbed wire and shipping containers and setting up armed patrols. Source: Getty Images 10,000 Migrant Crossings a Day Upend the US Presidential Election How the surge in border crossings bolstered Trump, put Biden on the defensive and exposed an outdated immigration system that no one likes.\n\nShare this article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe coils of barbed wire at the edge of Poncho Nevarez\u2019s ranch on the Rio Grande were meant as a deterrent. Instead, they just tore at the bodies and clothes of desperate migrants who clambered through to Eagle Pass, Texas.\n\nThe fence installed by the National Guard was, in Nevarez\u2019s view, both horribly barbaric and largely ineffective, like so much of the border-enforcement push that\u2019s popped up around his 500 acres\u2014the state police, the helicopters, the drones and river buoys.\n\n\u201cNone of this stuff solves the problem,\u201d said Nevarez, a former Democratic state lawmaker, as he stood next to a mound of discarded clothes, diapers and other detritus left behind by migrants on his land.\n\nPoncho Nevarez The belongings of migrants left behind on the property of Poncho Nevarez.\n\nImmigration has erupted into a defining issue of the 2024 ballot, with a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll finding it second only to the economy as voters\u2019 top concern. Courts are bogged down by unprecedented levels of cases\u2014federal agents encountered 10,000 people a day crossing the southern border in December\u2014and the tumult has exposed the US system as underfunded, opaque and bursting at the seams.\n\n\u201cThis is gonna decide who becomes the president, how it\u2019s handled,\u201d Nevarez said.\n\nDonald Trump has again made the border his signature issue as he seeks a return to the White House, telling agents they\u2019re \u201cin a war\u201d and sometimes borrowing rhetoric from White nationalist groups that warn about a \u201cpoisoning\u201d of the nation\u2019s blood.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has been put on the defensive, claiming his hands are tied without action from Congress to change laws. But it wasn\u2019t Trump who most effectively boxed in Biden over migrants in the first place. It was a fellow Republican, Texas Governor Greg Abbott.\n\nIn early 2022, with migration rebounding as pandemic restrictions faded, Abbott heard from Texas mayors, county judges and police chiefs about communities overrun with migrants dropped off by the Border Patrol.\n\n\u201cThey said they could not handle it anymore,\u201d Abbott said in an interview. \u201cI said I would help them out.\u201d\n\nSo Abbott and his aides came up with a plan\u2014which critics called politically motivated\u2014to bus migrants to Democratic \u201csanctuary cities.\u201d The first bus dropped migrants from Colombia, Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua near the Capitol. After that, others went to New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Denver and Los Angeles.\n\nA Texas Department of Public Safety helicopter spots migrants at the border. Barbed wire along the Rio Grande. The Firefly migrant processing center. Governor Abbott placed floating barriers in the Rio Grande to deter migrants from crossing into the state from Mexico.\n\nOther border hawks, including the governors of Florida and Arizona, followed suit with similar moves. As of early March, Texas had bused out more than 105,000 people.\n\n\u201cEvery state is now a border state, every town is now a border town,\u201d Trump said Tuesday during a campaign speech in Michigan.\n\nLeaving the migrants\u2014many poor, unauthorized to work and unprepared for cold winters\u2014on Democrats\u2019 doorsteps all of a sudden made it their problem to fix. City officials from New York and Chicago begged the Biden administration for help. With little aid forthcoming, even Democratic-led cities such as Denver ultimately paid to bus migrants to other destinations.\n\nIllinois Comptroller Susana Mendoza, a Democrat, criticized Abbott\u2019s busing as inhumane but said it worked to drive a wedge between local and federal officials. \u201cFrom a political perspective, you have to look at his move as his genius,\u201d she said.\n\nNew Migrants Made Up More Than 2% of People in Some Counties Number of migrants with new immigration court cases in 2023 Source: Department of Justice EOIR case data, released after FOIA requests by TRAC at Syracuse University\n\nThe buses also, paradoxically, appealed to some migrants as they arrived in Texas. While many arranged their own transportation to other parts of the country, others heard they could get a free ride, according to Valeria Wheeler, executive director of the Mission: Border Hope in Eagle Pass, which provides temporary shelter for migrants before they move on.\n\n\u201cRight when they enter our place, they\u2019re like, \u2018We want to go in the free buses,\u2019\u201d she said. They \u201chelp a lot of asylum seekers to move forward and go to their final destination or other places.\u201d\n\nValeria Wheeler\n\nWhere people try to enter the US is influenced by a number of factors such as cartel activity in Mexico, enforcement in the US, water levels in the Rio Grande and tips shared on social media. But one place stood out last year as a hot spot for crossings\u2014Eagle Pass, a city of 30,000 in Maverick County, previously best known outside Texas as a setting for Cormac McCarthy\u2019s novel No Country for Old Men.\n\nCity council member Monica Cruz, who is also a real estate agent, laments that the city is so strongly linked with illegal migration.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been dreaming of people knowing where Eagle Pass was,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want the wrong idea, or the bad attention.\u201d\n\nTexas police and National Guard troops take over a city park on the Rio Grande, surrounding it with barbed wire and shipping containers.\n\nAbbott responded to the surge by sending in state troopers and the National Guard, and they\u2019ve put on a show of force. A city park along the Rio Grande is surrounded by barbed wire and shipping containers. Troops in camouflage patrol the area with rifles. Helicopters and humvees are parked nearby.\n\nThe spectacle is part of Abbott\u2019s $11 billion Operation Lone Star border security initiative, which officials say has led to 500,000 apprehensions statewide and more than 40,000 criminal arrests.\n\nRead more: Texas Picks a Fight With Biden Over Powers at the Border\n\nThe crackdown is having an impact, according to Lieutenant Christopher Olivarez, a spokesman for the Department of Public Safety, who points out that arrivals in Eagle Pass fell to an average of a few hundred a day this year, from 2,000 at the end of last year. But he acknowledges that there\u2019s a whack-a-mole aspect to the effort, with more enforcement in one part of the border often pushing migrants a few miles downriver, or as far away as places like El Paso, Arizona or California.\n\nMigrants board a state sponsored bus to New York at Mission: Border Hope in Eagle Pass. Migrants are given a wristband and scanned before boarding a bus to New York. At Mission: Border Hope, signs in Spanish inform migrants of their location. An Ecuadorian family waits for the arrival of a Texas state-sponsored bus to New York.\n\n\u201cBy having these barriers, we\u2019re able to secure one area,\u201d he said. The goal \u201cis trying to prevent people from even stepping foot in that river.\u201d\n\nIn Washington, pressure to stem the tide of new arrivals has grown before November\u2019s vote. Biden\u2019s stance has hardened over the past few months, while Trump, who swept to the presidency in 2016 in part on a pledge to build a border wall, is now running his third campaign focused on immigration.\n\n\u201cThis is a Joe Biden invasion,\u201d Trump said while visiting Eagle Pass in February to shine a spotlight on the issue.\n\nTrump dealt with migration surges during his presidency too. There were about 850,000 southwest border \u201cencounters\u201d of migrants\u2014some are caught more than once\u2014in the 2019 fiscal year. That was almost twice as much as 2018. It has more than doubled since, with 2.5 million encounters in the 2023 fiscal year.\n\nMigrant encounters across the Mexican border hit a record in December, topping 300,000 for the first time, before falling to about 175,000 in January and 190,000 in February. They\u2019re typically lower in winter months and higher in the fall, right around the election.\n\nRepublicans have warned that bad actors can easily get in, and often try to link rising immigration to crime despite research that shows migrants are less likely to commit crimes than native-born citizens.\n\nBackpacks of migrants who were detained by law enforcement hang on the fence of a ranch owner near Eagle Pass.\n\nThe GOP has been particularly focused on the case of Laken Riley, a Georgia nursing student who police say was killed in February by a Venezuelan man who entered the country illegally but was released on parole.\n\nWhile most narcotics come into the country through official ports of entry, a porous border also makes it easier for drug smuggling. Texas border operations have seized 469 million lethal doses of fentanyl, according to the governor\u2019s office.\n\nMany migrants are also victims of crimes themselves, often extorted along their journey and frequently compelled to pay gangs for safe passage to the border.\n\nOlivarez said Texas enforcement is focused on illegal activity, though it\u2019s difficult to completely separate that from the broader issue of crossings. Gangs take advantage of diversions caused by migrants to smuggle drugs, money or weapons across.\n\n\u201cWhen you do have an influx of people coming across, it\u2019s gonna tie up every resource that we have along the border,\u201d he said. So the cartels will \u201cexploit more areas.\u201d\n\nLieutenant Christopher Olivarez of Texas Department of Public Safety.\n\nImmigration has exploded globally due to a confluence of factors, including the pandemic\u2019s economic fallout and political turmoil in countries such as Venezuela and Ecuador. The arrivals to the US once came overwhelmingly from Mexico and Central America, but now hail from all over the world. Analysts say the numbers have been boosted by a belief that it\u2019s now fairly easy to get across the US border and secure papers to start a tenuous new life while awaiting immigration court proceedings.\n\nThose migrants who turn themselves in to Border Patrol are mostly asylum seekers, and part of the challenge is evaluating who meets the criteria \u2013 standards Biden wants tightened. Sorting out claims is often a question of shades of gray of despair.\n\nAngel Feliz, 41, said he left the Dominican Republic in mid-February with his wife and 5-year-old son. After arriving in Mexico, they crossed the Rio Grande on March 9 and surrendered to US authorities in Eagle Pass. He said he made an appointment to request asylum and hoped to join relatives in Florida after a short stay at Mission: Border Hope.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m getting older and I don\u2019t want my son to have to do what I did, which was to work really hard for not much money,\u201d said the former parking attendant. \u201cWe think we can find a better future here, especially for our son.\u201d\n\nBiden began his presidency by proposing an immigration bill that called for a path to citizenship for young adults who were brought to the US as children. It also would have laid the groundwork for more legal immigration, as well as some border restrictions sought by Republicans. It went nowhere, just as efforts before it did.\n\nDuring his presidency, the powers to expel people have changed. Title 42, a pandemic-related health power that both Biden and Trump used widely to remove people, expired in May 2023. In the 11 months since, with border crossings at or near record levels, Biden has sent away 630,000 people, more than any pre-pandemic year under Trump.\n\nThe crisis led to frenzied talks among lawmakers in late 2023, ultimately yielding a bipartisan Senate deal. It was a breakthrough after years of false starts and included billions in new funding for enforcement.\n\nBut the bill swiftly collapsed under pressure from Trump, who said he didn\u2019t want to hand Biden a win in an election year. Biden is now campaigning on the idea that he had a plan to shore up the border, but was thwarted by Republicans.\n\n\u201cWe can fight about fixing the border, or we can fix it,\u201d he said in the State of the Union. \u201cSend me the border bill now.\u201d\n\nWooden crosses for a memorial held by the First United Methodist Church in Eagle Pass, representing each migrant life lost while crossing the US-Mexico border in 2023. The crosses marked with blue and pink represent migrant children who have died.\n\nThat tactic seemed to be effective for Tom Suozzi, who won a special election for a US House seat in suburban New York in February as he blamed the GOP for \u201cpolitical game-playing.\u201d\n\nBut immigration advocates have warned that Biden\u2019s sudden willingness to enact harsher border measures\u2014while designed to address a political weakness\u2014could cost him votes, too.\n\nCruz, the Eagle Pass city council member, says the border region needs sustained help, not political grandstanding. She\u2019s sick of national politicians coming to Eagle Pass to make speeches, but not actually helping.\n\n\u201cThey come take a picture and they leave,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a humanitarian crisis\u2014I mean, there\u2019s no other way to explain it.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s hopeful that the crisis will eventually lead to an overhaul in US immigration laws that will bring things under control. \u201cI honestly and truly believe that it\u2019s an open door to change things that haven\u2019t been changed for years,\u201d she said.\n\nNevarez, the ranch owner, knows all about the politics. A former Democratic lawmaker in the Texas House who is now sober after being caught with cocaine in 2019, he\u2019s dismayed by hardline Republican tactics and disillusioned by his own party\u2019s inability to offer an alternative.\n\nOn March 19, National Guard troops returned to his ranch and, at his request, cut away the barbed wire.\n\n\n\nMore On Bloomberg",

Because this election year is about so much more than the presidential race between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. It\u2019s about abortion, climate change, LGBTQ+ rights, student debt, and the future of the Supreme Court. It\u2019s about local contests and the importance of not just voting, but organizing. Care about state censorship in schools and book ban laws? Follow our education coverage for all the latest news on that beat. Concerned about the wave of legislation targeting LGBTQ young people? Read our stories about how students are mobilizing against bathroom bills, bans on trans athletes and even moving away from home states in search of healthcare and safety.\n\nTo get you up to speed, we have the basics, like guides on how to vote for the first time. Our 2024 student election correspondents are sharing on-the-ground stories from some of the states that matter most for determining control of Congress and the White House (Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, and Michigan). And you can check out the latest election news and takes from our columnists, too.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re feeling burned out by all of the 2024 election coverage, we understand. Our identity section has valuable resources on taking care of your mental health, including how to make your relationship with social media healthier and how to find a good therapist you can actually afford. Our Overlooked History series looks at the activists and events that shaped contemporary history, while explainers on Congress\u2019 attempted TikTok ban and the organization that\u2019s helped elect so many conservatives to the Supreme Court can provide helpful context about why our country looks the way it does.\n\nWhatever you\u2019re looking for, we\u2019ve got it. And remember to take care of yourself in what will likely be a wild year in U.S. politics. Your Teen Vogue editors will be in it with you!",

        "text": "2024 Senegalese presidential election\nPresidential elections were held in Senegal on 24 March 2024. Incumbent president Macky Sall was ineligible to pursue a third term due to term limits in the Constitution of Senegal.[1]\n\nThe elections were originally scheduled for 25 February,[2][3] but were postponed indefinitely by a decree of Sall on 3 February,[4] and then delayed by the National Assembly to 15 December. However, on 15 February the Senegalese Constitutional Council overturned the postponement and ordered elections to proceed as soon as possible,[5] with the government subsequently setting a new election date for 24 March after a national dialogue at the end of February was ruled unconstitutional.[6][7]\n\nBassirou Diomaye Faye, running in place of Ousmane Sonko, was elected president with 54% of the vote, while Amadou Ba, the candidate of the ruling United in Hope (BBY) coalition, peacefully conceded defeat.[8] Faye's victory was later confirmed by Senegal's Supreme Court.[9] He was inaugurated as president on 2 April.\n\nBackground [ edit ]\n\nSeveral parties had announced their intent to run for office in 2024, but they first had to receive sufficient support from the general public to pass the sponsorship stage. Any presidential candidate must receive between 0.8 percent and 1 percent of the electorate's signatures. These signatures must be collected with at least 2,000 sponsorships in each of the seven of Senegal's fourteen regions.[3] Candidates can also have the option of receiving sponsorships from at least 13 members of the National Assembly, or 120 mayors and heads of regional councils. A deposit of 30 million CFA francs must also be paid by candidates at the Caisse des d\u00e9p\u00f4ts et consignations.[11]\n\nOn 17 February 2023, the day before the date was revealed for the upcoming elections, Senegalese opposition candidate Ousmane Sonko was forcibly taken from his vehicle amid rallies outside a Dakar courthouse where his trial was taking place. Sonko was in court as part of a civil lawsuit against him by Senegal's tourism minister for defamation and public insults.[12]\n\nOn 3 July, following a series of protests regarding Sonko's conviction for \"immoral behaviour\" in a separate case, incumbent president Macky Sall stated that he would not seek re-election for a third term.[13][14]\n\nRegistrations for candidacy opened in October 2023 and ended on 26 December 2023. Pre-campaigning began on 5 January 2024 while the campaign period was set to start on 4 February, with the first round taking place on 25 February.[11]\n\nOn 14 July, Ousmane Sonko was announced as the presidential candidate for PASTEF. Sonko's eligibility as a candidate was unclear due to him receiving a two-year prison sentence in June 2023, rendering him ineligible to run according to some legal experts; although it was noted he had not exhausted his appeals to the Supreme Court, which could reverse his sentence.[15] On 31 July, PASTEF was ordered dissolved by the Senegalese government,[16] while Sonko undertook a months-long hunger strike in protest over the political situation.[17]\n\nIn September, Sall nominated Prime Minister Amadou Ba as candidate for the ruling Alliance for the Republic.[18]\n\nOn 19 November, PASTEF designated its secretary-general Bassirou Diomaye Faye as their candidate for the election.[19] Faye had been imprisoned since April 2023, when he was arrested for criticising the conduct of Sonko's defamation trial on social media.[20] In December, a court ordered Sonko's reinstatement to the voters' list and allowed him to file his candidacy.[21]\n\nA total of 93 people registered to run for president before the Senegalese Constitutional Council. The list of candidates was narrowed down as the body examined the sponsorship of would-be candidates until 10 January 2024 before moving on to scrutinize other relevant documents. Many candidates were rejected due to missing documents, insufficient sponsors or sponsors supporting more than one candidate, including former prime ministers Aminata Toure and Cheikh Hadjibou Soumar\u00e9, as well as Macky Sall's brother-in-law Adama Faye. This prompted Toure and 27 other candidates to collectively criticise the sponsorship control system.\n\nIn January 2024, candidate Thierno Alassane Sall filed a complaint against fellow candidate Karim Wade being of dual French-Senegalese nationality.[22] Wade, a former minister and the son of former president Abdoulaye Wade, subsequently renounced his French citizenship.[23] At the same time, the National Assembly created a commission of inquiry responsible for monitoring the electoral process.[24]\n\nOn 20 January, the Senegalese Constitutional Council published the final list of candidates for the presidential election. It was made up of 20 candidates including Amadou Ba, former prime ministers Idrissa Seck and Mahammed Boun Abdallah Dionne, former interior minister Aly Ngouille Ndiaye, the former mayor of Dakar Khalifa Sall, the mayor of Kolda, Mame Boye Diao, and Bassirou Diomaye Faye, who was in prison pending a trial.[25][26][27] Two women were also cleared to run, namely gynaecologist Rose Wardini and entrepreneur Anta Babacar Ngom,[28] the head of one of the country's largest food manufacturers and poultry firms, Sedima.[29][30] Both are the first women to run for president since 2012.[31]\n\nThe candidacies of Ousmane Sonko and Karim Wade were not validated, with the council citing Sonko's six-month suspended sentence for defamation that was upheld by the Senegalese Supreme Court on 4 January and Wade's renunciation of his French citizenship being \"not retroactive\" and his sworn declaration of the renunciation being \"inexact\".[32] Wade's exclusion prompted the 25 MPs of his Senegalese Democratic Party to call for an inquiry in the National Assembly over Wade's and other candidates' exclusion,[28] which lasted until 18 February, when it was ended by the Senegalese government, citing the opening of a judicial investigation over the matter.[33]\n\nOn 28 January, Sonko released a video on social media formally recognizing Bassirou Diomaye Faye as his replacement in the election.[34]\n\nOn 19 February, Rose Wardini renounced her candidacy following controversy over her dual Franco-Senegalese nationality.[35]\n\nPostponement [ edit ]\n\nOn 3 February, hours before campaigning was about to start, President Macky Sall ordered the indefinite postponement of the election, citing a parliamentary investigation into two judges of the Constitutional Court over their integrity with regards to the electoral process that was launched following Karim Wade's exclusion from the elections and warning of adverse effects on the \"credibility of the election by creating the seeds of pre- and post-electoral litigation\". Sall also claimed that some of the official candidates held dual citizenship. This was the first postponement of a presidential election in the country's history.[4][36]\n\nThe postponement was welcomed by Wade's Democratic Party, which requested the postponement, while candidates Thierno Alassane Sall, who called the postponement \"high treason,\"[37] Khalifa Sall and D\u00e9thi\u00e9 Fall announced that they would start their campaign as originally scheduled,[38] while candidate Habib Sy said that all opposition candidates had agreed to launch their campaigns together as scheduled.[39] Rejected candidate Aminata Tour\u00e9 called the decision \"sabotage\".[36] Abdou Latif Coulibaly, the Secretary General of Sall's government and its concurrent spokesman, announced his resignation, saying that he wanted to have \"full and complete freedom\" to defend his political convictions.[40]\n\nOn 4 February, police in Dakar fired tear gas to disperse demonstrators protesting against the postponement and arrested Aminata Tour\u00e9 and candidate Anta Babacar Ngom,[41] who had attended one of the rallies after all 19 opposition candidates called for supporters to gather in the streets, including at a major roundabout and in front of the National Assembly. Authorities also suspended and later revoked the broadcasting license of the private television channel Walf TV for its coverage of the protests, calling it an \"incitement to violence\".[42][43][44] Protesters were seen chanting \"Macky Sall, dictator!\" and establishing makeshift barricades, burning tyres[39] and throwing rocks at police.[37] The Ministry of Communication, Telecommunications and Digital Economy shut off mobile internet access on 5 February, citing \"the dissemination of several hateful and subversive messages relayed on social networks in the context of threats and disturbances to public order.\"[45] Three people were killed during protests against the postponement in Saint-Louis, Dakar and Ziguinchor.[46] Protests were also held in Diourbel.[47]\n\nIn a heated session on 5 February that saw some opposition deputies removed by security forces after they tried to block proceedings, the National Assembly voted in favor of a proposal to postpone the elections until 15 December formally. The measure, which needed the support of at least three-fifths (99) of the chamber's 165 deputies to pass, was approved by 105 members and rejected by only one MP and prompted renewed protests outside the National Assembly that were suppressed by police using tear gas. Two opposition parties subsequently filed an appeal to the Constitutional Council urging it to direct \"the continuation of the electoral process.\"[42][48][49] Fourteen opposition candidates also filed an appeal to the council,[50] with two others pledging to challenge the postponement in court.[51] Three lawmakers who were affiliated with PASTEF were briefly arrested on 6 February.[52]\n\nIn response to the postponement and subsequent protests, former presidents Abdou Diouf and Abdoulaye Wade called on Macky Sall to organise the \"national dialogue he has announced, without delay.\" They also called on protesters to \"immediately end the violence.\"[53]\n\nInternational reactions [ edit ]\n\nThe French foreign ministry called on Senegalese authorities \"to end the uncertainty about the electoral calendar so the vote can be held as soon as possible.\"[40] The US State Department also urged \"all participants in (the) electoral process to engage peacefully to swiftly set a new date and the conditions for a timely, free and fair election\".[54] US Senate Foreign Relations Committee chair Ben Cardin said the postponement put Senegal \"on a dangerous path towards dictatorship, and must not be allowed to stand.\"[55]\n\nECOWAS called on authorities to \"expedite the various processes to set a new date for the elections\",[54] while African Union commission chair Moussa Faki Mahamat urged a resolution of the political crisis \"through consultation, understanding and dialogue\" and called on authorities to \"organise the elections as quickly as possible, in transparency, in peace and national harmony\".[43] The European Union also said the postponement had opened a \"period of uncertainty\" and called \"for the staging of a transparent, inclusive and credible election as soon as possible.\"[40] United Nations Human Rights Office spokesperson Liz Throssell said any decision to postpone the elections should be \"based on broad-based consultations.\"[55] On 8 February, foreign ministers of ECOWAS member states held an emergency session in Abuja, Nigeria, to discuss the situation in Senegal.[56] On 12 February, an ECOWAS delegation arrived in the country to attempt to help mediate.[57]\n\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists condemned the Senegalese government's shutdown of Walf TV.[41]\n\nOverturning of postponement and resumption of elections [ edit ]\n\nOn 15 February, the Senegalese Constitutional Council ruled that the decision to postpone and reschedule the election by Macky Sall and the National Assembly was \"contrary to the constitution\" and ordered its cancellation.[58] However, it also acknowledged that holding the election as originally scheduled on 25 February was no longer feasible, and urged the government to act immediately. In response, presidential spokesperson Yoro Dia said that Sall would comply with the decision, but did not give a new date for it to be held.[5] In a televised interview on 22 February, Sall said that he would leave office as scheduled on 2 April, but said that he would hold talks first with political leaders to determine a new timetable for the elections.[59] He also expressed his willingness to release Ousmane Sonko and his supporters as an act of good faith.[60] His proposal for a dialogue was rejected on 23 February by the Aar Sunu Election (Protect Our Election) collective composed of 40 civil society groups, which called it \"unacceptable\" and an \"attempt at diversion\".[61]\n\nDuring the week that the postponement was overturned, several hundred political prisoners were released by the government.[62] At a protest in Dakar on 17 February, opposition candidate Malick Gakou [fr] called for the election to be held in March to ensure the departure of Macky Sall from the presidency as previously scheduled on 2 April.[63] A total of 15 candidates have called for elections to be held before 2 April.[64] On the original date of the elections on 25 February, candidates held a mock vote with them slipping ballot papers into a box bearing the words \"RIP 25 February.\"[65] In the end of February, the government tabled an amnesty bill to calm the social and political climate.[66]\n\nDuring a national dialogue in Diamniadio that was boycotted by the opposition and was attended only by Amadou Ba and another candidate on 26 February, Macky Sall announced that elections would be held before the start of the rainy season in July, and reiterated his commitment to leave office as scheduled in April. In response, Aar Sunu Election, which also boycotted the proceedings, called for a general strike on 27 February.[67][66] On the second and final day of the national dialogue on 27 February, a panel composed of civil, political and religious leaders proposed holding the presidential elections on 2 June, and recommended a review of the disqualification of Karim Wade and other presidential candidates.[68]\n\nOn 6 March, the government set the first round of the elections on 24 March after the constitutional court ruled the national dialogue was unconstitutional.[7] Macky Sall dismissed Amadou Ba as prime minister to allow him to focus on his election campaign and replaced him with Interior Minister Sidiki Kaba.[69] The Constitutional Council approved of the new date on 7 March.[70] On 14 March, days before the election, Sonko and Faye were released from prison, following the passage of the amnesty bill, granting them a few days of campaigning.[71]\n\nIn an interview with the BBC on 20 March, Macky Sall rejected responsibility for the political crisis caused by his decision to postpone the election, saying \"I don't owe any apology, I abided by the law\".[72]\n\nCampaign [ edit ]\n\nCampaigning began on 9 March and ended on 22 March, but was complicated by it occurring during Ramadan, during which many activities were shut down for the day.[30][73] This forced some candidates to resort to online strategies.[74]\n\nThe election took place amid several socioeconomic affecting Senegal, such as high unemployment among the youth, increases in the cost of living, and questions over the management of domestic oil and gas production which is expected to begin in 2024.[75]\n\nBassirou Diomaye Faye campaigned on creating jobs, taking a strong stance against corruption, and vowing to reexamine energy contracts.[76] He ran under the slogan \"Diomaye mooy Ousmane\", which means \"Diomaye is Ousmane\" in Wolof, and expressed hope that Sonko's charisma and popular appeal amongst Senegal's youth would boost his campaign.[77] Faye's program is similar with Sonko's for 2019.[78] Faye announced his intentions to implement a monetary reform to finance the economy of Senegal, removing the CFA franc as the country's currency. In his program, he states that he would \"carry out a monetary reform that will allow our country to have its own currency\", however he added that \u201cthe creation of a currency requires the respect of the stages of the process\u201d.[79] He added in a press conference that he believed that there was \"no sovereignty if there is no monetary sovereignty.\"[80] After concern from foreign investors, in March he said that he would implement \"monetary reform at the sub-regional level first\", before considering to create a national currency.[80] He also supported extending the fishing zone exclusive for local fishermen by 20 kilometers to offset losses from foreign fishing fleets.[81] During the campaign, Faye released a declaration of his assets and called on other candidates to follow suit.[82]\n\nAmadou Ba said that he sought to represent continuity and stability. He vowed to continue the legacy of Macky Sall with a positive investment climate and said that a vote for him was a vote for \"greater peace and prosperity\". He criticized Faye and Sonko saying their proposals were radical and labeled them as \"bandits\"'. He argued his ministerial track record proved he would oversee development and create one million jobs in five years.[74]\n\nKhalifa Sall ran on a platform of sustainable development, particularly on responsible water management and equitable land distribution.[29] Mahammed Boun Abdallah Dionne ran on a platform focusing on Senegal's \"economic sovereignty\".[29] However, Dionne fell ill during the campaign and was hospitalized in Paris, where he later died on 5 April.[83] Anta Babacar Ngom meanwhile called for the strengthening of the private sector, free healthcare and reformation of the education system, including increased recognition for indigenous languages.[29]\n\nOn 15 March, a day after Faye's release from jail, he gathered hundreds of supporters at his first public appearance as a presidential contender.[84] Former president Abdoulaye Wade and his Senegalese Democratic Party (PDS) endorsed Faye on the same day, following the disqualification of his son Karim Wade.[85] Cheikh Tidiane Dieye, another candidate in the presidential election, withdrew in favor of Faye.[86] Former prime minister Aminata Tour\u00e9, who had a public falling out with Macky Sall and left the ruling coalition in 2023, also backed Faye.[84]\n\nConduct [ edit ]\n\nOn 23 March, the electoral observation mission of the Economic Community of Central African States (CEMAC) called for an \"inclusive and incident-free presidential vote\".[87]\n\nFive hundred observers were stationed at polling offices around the country and another 500 traveled between sites to monitor the vote. Their mission was to make sure voting opens on time and whether candidates were present at the count, as well as watching for any interference or irregularities. A coalition of Senegalese civil society groups, known collectively as Cosce, was also involved in the observation mission.[88]\n\nShortly after polling closed, a visiting government delegation in Saint-Louis was pelted with stones after entering a closed polling station.[89]\n\nMalin Bj\u00f6rk, who headed a group of 100 observers from the European Union that monitored 40 polling stations across the country, said that the vote \"took place in a calm environment and was well-organized.\"[90]\n\nAn ECOWAS monitoring team sent to the country said that the election was conducted \"smoothly\".[91]\n\nResults [ edit ]\n\nReactions [ edit ]\n\nDomestic [ edit ]\n\nOfficial results were released and validated by the constitutional court on 29 March,[93] but even before the preliminary results of the first round were released on 26 March,[94] at least seven candidates, including Anta Babacar Ngom and D\u00e9thi\u00e9 Fall, had already conceded defeat to Bassirou Diomaye Faye.[95] This came after the first set of tallies announced showed Faye had won the majority of votes in the first round, triggering widespread street celebrations in Dakar.[96] Hours later, the ruling party's candidate, Amadou Ba, conceded defeat with congratulations to Faye. Reacting to his victory, Faye pledged to \"govern with humility and transparency, and to fight corruption at all levels\", and to devote himself to \"rebuilding our institutions\".[97]\n\nOutgoing president Macky Sall also congratulated Faye, hailing \"a victory for Senegalese democracy\".[98][99]\n\nFaye's victory is the first instance that an opposition candidate won an election in the first round since Senegal's independence in 1960.[93] Faye was officially inaugurated as president on 2 April.[100]\n\nThe annual Independence Day parade in Dakar on 4 April was cancelled, with authorities citing the uncertainty caused by the election campaign.[101]\n\nInternational [ edit ]\n\nSee also [ edit ]",

In New York, Joe Biden won on the Democratic side and Donald Trump was victorious on the Republican side.\n\nBoth easily won in Connecticut, as well.\n\nFor New York election results, please click here\n\nFor Connecticut election results, please click here\n\nThe candidates are clearly looking to the general election and targeting issues important to women.\n\n\"You know, the suburban housewives actually like Donald Trump. You know why? Because I'm the one that's going to keep them safe. They like to say, well, the suburban housewives, I don't know. I think I do great with the suburban housewives,\" Trump said.\n\nThe Biden campaign was focused Tuesday on abortion, launching a commercial one day after Florida's Supreme Court cleared the way for a six-week abortion ban to go into effect in the state next month.\n\n\"I'm running to make Rowe v. Wade the law of the land again so women have a federal guarantee of the right to choose. Donald Trump doesn't trust women. I do,\" Biden says on the ad.\n\nIn Connecticut, Democrats could vote \"Uncommitted\" to oppose the president's handling of the Israel-Hamas war. New Yorkers didn't have that option, but activists who wanted to send the president a message urged people to \"Leave it blank.\"\n\nWe won't know how many left them blank until the vote is certified in a couple of weeks.",

        "text": "Legal experts assess the impact of this super election year on the art market\nTaxation and Import VAT\n\nIn 2024, general elections will take place in the US, India, and the UK, and there will be EU-wide elections for the European Parliament. In election years, taxation is usually at the top of the political agenda. Often, tax considerations affecting the art market are formulated with zero-sum calculations in mind. One country\u2019s gain by way of an advantageous tax regime will result in another country\u2019s loss.\n\nEU Directive 2022/542 aims to create closer alignment of Member States\u2019 VAT regimes. Previously, it was only possible for Member States to apply a reduced VAT rate on imported works of art, collectors\u2019 items, and antiques, and works sold by artists themselves. Following the implementation of the directive, these objects can benefit from reduced VAT rates at the point of sale in their local primary and secondary markets and when purchased by museums. EU Member States first must each transpose the amendments and apply the new measures by January 1, 2025.\n\nHowever, the directive does not allow for the cumulative application of the reduced VAT rate on artwork imports in conjunction with the application of the margin scheme when selling the artwork. In other words, pursuant to the provisions, it will not be possible for a dealer first to benefit from the reduced VAT rate upon importation into the EU and then, upon onward sale, benefit from being taxed on the margin between purchase price and onward-sale price only.\n\nImplementing the directive, France could have chosen to maintain the 20% rate on profit margins for secondary sales, but would have had to extend that rate to imports and primary sales of art. To the relief of many French art market participants, French lawmakers opted instead to legislate not only to continue to offer a reduced rate at 5.5% for imported artworks, but also to extend the reduced rate to the vast majority of VAT-able transactions of artworks in France which are set to be taxed at 5.5% from 2025 onwards. This amendment may be seen as an attempt to consolidate France\u2019s position as the continent\u2019s leading international art market further.",

Over its nearly four-hundred-year history, the guard has transformed from a loose collection of colonial militias into a well-trained and equipped force that often serves side by side with active-duty military personnel.\n\nThe guard is also distinctive in that it serves under both state and federal command. It has been called upon in recent years to respond to many domestic events, including natural disasters, the COVID-19 pandemic, anti-racism protests, and border security challenges. As its domestic role has grown, the guard has also become more integral to international U.S. military operations. The Air National Guard in particular carries out critical military intelligence analysis, including in Ukraine and the Middle East.\n\nWhat is the National Guard?\n\nThe National Guard is unique among the U.S. armed forces in that it can perform state and federal functions. The guard is generally called up to respond to state-level emergencies, such as natural disasters. But, unlike most of the other military forces, it can also serve a domestic law enforcement role. Additionally, the president can deploy the guard to serve missions overseas, which has happened more frequently in recent years, including to Afghanistan, Iraq, Poland, and the Horn of Africa.\n\nDaily News Brief A summary of global news developments with CFR analysis delivered to your inbox each morning.

It consists of two parts: the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard, which are both considered U.S. military reserve components but are distinct from the army and air force reserves. The guard is overseen at the federal level by the National Guard Bureau, the head of which is a four-star general and member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the military\u2019s top advisory body.\n\nAs of fiscal year 2022, there were 434,689 guard members [PDF] in total, serving in fifty-four separate organizations across the fifty states; Washington, DC; and three U.S. territories: Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.\n\nMany members of the National Guard serve part-time while holding civilian jobs or attending school. Guard members commit to one weekend of training per month plus a minimum of a few weeks of service per year. Most members serve in the states in which they live.\n\nHow did the Guard come about?\n\nThe National Guard traces its origins to the militias established by the American colonies. These militias grew out of the English tradition of organizing citizen-soldiers to provide for the common defense. The guard\u2019s birthday is December 13, 1636, when the Massachusetts Bay Colony created the colonies\u2019 first militia regiments. The state militias were preserved after the founding of the United States, reflecting the balance sought by the Constitution between state and federal authorities.\n\nHowever, it wasn\u2019t until the early twentieth century, particularly after the passage of the 1903 Militia Act, and continuing through both World Wars, that the guard was transformed from a loosely organized network of militias into the well-equipped and regimented force it remains today. It was also during this period that the state-federal relationship became more defined.\n\nWho controls it?\n\nMost of the time, state National Guards are activated and commanded by the governors of their respective states or territories, but presidents (with input from top officials) can federalize the guard in certain cases. (The DC National Guard is solely under federal control.) For instance, presidents have called units into federal service to respond to extreme weather events such as hurricanes and wildfires, bolster border security, and assist U.S. military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Unlike state missions, which generally last less than three months, federal deployments tend to last at least a year. On international missions, the guard is often trained and commanded by active-duty military personnel, and their duties can be identical to their active-duty counterparts; however, hiring and other administrative tasks typically remain managed by state guard units. The National Guard can also be federalized but kept under state control, with the federal government paying for the deployment. (Statewide operations are normally funded by the state.) This was done in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in many states.\n\nPresidents rarely federalize a state or territory\u2019s guard without the consent of the governor. In the wake of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, President George W. Bush declined to take control of Louisiana\u2019s National Guard due to the objection of Governor Kathleen Blanco. Governors have at times requested that the federal government assume control over their guard units, as California Governor Pete Wilson did during the 1992 Los Angeles riots.\n\nWhere does the National Guard deploy?\n\nThe National Guard fulfills a range of duties, including:\n\nDisaster relief. The guard is frequently called up to respond to statewide emergencies, such as natural disasters. For example, more than one hundred thousand National Guard members were deployed to combat wildfires across nineteen states in 2022. The guard also prepares every year for the hurricanes that routinely strike the southeastern United States. In 2019, the guard responded to sixty-three natural disasters, including seven hurricanes or tropical storms, nineteen floods, and twelve fires. In 2023, members of the Hawaii Army National Guard were mobilized to support disaster response efforts after a massive wildfire on the island of Maui, Hawaii, including by ensuring public order and engaging in search and recovery missions.\n\nMilitary support. The National Guard plays a crucial role in supporting U.S. military operations [PDF] abroad. Since 9/11, more than one million National Guard members have deployed to theaters including Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as countries in Europe and the Pacific. Most recently, the National Guard has helped collect and analyze intelligence related to Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and assisted in training members of Ukraine\u2019s armed forces. Members of the guard have fought in nearly every U.S. conflict since the Revolutionary War, and more than twenty thousand are deployed around the world on any given day.\n\nThe Air National Guard in particular has played a growing role in military operations, especially in drone operations and data analysis. At some air force bases within the United States, members of the Air National Guard serve alongside active-duty personnel.\n\nLaw enforcement. The guard can be deployed by state governors for law enforcement purposes. Many states activated their National Guards in response to historic anti-racism protests across the United States after Minneapolis police killed George Floyd in May 2020. In January 2021, the DC National Guard was deployed in response to an assault on the U.S. Capitol by a mob backing President Donald Trump while lawmakers were meeting to certify the presidential election. The guard was later quartered inside the Capitol building, evoking comparisons to the Civil War. In March 2024, in response to a surge in subway crime, New York Governor Kathy Hochul dispatched several hundred guard members to help police monitor the city\u2019s busiest stations.\n\nBorder Security. The National Guard is part of the complex multiagency border security apparatus. As of May 2023, there were around 2,500 National Guard troops deployed to the U.S.-Mexico border. Some of these troops are on federal missions, directed by the president; others are run by states. At times, non-border states such as Florida and South Dakota have sent their own National Guards to the border. These troops primarily serve in an administrative capacity, with a directive against performing \u201claw enforcement functions.\u201d\n\nElection support. The guard has provided cybersecurity support in recent years to state and local governments administering elections, including the 2020 presidential contest. Due to the pandemic, guard members performed additional election-related duties, including staffing polling places in some states (though in plain clothes to avoid the perception of military involvement in the political process).\n\nState partnerships. The guard\u2019s State Partnership Program (SPP) aims to increase state military-to-military relationships as a critical U.S. security cooperation tool. Administered by the National Guard Bureau, the SPP boasts partnerships with one hundred partner countries around the world. For example, the California Air National Guard\u2019s partnership with Ukraine proved pivotal during the early stages of Russia\u2019s invasion.\n\nWhat controversies have there been over the Guard?\n\nIn a few instances, presidents and governors have clashed over the military\u2019s domestic law enforcement role, particularly during periods of civil unrest. While governors can call on guard members to serve as temporary law enforcers, presidents cannot do so under normal circumstances. The Posse Comitatus Act generally prohibits the president from using the military in this role. However, presidents can circumvent this law by invoking the Insurrection Act. For example, President Dwight D. Eisenhower used the law to federalize the Arkansas National Guard to enforce desegregation of the state\u2019s schools following the governor\u2019s refusal to comply with the Supreme Court\u2019s Brown v. Board of Education decision. President John F. Kennedy did the same in Alabama and Mississippi.\n\nDebate over the domestic use of the military flared once again in 2020 amid nationwide anti-racism protests sparked by Floyd\u2019s death. President Trump threatened to deploy the military to quell civil unrest in parts of the country, and some Republican lawmakers urged him to do so using the Insurrection Act. Instead, he asked governors to send their National Guard troops to Washington, DC, to aid the federal response there, which was widely criticized as heavy-handed and legally murky. Trump also drew criticism for sending federal agents to several U.S. cities during the protests, including Portland, Oregon. Some Democratic lawmakers have suggested changing the law to prevent such an action.\n\nBy contrast, the response to rioters\u2019 breach of the Capitol in January 2021 was criticized as slow and insufficient. Because Washington, DC, is not a state, the president or Pentagon must give the order for a guard deployment there. Then Acting Defense Secretary Christopher C. Miller ultimately deployed more than one thousand guard members, but some analysts questioned why they had not been positioned near the Capitol preemptively. Tens of thousands of additional guard troops were mobilized in the days following the attack to ensure a peaceful transition of power.\n\nMeanwhile, at the border, National Guard deployments have been criticized for lacking the jurisdiction to implement U.S. immigration policy. Critics say poor working conditions for state deployments, including Texas\u2019s so-called Operation Lone Star, have rendered them particularly ineffective. Others say such deployments are necessary to fill gaps in border patrol.\n\nIn April 2023, the Air National Guard\u2019s expansive role in the military\u2019s foreign surveillance and intelligence operations drew intense scrutiny after the FBI arrested a twenty-one-year-old guardsman for leaking highly classified documents. The disclosures contained top-secret information on the war in Ukraine and internal communications of U.S. partners Israel and South Korea.

        "text": "The 2024 US Election Is Already Being Fought in the Courts (1)\nFor the 2024 election, Arizona officials didn\u2019t want a repeat of two years ago, when masked and armed people intimidated voters. So the state barred groups from monitoring drop boxes and polling locations.\n\nImmediately, conservative groups filed lawsuits in the Democratic-led swing state, arguing the change violated free speech rights.\n\nPolitical groups \u2014 some backed by anonymous donors \u2014 are launching so many lawsuits over voting rules this year, observers expect that they could approach the record set during the rancorous 2020 election amid Covid and bogus claims of fraud. The Democratic and Republican parties collectively have raised about $41.3 million to spend on such court fights since last year. And nonprofits, including some so-called dark money groups, have likely raised as much as hundreds of millions more.\n\nArmed individuals dressed in tactical gear at a ballot drop box in Mesa, Arizona in October 2022.\n\n\u201cVoters deserve to know they have a system where it\u2019s easy to vote and hard to cheat,\u201d said Scot Mussi, president of the Arizona Free Enterprise Club , which is suing to strike down Arizona\u2019s new rules including those barring the monitoring of polls and drop boxes by outside groups.\n\nAfter the last presidential election, which Donald Trump falsely claimed he won, spurring some of his supporters to riot in the US Capitol, states enacted a number of measures to improve voting procedures and reduce the risk of interference, such as extended polling hours.\n\nNever miss an episode. Follow the\n\nBig Take\n\npodcast on\n\niHeart\n\n,\n\nApple Podcasts\n\n,\n\nSpotify\n\nor wherever you listen.\n\nRead the transcript\n\n.\n\nWith Trump now headed for a rematch with President Joe Biden , political groups are challenging and defending these moves as well as plumbing for legal minutiae, pushing the courts to the center of the election process. Indeed, the US Supreme Court in March rejected a Colorado effort to boot Trump off the ballot.\n\nWhile some lawsuits attempt to address legitimate concerns, others serve as political strategies, said Martha Kropf, a professor of political science at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.\n\n\u201cClose elections mean you\u2019re going to fight to get every extra vote you can,\u201d she said.\n\nWith the presidential race poised to come down to seven pivotal states , Arizona, Michigan and Pennsylvania are already heated battlegrounds for litigation. Judges, not voters, may determine the election results, fear some experts and activists.\n\nArizona, which is also home to a tight US Senate race, hopes to head off the conspiracy theories that sprung up four years ago. Democratic officials said widespread voter intimidation could result if the Arizona Free Enterprise Club\u2019s most recent lawsuit prevails.\n\nAs is the case with other court fights across the country, the limited-government advocacy group works with influential partners, including America First Legal, led by former Trump White House adviser Stephen Miller , and Restoring Integrity and Trust in Elections, a nonprofit backed by Trump allies including billionaire Steve Wynn .\n\nRepublican supporters stand outside the Maricopa County Recorder\u2019s Office to protest the 2022 election in Phoenix, Arizona. Photographer: Alberto Mariani/AP\n\nSuch partnerships lead to more influence. As it takes on more cases, Mussi\u2019s group has seen its revenue jump three times to over $3.4 million in 2022 from the year before, showing how it has quickly become a power player in Arizona.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of good work being done on the conservative side of the spectrum these days to defend elections,\u201d said Derek Lyons , a former Trump adviser who now leads Restoring Integrity and Trust in Elections, which has funded and supported more than 30 cases in 17 states.\n\nProminent Democratic lawyer Marc Elias characterized some of these newly formed ventures as \u201cvigilante.\u201d He and his firm are filing dozens of lawsuits against voting restrictions across the country, often partnering with grassroots groups in swing states.\n\n\u201cNew Republican election vigilante groups are emerging to launch mass voter challenges against unsuspecting voters,\u201d Elias said in a social media post this week.\n\nTwitter: Marc E. Elias on Twitter / X\n\nIndeed, fighting battles over election rules big to arcane is a booming business for such groups and lawyers. Political parties\u2019 legal expenses have skyrocketed to $154 million in 2022 from around $5 million in 2003, according to data compiled by Derek Muller , a law professor at the University of Notre Dame. And nonprofits, including charitable organizations and dark-money advocacy groups, are increasingly filing and financing election-related lawsuits. They\u2019re not legally required to identify their backers.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot of organizations that don\u2019t have to disclose their donors, they don\u2019t have to disclose how they\u2019re spending their money,\u201d said Muller. \u201cThere\u2019s an effort to influence elections through the litigation process without the same transparency we see over on the campaign side.\u201d\n\nChallenging every aspect of the electoral process as a political tool started in earnest after the Supreme Court effectively decided the 2000 presidential contest in favor of George W. Bush over Al Gore in Florida\u2019s recount fight. Election litigation has since tripled, according to research by Rick Hasen , a professor of law and political science at University of California, Los Angeles. Lawsuits span disputes about signatures on absentee ballots to all manners of allegations of illegality.\n\nDuring the 2020 election, public health issues surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic, in addition to the unfounded claims of fraud perpetuated by Trump and his allies, led to a record number of election lawsuits.\n\nCongress played a role in the increase, too: In 2014, it allowed donors to bankroll parties\u2019 legal expenses. The contributions, which currently can be made in amounts up to $123,600, give the parties ample funding to fight in court.\n\nGroups aligned with Democrats say they\u2019re trying to stop voter suppression. Most lawsuits from Republican-leaning allies are aimed at creating more election oversight, including voter identification rules and tighter restrictions on who can vote.\n\nUnsettled Pennsylvania\n\nPennsylvania has the most unsettled questions around its electoral procedures, according to Muller, and both sides of the ideological divide have launched legal challenges since January alone.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania, for one, challenged York County\u2019s restrictions on nonpartisan election observers. And Voter Reference Foundation, a group with ties to GOP megadonor and billionaire Richard Uihlein , sued the state for declining to publish voter data on the internet.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a focus on the really granular things that maybe a couple of years ago weren\u2019t litigated to the same degree that they are now,\u201d said Adam Sopko, staff attorney with the Wisconsin Law School\u2019s State Democracy Research Initiative.\n\n(Adds the number of cases that Restoring Integrity and Trust in Elections supported in 13th paragraph.)\n\nTo contact the authors of this story:\n\nEmily Birnbaum in Washington at ebirnbaum3@bloomberg.net\n\nBill Allison in Washington at ballison14@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story:\n\nRomy Varghese at rvarghese8@bloomberg.net\n\nElizabeth Wasserman\n\n\u00a9 2024 Bloomberg L.P.

It had already obtained a presidential ballot line in 21 states and predicted more to come. It also has raised tens of millions of dollars from an undisclosed list of donors.\n\nThe group conducted public opinion polls and touted scenarios where its candidate could win the presidency as an alternative to a Trump-Biden contest that has left many Americans dissatisfied.\n\nBut it was not enough to convince anyone of note to take the plunge.\n\nNo Labels reportedly discussed potential presidential bids with an array of prominent centrist politicians, including Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Republican former Governor Larry Hogan of Maryland and former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who has twice run for the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nUltimately they all disavowed any interest in what mainstream polling suggests would be a futile effort - and one that could help hand Mr Trump the presidency by peeling away moderate voters who might otherwise back Mr Biden.\n\n\"If there is not a pathway to win and if my candidacy in any way, shape or form would help Donald Trump become president again, then it is not the way forward,\" Mr Christie said last month.\n\nThe No Labels announcement will be cheered by Democrats, but there are still a handful of independent candidates who have the potential to shake up the 2020 presidential election rematch.\n\nRobert F Kennedy Jr, who has mixed some traditional liberal positions with anti-establishment and anti-vaccine views, is gaining ballot access and continues to poll near double digits. Academic Cornel West and a yet-to-be-decided Green Party candidate could attract more liberal voters among the Democratic ranks.",

        "text": "GOP suffers big setback in effort to make winning potentially critical Nebraska electoral vote more likely\nBiden and Trump win primaries, but some results show some voters still prefer another candidate\n\nA lone electoral vote in Nebraska could have a decisive impact on the 2024 presidential election. And prominent Republicans have attempted to make it more likely that the vote could be added to the GOP column in November.\n\nBut, reports CBS Lincoln/Grand Island affiliate KOLN/KGIN-TV, that effort was dealt a big blow by Nebraska lawmakers Wednesday when they voted overwhelmingly to keep an amendment to the state's election law from being attached to an unrelated bill.\n\nNebraska is a reliably red state in presidential races. The last Democratic presidential candidate to win statewide was Lyndon B. Johnson over half a century ago.\n\nBut Nebraska is one of only two states \u2014 Maine is the other \u2014 that awards a portion of its respective electoral votes to the candidate who wins individual congressional districts. Its most closely watched electoral vote typically comes from an area that includes the major metro city of Omaha and is far more competitive than the rest of the state. The district's electoral vote has swung back and forth in recent cycles.\n\nRepublican Donald Trump won the district's electoral vote in 2016, but he lost it to Democrat Joe Biden in 2020. Democratic President Barack Obama lost it to Republican Mitt Romney in 2012, but had won it in his first run for the White House in 2008.\n\nThe 2024 rematch between Mr. Biden and Trump is expected to be a close race nationally, and in at least one scenario, the presidency could come down to who wins the Omaha-based district. The path is far from a sure thing, but in an unusual election cycle like 2024, the unlikely can quickly become increasingly possible.\n\nIf Trump wins all the electoral votes he carried in 2020, and wins Arizona, Georgia and Nevada \u2014 all states that he lost in the first matchup against Mr. Biden \u2014 he would have 268 electoral votes, two shy of winning back the White House.\n\nIf Mr. Biden carries the remaining electoral votes he won in 2020, including those in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, he would be one vote short of winning a second term.\n\nIn this situation Mr. Biden would have to win the Omaha congressional district in Nebraska to become president outright.\n\nIf Trump were to win all of Nebraska's electoral votes, including the Omaha swing district, the electoral college would be tied at 269 to 269, sending the outcome of the election to the U.S. House to be decided.\n\nEarlier this week, one prominent right wing commentator seemed to take note of Nebraska's potentially decisive role in the election.\n\nCharlie Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA, posted on social media about the situation on Tuesday afternoon, writing that \"Nebraskans should call their legislators and their governor to demand their state stop pointlessly giving strength to their political enemies.\"\n\nHe also called attention to a bill in the Nebraska Legislature that would shift the state to a winner-take-all system and end the practice of giving each congressional district its own electoral vote. He ended his message with an encouragement for people to reach out to the state's GOP Gov. Jim Pillen and \"let him know you want this fixed.\"\n\nHours later, Pillen's office posted a statement on X, formerly known as Twitter, emphasizing his support for the bill and calling for the change to pass. And later that night, Trump himself posted on social media applauding the governor's statement.\n\nCBS News has reached out to the Biden campaign and Republican Congressman Don Bacon, who represents Omaha's congressional district, for comment.\n\nJane Kleeb, chair of the Nebraska Democratic Party, said in a statement that \"Nebraskans want to keep our fair electoral system in place which is why previous attempts by some Republicans over the last thirty years have failed to undo our split electoral votes.\"\n\nAll that talk didn't mean the Nebraska Legislature was ready to plow ahead and upend the state's electoral system, despite the strong GOP nature of the state. But the surge in attention points to how close the 2024 election could turn out to be.\n\n\"It's pathetic,\" Nebraska State Sen. Megan Hunt, who is not a Biden supporter and represents part of Omaha, said in a text message to CBS News when asked about the GOP push. \"And if [Trump] wants to win Omaha's vote, he should come earn it.\"\n\nThe amendment to make Nebraska a winner-take-all state was proposed by Republican State Sen. Julie Slama. After its defeat, Democratic State Sen. John Cavanaugh, who represents Omaha, told The Washington Post in a text message that Republicans have few other paths to make the change in this legislative session.\n\nBrian Dakss, Aaron Navarro and Olivia Rinaldi contributed to this report.",

        "text": "RELEASE: OPM Issues Final Rule to Reinforce and Clarify Protections for Nonpartisan Career Civil Service\nWashington, D.C. \u2013 The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) today announced a final rule that clarifies and reinforces long-standing protections and merit system principles for career civil servants.\n\n\u201cCareer federal employees deliver critical services for Americans in every community,\u201d said OPM Director Kiran Ahuja. \u201cThis final rule honors our 2.2 million career civil servants, helping ensure that people are hired and fired based on merit and that they can carry out their duties based on their expertise and not political loyalty. The Biden-Harris Administration is deeply committed to the federal workforce, as these professionals are vital to our national security, our health, our economic prosperity, and much more.\u201d\n\n\u201cNonpartisan civil servants make sure our food is safe and our water is clean. They protect us from national security threats, care for veterans, and support our seniors,\u201d said OPM Deputy Director Rob Shriver. \u201cThis final rule builds on three years of the Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s efforts to strengthen federal agencies and the federal workforce.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Biden-Harris Administration knows that career civil servants are the backbone of the federal workforce and should be able to provide the expertise and experience necessary for the critical functioning of the federal government,\u201d said White House Office of Management and Budget Deputy Director for Management Jason Miller. \u201cAs part of the President\u2019s Management Agenda, it is a clear policy of the United States government to protect, empower, and rebuild the career federal workforce, and this final rule does just that.\u201d\n\nIn the first week of the Biden-Harris Administration, President Biden revoked an Executive Order issued by the previous Administration that risked altering our country\u2019s long-standing merit-based civil service system, by creating new excepted service schedule, known as \u201cSchedule F,\u201d and directing agencies to move potentially large swathes of career employees into this new excepted service status. This attempt would have stripped career civil servants of their civil service protections that ensure that decisions to hire and fire are based on merit, not political considerations.\n\nThe final rule advances these important policy goals by:\n\nClarifying that the status and civil service protections an employee has accrued cannot be taken away by an involuntary move from the competitive service to the excepted service, or from one excepted service schedule to another. Once a career civil servant earns protections, that employee retains them unless waived voluntarily.\n\n\n\nClarifying that the phrase \u201cconfidential, policy determining, policymaking, or policy-advocating\u201d positions\u2014a term of art to describe positions that lack civil service protections\u2014means noncareer, political appointments. This rule prevents that exception from being misapplied to career civil servants.\n\n\n\nEstablishing procedural requirements for moving positions from the competitive service to the excepted service and within the excepted service. This change both creates transparency and establishes an appeals process for federal employees when any such movement is involuntary and characterized as stripping employees of their civil service protections.\n\nOPM issued the final rule after reviewing and responding to more than 4,000 comments submitted by the public in an open and transparent policy-making process. The final rule was posted for Public Inspection on Thursday, April 4 and will be published in the Federal Register on Tuesday, April 9.",

Thus far, this year is atypical.\n\nWe believe the market has yet to fully engage with the election narrative as there is usually more uncertainty over the nominees. But other uncertainties are waiting in the wings.\n\nThe U.S. Economic Policy Uncertainty Index has averaged 17 percent higher in presidential election years than non-election periods, and this year promises to accelerate the recent trend.\n\nThe 2024 election is also occurring in a period of high global geopolitical instability, as indicated by the Geopolitical Risk Index.\n\nIn periods of heightened economic policy and geopolitical uncertainty, higher quality bonds tend to outperform equities and exhibit lower volatility.\n\nHistory also shows that we should not expect the Federal Reserve (Fed) to change its policy execution strategy because of the election, nor should we expect it to tip the scales one way or the other.\n\nWith uncertainty likely to rise and the Fed expected to cut rates later this year, investors should consider increasing allocations to strategies invested in higher quality fixed income. Election Year Equity Returns Typically Stay Subdued But Rise After November Numerous studies have examined how risk assets fare in election years. Our analysis shows that presidential elections have weighed on risk assets in the months leading up to the election. Since 1985, the S&P 500 index has generally performed better between January and October in non-election years than in election years, with an average return of 12 percent in the former compared to less than 1 percent gain in the latter. The market performed better after the elections take place in November, as the removal of uncertainty has had a positive effect. This insight should help investors set realistic expectations for election years to strategize for potential volatility between January and November, and to understand the typically transient impact of elections on markets.\n\nEquities Have Outperformed Their Typical Election Year Trajectory this Year S&P 500 Performance During Election and Non-Election Years Source: Guggenheim Investments, Bloomberg. Data as of 3.31.2024. Past performance does not guarantee future returns.\n\nThat said, this year is atypical. The S&P 500\u2019s current year-to-date performance through January exceeds the typical trajectory for an election year, recording a 5 percent increase and setting new record highs. Absent additional context, the market appears poised to defy historical precedent and deliver strong gains despite a major election looming. It is possible that diminishing fears of a U.S. recession and anticipation of rate cuts are overshadowing the usual election-related uncertainties that tend to constrain risk assets. We believe this year\u2019s market performance can be explained by the inference that the market has yet to fully engage with the election narrative. At this point in a typical presidential election year, there is uncertainty over at least one of the candidates, and in a year in which there is no incumbent running, there is uncertainty over both. This is not the case in 2024. This year, it is highly likely that the election will be a rematch from 2020, and by all accounts the second Biden vs. Trump race will be as tight as the first contest. In a rematch that feels like two incumbents running against each other, election year uncertainty over the nominees is missing, but other uncertainties are waiting in the wings. Once the market begins to focus on these election-related questions, the adjustment could be painful given several dynamics discussed below. The Real Issue for Investors in 2024 Is Economic Policy Uncertainty Policy uncertainty tends to rise during U.S. presidential election periods. If the executive branch transitions from one party to another, or stronger mandates are provided to the party in power, we often see substantial shifts in key policies, including taxation, healthcare, entitlements, and regulations. Since 1985, during U.S. presidential election years, the U.S. Economic Policy Uncertainty Index, which measures uncertainty related to economic policy based on media coverage, has averaged 17 percent higher relative to non-election periods. This trend has become even more pronounced over the past five elections, highlighting the potential for such uncertainty to reach unprecedented levels this year, especially given the upcoming election\u2019s highly contentious nature and the deep polarization on policy issues.\n\nPolicy Uncertainty Tends to Rise During Presidential Elections Economic policy uncertainty in election cycles since 1985 Source: Guggenheim Investments, Haver. Data as of 12.31.2023. The Economic Policy Uncertainty Index tracks geopolitical events and associated risks based on a tally of newspaper articles covering geopolitical tensions.\n\nIf anything, this year promises to accelerate the recent trend, as the country braces for an exceptionally close and rancorous election. President Biden faces an unusually challenging landscape, marked by the highest disapproval rating for a president entering an election year since President Carter in 1980. The growing hyperpolarization of the two major parties also highlights the stark policy disparities between Biden and Trump. The nearby chart shows how wide the gulf is between Democrat and Republican voters on key issues, which suggests possible abrupt shifts in policy expectations. Key issues at stake include U.S. engagement overseas, restrictions on trade and capital flows, immigration, support for Ukraine, and NATO commitments. Moreover, Trump\u2019s legal entanglements and potential social unrest following the election will only add to the prevailing uncertainty.\n\nSharp Partisan Rift over Trade, Immigration, Foreign Relations, and Climate Issues Could Lead to Abrupt Policy U-Turns Source: Guggenheim Investments, Chicago Council on Global Affairs. Data as of 12.31.2023.\n\nHigher Quality Fixed Income Outperformed in Periods of High Uncertainty The policy gulf between the two candidates and parties should lead to more uncertainty. As of January 2024, however, the U.S. Economic Policy Uncertainty Index is below the average reading of historical presidential election years, and more importantly, well below the average reading of the five most recent presidential elections. When economic policy risk is low, risky assets like stocks and below investment-grade credit tend to perform best, which is consistent with the observed cross asset performance in U.S. markets over the last six and 12 months. However, during periods marked by heightened policy uncertainty, which we believe could characterize the next several months leading up to the election, higher quality bonds tend to outperform. Since 1986, in instances where the U.S. Economic Policy Uncertainty Index was more than one standard deviation above its mean, returns for U.S. Treasury securities and investment-grade corporate bonds were, on average, more than 10 percentage points greater than equities, which typically experienced negative returns.\n\nHigher Quality Fixed Income Has Outperformed When Policy Uncertainty Is High Economic policy uncertainty and asset class annualized returns since 1985 Source: Guggenheim Investments, Bloomberg, Haver. Data as of 12.31.2023. Past performance does not guarantee future returns.\n\nMoreover, we believe higher quality fixed income typically offers the most predictable returns when uncertainty over election outcomes and economic policies is high, based on standard deviation. In the same periods with elevated policy uncertainty, investment-grade corporate bonds and Treasurys not only demonstrated superior performance but also lower volatility. This outperformance of higher quality fixed income may indicate a preference among investors for more predictable returns in times when a clear view of future policies is elusive. Additionally, the lack of clarity around government policies can constrict the economy\u2019s capital supply and increase friction in financial markets, ultimately exerting a drag on economic growth and returns of riskier assets.\n\nHigher Quality Fixed Income Demonstrates Lower Volatility of Returns in Times of Unpredictability Economic policy uncertainty and asset class annualized volatility since 1985 Source: Guggenheim Investments, Bloomberg, Haver. Data as of 12.31.2023. Past performance does not guarantee future returns.\n\nIn sum, during periods of higher economic policy uncertainty, higher quality fixed income has historically generated both higher returns and lower volatility.\n\nAverage Return vs. Average Volatility in Different Economic Policy Uncertainty Regimes Source: Guggenheim Investments, Bloomberg, Haver. Data as of 12.31.2023. Past performance does not guarantee future returns.\n\nRising Geopolitical Uncertainty May Also Help Higher Quality Bonds Beyond simmering domestic uncertainty in the United States, the forthcoming U.S. election is occurring in the context of growing global geopolitical instability. For instance, bipartisan animosity towards China may prompt both parties to harden their positions. When combined with a new hardline Taiwanese president aiming to secure stronger U.S. security guarantees, this situation could lead to a standoff between the United States and China in the Taiwan Strait. Furthermore, the razor thin margins in the presidential campaign create an opportunity for foreign countries to capitalize on Biden\u2019s vulnerabilities in the leadup to the election. Iran might use Biden\u2019s reluctance for escalation to counteract the bolstering of U.S.-Israel security cooperation against Tehran, potentially orchestrating attacks through proxies. Similarly, Russia could exploit Biden\u2019s concern over energy costs by weaponizing oil and gas to weaken the Democrats, aiming to diminish U.S. support for Ukraine. The interplay between domestic electoral dynamics and international strategic maneuvers underscores the multifaceted challenges facing U.S. economic policy and national security. Any geopolitical upheavals, particularly in oil production or chip supply chains, could profoundly destabilize the U.S. and global economies. Again, an environment with elevated geopolitical risks, as indicated by the news coverage-based Economic Policy Uncertainty Index, may also favor investment-grade corporate bonds and U.S. Treasurys.\n\nGeopolitical Tensions Generally Weigh on Riskier Assets Geopolitical uncertainty* and asset returns (annualized six-month trailing %) Source: Guggenheim Investments, Bloomberg, Haver. Data as of 12.31.2023. *The Economic Policy Uncertainty Index tracks geopolitical events and associated risks based on a tally of newspaper articles covering geopolitical tensions. Past performance does not guarantee future returns.\n\nInvestment Implications As we approach the presidential election in November, the unveiling of candidates\u2019 political agendas could introduce a layer of uncertainty that has the potential to affect market performance, particularly for riskier assets that tend to falter amid heightened economic policy uncertainty. Failing to account for the unique and competitive nature of this election cycle might result in inadequate asset allocation in investment portfolios, overweighting unnecessary risk and missing out on the advantages of diversification. With policy risk set to rise and the Fed expected to cut rates later this year, investors should consider increasing allocations to strategies invested in higher quality fixed income, given its track record of outperformance during periods of elevated uncertainty.\n\nDispelling the Myth that the Fed Abstains from Policy Moves During Presidential Election Years Election years often bring concerns that the Fed would refrain from making significant policy moves. After all, the Fed is politically independent and a rate hike or rate cut could carry implications of a political motive. History shows that this is not the case. Indeed, the Fed has adjusted policy at a similar frequency and in similar directions in election years and non-election years. Quarterly Fed Policy Moves During Election and Non-Election Years Zooming in on just presidential election years, the Fed has also shown no particular disinclination to make a monetary policy change. Indeed, the Fed has moved rates during 14 of the last 16 presidential elections since 1956. Perhaps more importantly, these changes have not made a difference to the outcome. In a year in which the Fed is expected to cut rates, we should not expect the Fed to change its policy execution strategy because of the election, nor should we expect it to tip the scales one way or the other.

In general, the value of a fixed-income security falls when interest rates rise and rises when interest rates fall. Longer term bonds are more sensitive to interest rate changes and subject to greater volatility than those with shorter maturities. During periods of declining rates, the interest rates on floating rate securities generally reset downward and their value is unlikely to rise to the same extent as comparable fixed rate securities. High yield and unrated debt securities are at a greater risk of default than investment grade bonds and may be less liquid, which may increase volatility. Investors in asset-backed securities, including mortgage-backed securities and collateralized loan obligations (\u201cCLOs\u201d), generally receive payments that are part interest and part return of principal. These payments may vary based on the rate loans are repaid. Some asset-backed securities may have structures that make their reaction to interest rates and other factors difficult to predict, making their prices volatile and they are subject to liquidity and valuation risk. CLOs bear similar risks to investing in loans directly, such as credit, interest rate, counterparty, prepayment, liquidity, and valuation risks. Loans are often below investment grade, may be unrated, and typically offer a fixed or floating interest rate. The Bloomberg U.S. Corporate Bond Index measures the investment grade, fixed-rate, taxable corporate bond market. It includes USD-denominated securities publicly issued by U.S. and non-U.S. industrial, utility, and financial issuers. The Bloomberg U.S. Corporate High Yield Bond Index measures the USD-denominated non-investment grade, fixed-rate, taxable corporate bonds. Securities are classified as high yield if the middle rating of Moody\u2019s, Fitch, and S&P is Bal/BB+/BB+ or below. The index excludes emerging market debt. The S&P 500 Index is a capitalization weighted index of 500 stocks, actively traded in the U.S, designed to measure the performance of the broad economy, representing all major industries. The Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Index measures U.S. dollar-denominated, fixed-rate, nominal debt issued by the U.S. Treasury with remaining maturity of at least one year. The Bloomberg U.S. Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS) Index tracks fixed-rate Agency mortgage backed pass-through securities guaranteed by Ginnie Mae (GNMA), Fannie Mae (FNMA), and Freddie Mac (FHLMC).\n\n\n\nThis material is distributed or presented for informational or educational purposes only and should not be considered a recommendation of any particular security, strategy or investment product, or as investing advice of any kind.

It had already obtained a presidential ballot line in 21 states and predicted more to come. It also has raised tens of millions of dollars from an undisclosed list of donors.\n\nThe group conducted public opinion polls and touted scenarios where its candidate could win the presidency as an alternative to a Trump-Biden contest that has left many Americans dissatisfied.\n\nBut it was not enough to convince anyone of note to take the plunge.",

The Hatch Act doesn\u2019t pertain to voting, however, which Delimata said all employees can and should do.\n\n\u201cEverybody, regardless of which category they\u2019re in, can give money to a political party or candidate, go to rallies, sign nominating petitions and do things like follow political social media pages using personal accounts,\u201d Delimata said. \u201cBut the main takeaway here is that they can\u2019t do these things on government time or in government space.\u201d\n\nWhile employees may \u201clike\u201d a political ad while on their lunch break if they\u2019re working from home, they can\u2019t if having lunch in a government building, whether they\u2019re in a workspace or a location such as a break room, gym or cafeteria.\n\nSome acceptable activities for less restricted employees while off duty and away from a government facility include:\n\nVolunteering to work on the campaign of a candidate running for political office.\n\nServing as an election judge for a city or county.\n\nWorking or standing at the polls for a candidate on Election Day.\n\nWearing clothing or accessories bearing political slogans or statements.\n\nWriting a letter to an editor or presenting a speech, in a personal capacity, that endorses a candidate running for office.\n\nThe main differences for further restricted employees include not being permitted to work on political campaigns, or work or stand at the polls for a candidate on Election Day.\n\nViolations should be reported to ethics counselors at DLA major subordinate commands or DLA Headquarters. Cases are sent to the U.S. Office of Special Counsel for investigation.\n\n\u201cNine times out of 10, it\u2019s not a violation,\u201d Delimata said.\n\nThe Hatch Act was created in 1939 to protect federal employees from political coercion in the workplace, to ensure employees are advanced based on merit rather than political affiliation, and to ensure activities of the federal government are carried out in a nonpartisan fashion.\n\nServicemembers\n\nGuidelines for military members are outlined in Defense Department Directive 1344.10, \u201cPolitical Activities by Members of the Armed Forces on Active Duty.\u201d Most restrictions for further restricted employees also apply to servicemembers, who must avoid appearances that their political activities imply DOD sponsorship, approval, or endorsement of a political candidate, campaign, or cause.\n\nMilitary members are also barred from giving political speeches or serving in any official capacity of political groups. And all federal employees and servicemembers are prohibited from soliciting, accepting or receiving contributions.\n\nConsequences of violating federal and DOD laws on political activities range from a 30-day suspension without pay to removal from federal service. Military members are subject to disciplinary action.\n\nMore information on the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts of political activity is available at DLA\u2019s Hatch Act Guidance page.",

        "text": "Legal experts assess the impact of this super election year on the art market\nTaxation and Import VAT\n\nIn 2024, general elections will take place in the US, India, and the UK, and there will be EU-wide elections for the European Parliament. In election years, taxation is usually at the top of the political agenda. Often, tax considerations affecting the art market are formulated with zero-sum calculations in mind. One country\u2019s gain by way of an advantageous tax regime will result in another country\u2019s loss.\n\nEU Directive 2022/542 aims to create closer alignment of Member States\u2019 VAT regimes. Previously, it was only possible for Member States to apply a reduced VAT rate on imported works of art, collectors\u2019 items, and antiques, and works sold by artists themselves. Following the implementation of the directive, these objects can benefit from reduced VAT rates at the point of sale in their local primary and secondary markets and when purchased by museums. EU Member States first must each transpose the amendments and apply the new measures by January 1, 2025.\n\nHowever, the directive does not allow for the cumulative application of the reduced VAT rate on artwork imports in conjunction with the application of the margin scheme when selling the artwork. In other words, pursuant to the provisions, it will not be possible for a dealer first to benefit from the reduced VAT rate upon importation into the EU and then, upon onward sale, benefit from being taxed on the margin between purchase price and onward-sale price only.\n\nImplementing the directive, France could have chosen to maintain the 20% rate on profit margins for secondary sales, but would have had to extend that rate to imports and primary sales of art. To the relief of many French art market participants, French lawmakers opted instead to legislate not only to continue to offer a reduced rate at 5.5% for imported artworks, but also to extend the reduced rate to the vast majority of VAT-able transactions of artworks in France which are set to be taxed at 5.5% from 2025 onwards. This amendment may be seen as an attempt to consolidate France\u2019s position as the continent\u2019s leading international art market further.",

        "text": "Presidential Candidate Profile: Donald Trump\u2019s record on animal protection\nWith the Super Tuesday primary elections behind us, and the Democratic and Republican Party nominations nearly settled, we wanted to provide a review of the animal welfare records of President Biden and President Trump.\n\nAs the leading voice in animal protection politics, we provide an objective analysis of candidates, free from judgements based on political party affiliation or on the candidates\u2019 positions on any other issues. HSLF evaluates candidates for political office at all levels of government on their records and commitments concerning animal protection, as well as on their electability.\n\nGiven Donald Trump\u2019s status as the presumptive Republican nominee in the 2024 presidential election, a full review of the Trump Administration\u2019s animal protection record between 2017-2020 is warranted. When we at Humane Society Legislative Fund published our first analysis of President Trump\u2019s legacy on animal welfare, he had 6 months left in office; a time which resulted in both significant gains and losses for our nation\u2019s animals.\n\nOn the positive side, President Trump was responsible for signing multiple landmark animal protection measures into law. He wasted no time signing the Preventing Animal Cruelty and Torture (PACT) Act, designating certain acts of extreme animal cruelty as felony crimes. He authorized the federal omnibus package of 2020 which included the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Act, requiring the oversight and strict regulation of practices in the horseracing industry. And he also signed the 2018 Farm Bill, which effectively banned the slaughter or trade in dog and cat meat, funded a grant program to provide transitional sheltering options for domestic violence survivors fleeing with pets, and outlawed the barbaric practice of animal fighting in the U.S. territories.\n\n\n\nYet, over the course of his term, the Trump Administration often favored special interests over wildlife. President Trump himself tweeted that \u201cbig-game\u201d trophy hunting was a \u201chorror show,\u201d which he believed did not support the conservation of elephants or any other animal. Notwithstanding, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service lifted existing Obama-era bans on the import of elephant and lion trophies from certain African countries, deciding to approve imports on a case-by-case basis. In these matters, the FWS chose to cater to the interests of wealthy trophy hunters and groups like the NRA and Safari Club International.\n\nThe Department of the Interior under President Trump overturned a rule prohibiting controversial hunting and killing methods on 20 million acres of National Preserve lands in Alaska, and the administration opened up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to vast oil drilling. The FWS carried out the largest expansion of hunting and fishing opportunities in U.S. history, opening the gates to 2.1 million acres at 88 wildlife refuges and hatcheries. Moreover, the FWS removed Endangered Species Act protections for grizzly bears in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem and gray wolves across the lower 48 states, though both actions were subsequently overturned by courts.\n\nOne area in which the Trump Administration showed great promise involved the use of animals in research and testing. President Trump\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency embraced a vision of a future free of animal testing, releasing a plan to promote the development and implementation of alternative product testing methods, and then announcing a goal to end all animal testing on mammals for chemicals and pesticides by 2035.\n\nThings were challenging at the U.S. Department of Agriculture under President Trump. In the administration\u2019s earliest days, the agency instituted a website data purge of important enforcement records related to horse soring, dog breeding operations, and related facilities regulated by the Animal Welfare Act (AWA). These crucial records were only restored after years of fighting by HSLF, and due to an express directive by Congress. The agency also cut back drastically on the number of AWA citations and enforcement actions for enterprises like puppy mills and roadside zoos. At the same time, the USDA did finalize a positive licensing rule, strengthening some standards for USDA licensing of dog breeders.\n\nThe Trump Administration\u2019s record on farmed animal welfare was bleak. The USDA repealed an Obama-era rule on organic farming, which had set basic standards of care for the national organic label. The agency took steps to ensure that all beef, pork, and poultry slaughterhouses and processing plants remained open and fulfilled orders throughout the COVID-19 pandemic\u2014which proved harmful and even fatal to slaughterhouse workers. And the USDA even ruled that these slaughterhouses could increase their line speeds, allowing them to operate at a dangerously high pace. Moreover, the EPA chose to deny a petition to list Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) as sources of pollution under the Clean Air Act, exempting massive factory farms from reporting emissions. And perhaps most importantly, the Trump Administration filed an amicus brief seeking to overturn the nation\u2019s strongest farm animal protection law in California\u2019s Proposition 12.\n\nThe Trump Administration also failed the horses subjected to the cruel practice of \u201csoring,\u201d by unlawfully withdrawing a USDA agency rule years in the making\u2014the rule would have strengthened the USDA\u2019s Horse Protection Act regulations by banning the use of cruel horse soring devices, as well as ending the failed system of industry self-policing.\n\nDuring his time in office, President Trump\u2019s agencies worked to change the entire regulatory landscape concerning animals. The Endangered Species Act became a tool used primarily to take federal protections away, rather than to grant them, as a series of rules were finalized making it harder to achieve federal protections for endangered and threatened species in need. Yet, the administration also worked to secure significant protections for whales, leatherback and loggerhead turtles, whitetip sharks, bison, service animals, and NIH research animals who were made eligible for retirement as adoptable pets.\n\nAs with those that came before it, the Trump Administration\u2019s legacy on animal protection is mixed. We celebrated several big wins for animals. But overall, the damage it wrought to wildlife, farmed animals, and beyond was significant.\n\nOn the road to November, please remember to update your voter registration, request an absentee ballot, and take other steps to participate in this critically important election.\n\nBe sure to also check out our analysis of President Biden\u2019s record on animal protection in yesterday\u2019s blog.",

Over its nearly four-hundred-year history, the guard has transformed from a loose collection of colonial militias into a well-trained and equipped force that often serves side by side with active-duty military personnel.\n\nThe guard is also distinctive in that it serves under both state and federal command. It has been called upon in recent years to respond to many domestic events, including natural disasters, the COVID-19 pandemic, anti-racism protests, and border security challenges. As its domestic role has grown, the guard has also become more integral to international U.S. military operations. The Air National Guard in particular carries out critical military intelligence analysis, including in Ukraine and the Middle East.\n\nWhat is the National Guard?\n\nThe National Guard is unique among the U.S. armed forces in that it can perform state and federal functions. The guard is generally called up to respond to state-level emergencies, such as natural disasters. But, unlike most of the other military forces, it can also serve a domestic law enforcement role. Additionally, the president can deploy the guard to serve missions overseas, which has happened more frequently in recent years, including to Afghanistan, Iraq, Poland, and the Horn of Africa.\n\nDaily News Brief A summary of global news developments with CFR analysis delivered to your inbox each morning.

It consists of two parts: the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard, which are both considered U.S. military reserve components but are distinct from the army and air force reserves. The guard is overseen at the federal level by the National Guard Bureau, the head of which is a four-star general and member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the military\u2019s top advisory body.\n\nAs of fiscal year 2022, there were 434,689 guard members [PDF] in total, serving in fifty-four separate organizations across the fifty states; Washington, DC; and three U.S. territories: Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.\n\nMany members of the National Guard serve part-time while holding civilian jobs or attending school. Guard members commit to one weekend of training per month plus a minimum of a few weeks of service per year. Most members serve in the states in which they live.\n\nHow did the Guard come about?\n\nThe National Guard traces its origins to the militias established by the American colonies. These militias grew out of the English tradition of organizing citizen-soldiers to provide for the common defense. The guard\u2019s birthday is December 13, 1636, when the Massachusetts Bay Colony created the colonies\u2019 first militia regiments. The state militias were preserved after the founding of the United States, reflecting the balance sought by the Constitution between state and federal authorities.\n\nHowever, it wasn\u2019t until the early twentieth century, particularly after the passage of the 1903 Militia Act, and continuing through both World Wars, that the guard was transformed from a loosely organized network of militias into the well-equipped and regimented force it remains today. It was also during this period that the state-federal relationship became more defined.\n\nWho controls it?\n\nMost of the time, state National Guards are activated and commanded by the governors of their respective states or territories, but presidents (with input from top officials) can federalize the guard in certain cases. (The DC National Guard is solely under federal control.) For instance, presidents have called units into federal service to respond to extreme weather events such as hurricanes and wildfires, bolster border security, and assist U.S. military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Unlike state missions, which generally last less than three months, federal deployments tend to last at least a year. On international missions, the guard is often trained and commanded by active-duty military personnel, and their duties can be identical to their active-duty counterparts; however, hiring and other administrative tasks typically remain managed by state guard units. The National Guard can also be federalized but kept under state control, with the federal government paying for the deployment. (Statewide operations are normally funded by the state.) This was done in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in many states.\n\nPresidents rarely federalize a state or territory\u2019s guard without the consent of the governor. In the wake of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, President George W. Bush declined to take control of Louisiana\u2019s National Guard due to the objection of Governor Kathleen Blanco. Governors have at times requested that the federal government assume control over their guard units, as California Governor Pete Wilson did during the 1992 Los Angeles riots.\n\nWhere does the National Guard deploy?\n\nThe National Guard fulfills a range of duties, including:\n\nDisaster relief. The guard is frequently called up to respond to statewide emergencies, such as natural disasters. For example, more than one hundred thousand National Guard members were deployed to combat wildfires across nineteen states in 2022. The guard also prepares every year for the hurricanes that routinely strike the southeastern United States. In 2019, the guard responded to sixty-three natural disasters, including seven hurricanes or tropical storms, nineteen floods, and twelve fires. In 2023, members of the Hawaii Army National Guard were mobilized to support disaster response efforts after a massive wildfire on the island of Maui, Hawaii, including by ensuring public order and engaging in search and recovery missions.\n\nMilitary support. The National Guard plays a crucial role in supporting U.S. military operations [PDF] abroad. Since 9/11, more than one million National Guard members have deployed to theaters including Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as countries in Europe and the Pacific. Most recently, the National Guard has helped collect and analyze intelligence related to Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and assisted in training members of Ukraine\u2019s armed forces. Members of the guard have fought in nearly every U.S. conflict since the Revolutionary War, and more than twenty thousand are deployed around the world on any given day.\n\nThe Air National Guard in particular has played a growing role in military operations, especially in drone operations and data analysis. At some air force bases within the United States, members of the Air National Guard serve alongside active-duty personnel.\n\nLaw enforcement. The guard can be deployed by state governors for law enforcement purposes. Many states activated their National Guards in response to historic anti-racism protests across the United States after Minneapolis police killed George Floyd in May 2020. In January 2021, the DC National Guard was deployed in response to an assault on the U.S. Capitol by a mob backing President Donald Trump while lawmakers were meeting to certify the presidential election. The guard was later quartered inside the Capitol building, evoking comparisons to the Civil War. In March 2024, in response to a surge in subway crime, New York Governor Kathy Hochul dispatched several hundred guard members to help police monitor the city\u2019s busiest stations.\n\nBorder Security. The National Guard is part of the complex multiagency border security apparatus. As of May 2023, there were around 2,500 National Guard troops deployed to the U.S.-Mexico border. Some of these troops are on federal missions, directed by the president; others are run by states. At times, non-border states such as Florida and South Dakota have sent their own National Guards to the border. These troops primarily serve in an administrative capacity, with a directive against performing \u201claw enforcement functions.\u201d\n\nElection support. The guard has provided cybersecurity support in recent years to state and local governments administering elections, including the 2020 presidential contest. Due to the pandemic, guard members performed additional election-related duties, including staffing polling places in some states (though in plain clothes to avoid the perception of military involvement in the political process).\n\nState partnerships. The guard\u2019s State Partnership Program (SPP) aims to increase state military-to-military relationships as a critical U.S. security cooperation tool. Administered by the National Guard Bureau, the SPP boasts partnerships with one hundred partner countries around the world. For example, the California Air National Guard\u2019s partnership with Ukraine proved pivotal during the early stages of Russia\u2019s invasion.\n\nWhat controversies have there been over the Guard?\n\nIn a few instances, presidents and governors have clashed over the military\u2019s domestic law enforcement role, particularly during periods of civil unrest. While governors can call on guard members to serve as temporary law enforcers, presidents cannot do so under normal circumstances. The Posse Comitatus Act generally prohibits the president from using the military in this role. However, presidents can circumvent this law by invoking the Insurrection Act. For example, President Dwight D. Eisenhower used the law to federalize the Arkansas National Guard to enforce desegregation of the state\u2019s schools following the governor\u2019s refusal to comply with the Supreme Court\u2019s Brown v. Board of Education decision. President John F. Kennedy did the same in Alabama and Mississippi.\n\nDebate over the domestic use of the military flared once again in 2020 amid nationwide anti-racism protests sparked by Floyd\u2019s death. President Trump threatened to deploy the military to quell civil unrest in parts of the country, and some Republican lawmakers urged him to do so using the Insurrection Act. Instead, he asked governors to send their National Guard troops to Washington, DC, to aid the federal response there, which was widely criticized as heavy-handed and legally murky. Trump also drew criticism for sending federal agents to several U.S. cities during the protests, including Portland, Oregon. Some Democratic lawmakers have suggested changing the law to prevent such an action.\n\nBy contrast, the response to rioters\u2019 breach of the Capitol in January 2021 was criticized as slow and insufficient. Because Washington, DC, is not a state, the president or Pentagon must give the order for a guard deployment there. Then Acting Defense Secretary Christopher C. Miller ultimately deployed more than one thousand guard members, but some analysts questioned why they had not been positioned near the Capitol preemptively. Tens of thousands of additional guard troops were mobilized in the days following the attack to ensure a peaceful transition of power.\n\nMeanwhile, at the border, National Guard deployments have been criticized for lacking the jurisdiction to implement U.S. immigration policy. Critics say poor working conditions for state deployments, including Texas\u2019s so-called Operation Lone Star, have rendered them particularly ineffective. Others say such deployments are necessary to fill gaps in border patrol.\n\nIn April 2023, the Air National Guard\u2019s expansive role in the military\u2019s foreign surveillance and intelligence operations drew intense scrutiny after the FBI arrested a twenty-one-year-old guardsman for leaking highly classified documents. The disclosures contained top-secret information on the war in Ukraine and internal communications of U.S. partners Israel and South Korea. Critics, including some high-ranking U.S. lawmakers, called for reforms to the system for maintaining classified documents. Others questioned whether the National Guard should have access to critical military intelligence, except at the highest levels of the organization.",

        "text": "Election 2024: China\u2019s Efforts to Interfere in the U.S. Presidential Election\nRussia opened a new chapter in geopolitical competition in 2016 when it used social media to interfere in the U.S. presidential election. Whether that effort affected the election\u2019s outcome can be debated. What seems beyond debate given Russia\u2019s interference attempts in 2020 and again this year is that the Kremlin thinks that meddling works.\n\nNow China looks to be following suit. In February, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued a threat assessment stating: \u201cBeijing is expanding its global covert influence posture to better support the CCP\u2019s goals. The PRC aims to sow doubts about U.S. leadership, undermine democracy, and extend Beijing\u2019s influence.\u201d This week the New York Times reported that \u201ccovert Chinese accounts are masquerading online as American supporters of former President Donald J. Trump, promoting conspiracy theories, stoking domestic divisions and attacking President Biden ahead of the election in November.\u201d This campaign, known as \u201cspamouflage,\u201d has prompted Meta to take down thousands of fake Facebook accounts operating in China.\n\nChina\u2019s interference efforts mark a significant shift in policy. In 2021, the U.S. intelligence community concluded that China opted not to interfere in the 2020 election: \u201cWe assess that China did not deploy interference efforts and considered but did not deploy influence efforts intended to change the outcome of the US Presidential election. We have high confidence in this judgment.\u201d The intelligence community attributed the Chinese decision to a calculation that the costs of being caught meddling outweighed the potential benefits. Likely influencing that judgment was the assessment \u201cthat Russia\u2019s efforts to interfere in the 2016 election significantly damaged Moscow\u2019s position and relationship with the United States.\u201d\n\nThe Water's Edge James M.

Beijing may have decided that a second Trump presidency would better serve its interests than a second Biden presidency, whether because Trump would be more open to cutting a deal, less likely to have an effective foreign policy, or more likely to antagonize U.S. allies. Conversely, Beijing may not see much difference between the two candidates given the broad consensus in the United States that China is America\u2019s primary adversary. Rather than chose between \u201ctwo bowls of poison,\u201d Beijing\u2019s goal may simply be to weaken American democracy, and hence its ability to act coherently abroad, by inflaming political divisions.\n\nAs with Russia\u2019s meddling, it\u2019s difficult to say whether China\u2019s interference will affect the election outcome. The Biden administration, however, isn\u2019t taking any chances. Biden warned Xi Jinping in a phone call this week against interfering in the U.S. election. The fact that call was necessary points to a problem. Last November in San Francisco, Xi promised Biden that China wouldn\u2019t meddle in the U.S. election. That promise now looks hollow. The question is what Biden will do if Chinese interference efforts continue.\n\nStay tuned.\n\nCampaign Update\n\nConnecticut, New York, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin held primaries this week. The results were either meaningless because the nominees of both parties have been decided\u2014or a sign that both nominees have substantial problems heading into the general election. Take your pick. Turnout in all four states was understandably low given that the race of the nomination is over. Nonetheless, between 11 and 14 percent of Republicans who voted in all four states opted for Nikki Haley. Meanwhile, 12 percent of Connecticut Democrats, 15 percent of Rhode Island Democrats, and 8 percent of Wisconsin Democrats vote for \u201cuncommitted\u201d or \u201cuninstructed.\u201d\n\nNebraska Gov. Jim Pillen announced his support this week for awarding all of the state\u2019s electoral votes to the statewide winner of the popular vote. Back in 1991, Nebraska decided to award one electoral vote to the winner of the popular vote in each of the state\u2019s congressional districts. Maine is the only other state to follow this practice. Whether Nebraska returns to the winner-takes-all rule that the other forty-eight states follow could be pivotal to the 2024 election. In 2020, Biden won the Nebraska congressional district centered around Omaha. If he loses Arizona, Georgia, and Nevada this November but wins every other state he won four years ago, that single Nebraska electoral vote would give him a 270 to 268 victory in the Electoral College. Without it, the outcome of the election would be decided by the new House of Representatives. Nebraska\u2019s legislators voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday night to reject a move to change the law. The bill is unlikely to receive another hearing before the legislative session concludes on April 18. However, Governor Pillen could call a special legislative session to consider revising Nebraska\u2019s electoral rules.\n\nThe self-described centrist group No Labels has pulled the plug on its effort to run a third-party ticket. In a statement, the group wrote: \u201cNo Labels has always said we would only offer our ballot line to a ticket if we could identify candidates with a credible path to winning the White House. No such candidates emerged, so the responsible course of action is for us to stand down.\u201d\n\nThe Candidates in Their Own Words\n\nLast month, Trump supporters accused Democrats and the national news media over distorting Trump\u2019s use of the word \u201cbloodbath\u201d in a campaign rally in Ohio. They insisted that the former president was not inciting violence but only using a metaphor describe what lies ahead for the U.S. automotive industry if Biden succeeds in persuading Americans to buy electric vehicles. Trump, however, seems not to have gotten the message. On Tuesday, he told a campaign rally in Grand Rapids that Biden had caused a \u201cborder bloodbath\u201d during a campaign rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan. It didn\u2019t appear to be a slip of the tongue. Trump was standing in front of a sign saying: \u201cStop Biden\u2019s Border Bloodbath.\u201d\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Trump Michigan Video Pause Video Pause Trump Michigan Embed\n\nTrump also responded to Democratic complaints that his language describing immigrants was dehumanizing. Not surprisingly, Trump didn\u2019t back down: \u201cDemocrats said please don\u2019t call them \u2018animals.\u2019 I said, \u2018no, they\u2019re not humans, they\u2019re animals.\u2019\u201d\n\nTrump appeared on Hugh Hewitt\u2019s syndicated national radio show yesterday. The former president expanded on comments he made last week that seemed to criticize Israel\u2019s war against Hamas. Trump agreed with Hewitt\u2019s characterization that he remained \u201c100% with Israel.\u201d Trump added:\n\nI\u2019m not sure that I\u2019m loving the way they\u2019re [the Israelis] doing it, because you\u2019ve got to have victory. You have to have a victory, and it\u2019s taking a long time. And the other thing is I hate, they put out tapes all the time. Every night, they\u2019re releasing tapes of a building falling down. They shouldn\u2019t be releasing tapes like that. They\u2019re doing, that\u2019s why they\u2019re losing the PR war. They, Israel is absolutely losing the PR war.\n\nTrump concluded by saying that the Israelis have \u201cgot to finish what they started, and they\u2019ve got to finish it fast, and we have to get on with life.\u201d\n\nWhat the Pundits Are Saying\n\nFiveThirtyEight.com\u2019s Nathaniel Rakich pulled together polling numbers showing that the Biden-Trump re-run isn\u2019t the most unpopular of the last twelve presidential elections. That distinction remains with the 2016 race that pitted Trump against Hillary Clinton. The average net favorability rating\u2014that is, the favorability ratings minus the unfavorability ratings\u2014of that pair was -18 points. Biden-Trump the rematch is currently standing at -12 points. The most popular pairing? George H. W. Bush and Michael Dukakis back in 1988. Their net favorability rating was +20 points.\n\nPolitico\u2019s Lara Seligman, Stuart Lau, and Pau McLeary wrote that the Biden administration is working with European allies to find ways to ensure that weapons continue to flow to Ukraine even if Trump wins in November. One of the proposals to \u201cTrump-proof\u201d support for Ukraine is to shift leadership of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group from the United States to NATO. In the view of one expert, putting the group \u201cunder NATO kind of isolates it from a Trump presidency, or even from a U.S. that might get distracted by China and can\u2019t keep it going or can\u2019t get his own funding act together.\u201d\n\nWhat the Polls Show\n\nFamiliarity may breed contempt, but absence does not necessarily make the heart grow fonder. That seems to be the takeaway of a Gallup poll released this week. Gallup found that ratings of Biden on a range of character qualities such as \u201cis likeable\u201d and \u201cis honest and trustworthy\u201d have fallen across the board since 2020. His ratings fell by at least six points in every category. The biggest decline was on \u201ccan manage the government effectively.\u201d That rating fell by thirteen points. Conversely, how Americans rate Trump on those same characteristics remained more or less unchanged.\n\nThe Campaign Schedule\n\nTrump\u2019s criminal trial in New York state court for falsifying business records to hide his relationship with Stormy Daniels is set to begin in ten days (April 15, 2024).\n\nThe oral arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court on Trump\u2019s claim that he has blanket immunity for all his actions while president are set to begin in twenty days (April 25, 2024).\n\nThe Republican National Convention opens in Milwaukee in 101 days (July 15, 2024).\n\nThe Democratic National Convention opens in Chicago in 136 days (August 19, 2024).\n\nElection Day is 214 days away.\n\nInauguration Day is 290 days away.\n\nSinet Adous assisted in the preparation of this post\n\nThis publication is part of the Diamonstein-Spielvogel Project on the Future of Democracy.",

        "text": "Biden v Trump: What is at stake in the 2024 US presidential election?\nOn 5 November 2024, up to 161 million American voters will go to the polls to vote for the next president of the United States \u2013 and will be faced with a choice between the same two candidates that stood in 2020. Joe Biden, the incumbent, will again face Donald Trump \u2013 the former president who lost to Biden in 2020. But polling suggests many voters are less than enthused by the choice. Non-MAGA Republicans feeling queasy about the prospect of Trump \u2013 who is still facing a pile of legal challenges \u2013 returning to the White House, and many Democrats wonder if Biden, who would be 86 at the end of a second presidential term, is the best possible candidate.\n\nSo what are we to make of American politics? How does their system work? What will happen in the election? What could this mean for the UK? And is politics in the US a guide to what might happen in the UK?\n\nOn this week\u2019s Expert Factor, the team take a deep breath and take a deep dive into US politics. Mark Landler, London Bureau Chief of the New York Times and a former White House correspondent, joins Hannah, Paul and Anand, who dials in from Boston, to try and make sense of a presidential election that will have consequences across the world.\n\nTHE EXPERT FACTOR is the podcast for people who haven\u2019t had enough of experts. Each week the directors of three leading and respected think tanks \u2013 Paul Johnson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, Hannah White of the Institute for Government, and Anand Menon of UK in a Changing Europe \u2013 get together to discuss, debate and explain the big questions and themes that will shape the election \u2013 and the political landscape for years to come.",

        "text": "The 2024 US Election Is Already Being Fought in the Courts (1)\nFor the 2024 election, Arizona officials didn\u2019t want a repeat of two years ago, when masked and armed people intimidated voters. So the state barred groups from monitoring drop boxes and polling locations.\n\nImmediately, conservative groups filed lawsuits in the Democratic-led swing state, arguing the change violated free speech rights.\n\nPolitical groups \u2014 some backed by anonymous donors \u2014 are launching so many lawsuits over voting rules this year, observers expect that they could approach the record set during the rancorous 2020 election amid Covid and bogus claims of fraud. The Democratic and Republican parties collectively have raised about $41.3 million to spend on such court fights since last year. And nonprofits, including some so-called dark money groups, have likely raised as much as hundreds of millions more.\n\nArmed individuals dressed in tactical gear at a ballot drop box in Mesa, Arizona in October 2022.\n\n\u201cVoters deserve to know they have a system where it\u2019s easy to vote and hard to cheat,\u201d said Scot Mussi, president of the Arizona Free Enterprise Club , which is suing to strike down Arizona\u2019s new rules including those barring the monitoring of polls and drop boxes by outside groups.\n\nAfter the last presidential election, which Donald Trump falsely claimed he won, spurring some of his supporters to riot in the US Capitol, states enacted a number of measures to improve voting procedures and reduce the risk of interference, such as extended polling hours.\n\nNever miss an episode. Follow the\n\nBig Take\n\npodcast on\n\niHeart\n\n,\n\nApple Podcasts\n\n,\n\nSpotify\n\nor wherever you listen.\n\nRead the transcript\n\n.\n\nWith Trump now headed for a rematch with President Joe Biden , political groups are challenging and defending these moves as well as plumbing for legal minutiae, pushing the courts to the center of the election process. Indeed, the US Supreme Court in March rejected a Colorado effort to boot Trump off the ballot.\n\nWhile some lawsuits attempt to address legitimate concerns, others serve as political strategies, said Martha Kropf, a professor of political science at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.\n\n\u201cClose elections mean you\u2019re going to fight to get every extra vote you can,\u201d she said.\n\nWith the presidential race poised to come down to seven pivotal states , Arizona, Michigan and Pennsylvania are already heated battlegrounds for litigation. Judges, not voters, may determine the election results, fear some experts and activists.\n\nArizona, which is also home to a tight US Senate race, hopes to head off the conspiracy theories that sprung up four years ago. Democratic officials said widespread voter intimidation could result if the Arizona Free Enterprise Club\u2019s most recent lawsuit prevails.\n\nAs is the case with other court fights across the country, the limited-government advocacy group works with influential partners, including America First Legal, led by former Trump White House adviser Stephen Miller , and Restoring Integrity and Trust in Elections, a nonprofit backed by Trump allies including billionaire Steve Wynn .\n\nRepublican supporters stand outside the Maricopa County Recorder\u2019s Office to protest the 2022 election in Phoenix, Arizona. Photographer: Alberto Mariani/AP\n\nSuch partnerships lead to more influence. As it takes on more cases, Mussi\u2019s group has seen its revenue jump three times to over $3.4 million in 2022 from the year before, showing how it has quickly become a power player in Arizona.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of good work being done on the conservative side of the spectrum these days to defend elections,\u201d said Derek Lyons , a former Trump adviser who now leads Restoring Integrity and Trust in Elections, which has funded and supported more than 30 cases in 17 states.\n\nProminent Democratic lawyer Marc Elias characterized some of these newly formed ventures as \u201cvigilante.\u201d He and his firm are filing dozens of lawsuits against voting restrictions across the country, often partnering with grassroots groups in swing states.\n\n\u201cNew Republican election vigilante groups are emerging to launch mass voter challenges against unsuspecting voters,\u201d Elias said in a social media post this week.\n\nTwitter: Marc E. Elias on Twitter / X\n\nIndeed, fighting battles over election rules big to arcane is a booming business for such groups and lawyers. Political parties\u2019 legal expenses have skyrocketed to $154 million in 2022 from around $5 million in 2003, according to data compiled by Derek Muller , a law professor at the University of Notre Dame. And nonprofits, including charitable organizations and dark-money advocacy groups, are increasingly filing and financing election-related lawsuits. They\u2019re not legally required to identify their backers.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot of organizations that don\u2019t have to disclose their donors, they don\u2019t have to disclose how they\u2019re spending their money,\u201d said Muller. \u201cThere\u2019s an effort to influence elections through the litigation process without the same transparency we see over on the campaign side.\u201d\n\nChallenging every aspect of the electoral process as a political tool started in earnest after the Supreme Court effectively decided the 2000 presidential contest in favor of George W. Bush over Al Gore in Florida\u2019s recount fight. Election litigation has since tripled, according to research by Rick Hasen , a professor of law and political science at University of California, Los Angeles. Lawsuits span disputes about signatures on absentee ballots to all manners of allegations of illegality.\n\nDuring the 2020 election, public health issues surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic, in addition to the unfounded claims of fraud perpetuated by Trump and his allies, led to a record number of election lawsuits.\n\nCongress played a role in the increase, too: In 2014, it allowed donors to bankroll parties\u2019 legal expenses. The contributions, which currently can be made in amounts up to $123,600, give the parties ample funding to fight in court.\n\nGroups aligned with Democrats say they\u2019re trying to stop voter suppression. Most lawsuits from Republican-leaning allies are aimed at creating more election oversight, including voter identification rules and tighter restrictions on who can vote.\n\nUnsettled Pennsylvania\n\nPennsylvania has the most unsettled questions around its electoral procedures, according to Muller, and both sides of the ideological divide have launched legal challenges since January alone.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania, for one, challenged York County\u2019s restrictions on nonpartisan election observers. And Voter Reference Foundation, a group with ties to GOP megadonor and billionaire Richard Uihlein , sued the state for declining to publish voter data on the internet.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a focus on the really granular things that maybe a couple of years ago weren\u2019t litigated to the same degree that they are now,\u201d said Adam Sopko, staff attorney with the Wisconsin Law School\u2019s State Democracy Research Initiative.\n\n(Adds the number of cases that Restoring Integrity and Trust in Elections supported in 13th paragraph.)\n\nTo contact the authors of this story:\n\nEmily Birnbaum in Washington at ebirnbaum3@bloomberg.net\n\nBill Allison in Washington at ballison14@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story:\n\nRomy Varghese at rvarghese8@bloomberg.net\n\nElizabeth Wasserman\n\n\u00a9 2024 Bloomberg L.P.

It had already obtained a presidential ballot line in 21 states and predicted more to come. It also has raised tens of millions of dollars from an undisclosed list of donors.\n\nThe group conducted public opinion polls and touted scenarios where its candidate could win the presidency as an alternative to a Trump-Biden contest that has left many Americans dissatisfied.\n\nBut it was not enough to convince anyone of note to take the plunge.\n\nNo Labels reportedly discussed potential presidential bids with an array of prominent centrist politicians, including Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Republican former Governor Larry Hogan of Maryland and former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who has twice run for the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nUltimately they all disavowed any interest in what mainstream polling suggests would be a futile effort - and one that could help hand Mr Trump the presidency by peeling away moderate voters who might otherwise back Mr Biden.\n\n\"If there is not a pathway to win and if my candidacy in any way, shape or form would help Donald Trump become president again, then it is not the way forward,\" Mr Christie said last month.\n\nThe No Labels announcement will be cheered by Democrats, but there are still a handful of independent candidates who have the potential to shake up the 2020 presidential election rematch.\n\nRobert F Kennedy Jr, who has mixed some traditional liberal positions with anti-establishment and anti-vaccine views, is gaining ballot access and continues to poll near double digits. Academic Cornel West and a yet-to-be-decided Green Party candidate could attract more liberal voters among the Democratic ranks.",

        "text": "GOP suffers big setback in effort to make winning potentially critical Nebraska electoral vote more likely\nBiden and Trump win primaries, but some results show some voters still prefer another candidate\n\nA lone electoral vote in Nebraska could have a decisive impact on the 2024 presidential election. And prominent Republicans have attempted to make it more likely that the vote could be added to the GOP column in November.\n\nBut, reports CBS Lincoln/Grand Island affiliate KOLN/KGIN-TV, that effort was dealt a big blow by Nebraska lawmakers Wednesday when they voted overwhelmingly to keep an amendment to the state's election law from being attached to an unrelated bill.\n\nNebraska is a reliably red state in presidential races. The last Democratic presidential candidate to win statewide was Lyndon B. Johnson over half a century ago.\n\nBut Nebraska is one of only two states \u2014 Maine is the other \u2014 that awards a portion of its respective electoral votes to the candidate who wins individual congressional districts. Its most closely watched electoral vote typically comes from an area that includes the major metro city of Omaha and is far more competitive than the rest of the state. The district's electoral vote has swung back and forth in recent cycles.\n\nRepublican Donald Trump won the district's electoral vote in 2016, but he lost it to Democrat Joe Biden in 2020. Democratic President Barack Obama lost it to Republican Mitt Romney in 2012, but had won it in his first run for the White House in 2008.\n\nThe 2024 rematch between Mr. Biden and Trump is expected to be a close race nationally, and in at least one scenario, the presidency could come down to who wins the Omaha-based district. The path is far from a sure thing, but in an unusual election cycle like 2024, the unlikely can quickly become increasingly possible.\n\nIf Trump wins all the electoral votes he carried in 2020, and wins Arizona, Georgia and Nevada \u2014 all states that he lost in the first matchup against Mr. Biden \u2014 he would have 268 electoral votes, two shy of winning back the White House.\n\nIf Mr. Biden carries the remaining electoral votes he won in 2020, including those in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, he would be one vote short of winning a second term.\n\nIn this situation Mr. Biden would have to win the Omaha congressional district in Nebraska to become president outright.\n\nIf Trump were to win all of Nebraska's electoral votes, including the Omaha swing district, the electoral college would be tied at 269 to 269, sending the outcome of the election to the U.S. House to be decided.\n\nEarlier this week, one prominent right wing commentator seemed to take note of Nebraska's potentially decisive role in the election.\n\nCharlie Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA, posted on social media about the situation on Tuesday afternoon, writing that \"Nebraskans should call their legislators and their governor to demand their state stop pointlessly giving strength to their political enemies.\"\n\nHe also called attention to a bill in the Nebraska Legislature that would shift the state to a winner-take-all system and end the practice of giving each congressional district its own electoral vote. He ended his message with an encouragement for people to reach out to the state's GOP Gov. Jim Pillen and \"let him know you want this fixed.\"\n\nHours later, Pillen's office posted a statement on X, formerly known as Twitter, emphasizing his support for the bill and calling for the change to pass. And later that night, Trump himself posted on social media applauding the governor's statement.\n\nCBS News has reached out to the Biden campaign and Republican Congressman Don Bacon, who represents Omaha's congressional district, for comment.\n\nJane Kleeb, chair of the Nebraska Democratic Party, said in a statement that \"Nebraskans want to keep our fair electoral system in place which is why previous attempts by some Republicans over the last thirty years have failed to undo our split electoral votes.\"\n\nAll that talk didn't mean the Nebraska Legislature was ready to plow ahead and upend the state's electoral system, despite the strong GOP nature of the state. But the surge in attention points to how close the 2024 election could turn out to be.\n\n\"It's pathetic,\" Nebraska State Sen. Megan Hunt, who is not a Biden supporter and represents part of Omaha, said in a text message to CBS News when asked about the GOP push. \"And if [Trump] wants to win Omaha's vote, he should come earn it.\"\n\nThe amendment to make Nebraska a winner-take-all state was proposed by Republican State Sen. Julie Slama. After its defeat, Democratic State Sen. John Cavanaugh, who represents Omaha, told The Washington Post in a text message that Republicans have few other paths to make the change in this legislative session.\n\nBrian Dakss, Aaron Navarro and Olivia Rinaldi contributed to this report.",

        "text": "RELEASE: OPM Issues Final Rule to Reinforce and Clarify Protections for Nonpartisan Career Civil Service\nWashington, D.C. \u2013 The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) today announced a final rule that clarifies and reinforces long-standing protections and merit system principles for career civil servants.\n\n\u201cCareer federal employees deliver critical services for Americans in every community,\u201d said OPM Director Kiran Ahuja. \u201cThis final rule honors our 2.2 million career civil servants, helping ensure that people are hired and fired based on merit and that they can carry out their duties based on their expertise and not political loyalty. The Biden-Harris Administration is deeply committed to the federal workforce, as these professionals are vital to our national security, our health, our economic prosperity, and much more.\u201d\n\n\u201cNonpartisan civil servants make sure our food is safe and our water is clean. They protect us from national security threats, care for veterans, and support our seniors,\u201d said OPM Deputy Director Rob Shriver. \u201cThis final rule builds on three years of the Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s efforts to strengthen federal agencies and the federal workforce.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Biden-Harris Administration knows that career civil servants are the backbone of the federal workforce and should be able to provide the expertise and experience necessary for the critical functioning of the federal government,\u201d said White House Office of Management and Budget Deputy Director for Management Jason Miller. \u201cAs part of the President\u2019s Management Agenda, it is a clear policy of the United States government to protect, empower, and rebuild the career federal workforce, and this final rule does just that.\u201d\n\nIn the first week of the Biden-Harris Administration, President Biden revoked an Executive Order issued by the previous Administration that risked altering our country\u2019s long-standing merit-based civil service system, by creating new excepted service schedule, known as \u201cSchedule F,\u201d and directing agencies to move potentially large swathes of career employees into this new excepted service status. This attempt would have stripped career civil servants of their civil service protections that ensure that decisions to hire and fire are based on merit, not political considerations.\n\nThe final rule advances these important policy goals by:\n\nClarifying that the status and civil service protections an employee has accrued cannot be taken away by an involuntary move from the competitive service to the excepted service, or from one excepted service schedule to another. Once a career civil servant earns protections, that employee retains them unless waived voluntarily.\n\n\n\nClarifying that the phrase \u201cconfidential, policy determining, policymaking, or policy-advocating\u201d positions\u2014a term of art to describe positions that lack civil service protections\u2014means noncareer, political appointments. This rule prevents that exception from being misapplied to career civil servants.\n\n\n\nEstablishing procedural requirements for moving positions from the competitive service to the excepted service and within the excepted service. This change both creates transparency and establishes an appeals process for federal employees when any such movement is involuntary and characterized as stripping employees of their civil service protections.\n\nOPM issued the final rule after reviewing and responding to more than 4,000 comments submitted by the public in an open and transparent policy-making process. The final rule was posted for Public Inspection on Thursday, April 4 and will be published in the Federal Register on Tuesday, April 9.",

        "text": "2024 Election Uncertainty Could Drive-Fixed Income Outperformance\n2024 Election Uncertainty Could Drive Fixed-Income Outperformance Rising economic policy and geopolitical uncertainty may favor higher quality fixed income in this election year.\n\nReport Highlights The S&P 500 typically performs better January-October in non-election years than in election years, and better in election years after the election is decided. Thus far, this year is atypical.\n\nWe believe the market has yet to fully engage with the election narrative as there is usually more uncertainty over the nominees. But other uncertainties are waiting in the wings.\n\nThe U.S. Economic Policy Uncertainty Index has averaged 17 percent higher in presidential election years than non-election periods, and this year promises to accelerate the recent trend.\n\nThe 2024 election is also occurring in a period of high global geopolitical instability, as indicated by the Geopolitical Risk Index.\n\nIn periods of heightened economic policy and geopolitical uncertainty, higher quality bonds tend to outperform equities and exhibit lower volatility.\n\nHistory also shows that we should not expect the Federal Reserve (Fed) to change its policy execution strategy because of the election, nor should we expect it to tip the scales one way or the other.\n\nWith uncertainty likely to rise and the Fed expected to cut rates later this year, investors should consider increasing allocations to strategies invested in higher quality fixed income. Election Year Equity Returns Typically Stay Subdued But Rise After November Numerous studies have examined how risk assets fare in election years. Our analysis shows that presidential elections have weighed on risk assets in the months leading up to the election. Since 1985, the S&P 500 index has generally performed better between January and October in non-election years than in election years, with an average return of 12 percent in the former compared to less than 1 percent gain in the latter. The market performed better after the elections take place in November, as the removal of uncertainty has had a positive effect. This insight should help investors set realistic expectations for election years to strategize for potential volatility between January and November, and to understand the typically transient impact of elections on markets.\n\nEquities Have Outperformed Their Typical Election Year Trajectory this Year S&P 500 Performance During Election and Non-Election Years Source: Guggenheim Investments, Bloomberg. Data as of 3.31.2024. Past performance does not guarantee future returns.\n\nThat said, this year is atypical. The S&P 500\u2019s current year-to-date performance through January exceeds the typical trajectory for an election year, recording a 5 percent increase and setting new record highs. Absent additional context, the market appears poised to defy historical precedent and deliver strong gains despite a major election looming. It is possible that diminishing fears of a U.S. recession and anticipation of rate cuts are overshadowing the usual election-related uncertainties that tend to constrain risk assets. We believe this year\u2019s market performance can be explained by the inference that the market has yet to fully engage with the election narrative. At this point in a typical presidential election year, there is uncertainty over at least one of the candidates, and in a year in which there is no incumbent running, there is uncertainty over both. This is not the case in 2024. This year, it is highly likely that the election will be a rematch from 2020, and by all accounts the second Biden vs. Trump race will be as tight as the first contest. In a rematch that feels like two incumbents running against each other, election year uncertainty over the nominees is missing, but other uncertainties are waiting in the wings. Once the market begins to focus on these election-related questions, the adjustment could be painful given several dynamics discussed below. The Real Issue for Investors in 2024 Is Economic Policy Uncertainty Policy uncertainty tends to rise during U.S. presidential election periods. If the executive branch transitions from one party to another, or stronger mandates are provided to the party in power, we often see substantial shifts in key policies, including taxation, healthcare, entitlements, and regulations. Since 1985, during U.S. presidential election years, the U.S. Economic Policy Uncertainty Index, which measures uncertainty related to economic policy based on media coverage, has averaged 17 percent higher relative to non-election periods. This trend has become even more pronounced over the past five elections, highlighting the potential for such uncertainty to reach unprecedented levels this year, especially given the upcoming election\u2019s highly contentious nature and the deep polarization on policy issues.\n\nPolicy Uncertainty Tends to Rise During Presidential Elections Economic policy uncertainty in election cycles since 1985 Source: Guggenheim Investments, Haver. Data as of 12.31.2023. The Economic Policy Uncertainty Index tracks geopolitical events and associated risks based on a tally of newspaper articles covering geopolitical tensions.\n\nIf anything, this year promises to accelerate the recent trend, as the country braces for an exceptionally close and rancorous election. President Biden faces an unusually challenging landscape, marked by the highest disapproval rating for a president entering an election year since President Carter in 1980. The growing hyperpolarization of the two major parties also highlights the stark policy disparities between Biden and Trump. The nearby chart shows how wide the gulf is between Democrat and Republican voters on key issues, which suggests possible abrupt shifts in policy expectations. Key issues at stake include U.S. engagement overseas, restrictions on trade and capital flows, immigration, support for Ukraine, and NATO commitments. Moreover, Trump\u2019s legal entanglements and potential social unrest following the election will only add to the prevailing uncertainty.\n\nSharp Partisan Rift over Trade, Immigration, Foreign Relations, and Climate Issues Could Lead to Abrupt Policy U-Turns Source: Guggenheim Investments, Chicago Council on Global Affairs. Data as of 12.31.2023.\n\nHigher Quality Fixed Income Outperformed in Periods of High Uncertainty The policy gulf between the two candidates and parties should lead to more uncertainty. As of January 2024, however, the U.S. Economic Policy Uncertainty Index is below the average reading of historical presidential election years, and more importantly, well below the average reading of the five most recent presidential elections. When economic policy risk is low, risky assets like stocks and below investment-grade credit tend to perform best, which is consistent with the observed cross asset performance in U.S. markets over the last six and 12 months. However, during periods marked by heightened policy uncertainty, which we believe could characterize the next several months leading up to the election, higher quality bonds tend to outperform. Since 1986, in instances where the U.S. Economic Policy Uncertainty Index was more than one standard deviation above its mean, returns for U.S. Treasury securities and investment-grade corporate bonds were, on average, more than 10 percentage points greater than equities, which typically experienced negative returns.\n\nHigher Quality Fixed Income Has Outperformed When Policy Uncertainty Is High Economic policy uncertainty and asset class annualized returns since 1985 Source: Guggenheim Investments, Bloomberg, Haver. Data as of 12.31.2023. Past performance does not guarantee future returns.\n\nMoreover, we believe higher quality fixed income typically offers the most predictable returns when uncertainty over election outcomes and economic policies is high, based on standard deviation. In the same periods with elevated policy uncertainty, investment-grade corporate bonds and Treasurys not only demonstrated superior performance but also lower volatility. This outperformance of higher quality fixed income may indicate a preference among investors for more predictable returns in times when a clear view of future policies is elusive. Additionally, the lack of clarity around government policies can constrict the economy\u2019s capital supply and increase friction in financial markets, ultimately exerting a drag on economic growth and returns of riskier assets.\n\nHigher Quality Fixed Income Demonstrates Lower Volatility of Returns in Times of Unpredictability Economic policy uncertainty and asset class annualized volatility since 1985 Source: Guggenheim Investments, Bloomberg, Haver. Data as of 12.31.2023. Past performance does not guarantee future returns.\n\nIn sum, during periods of higher economic policy uncertainty, higher quality fixed income has historically generated both higher returns and lower volatility.\n\nAverage Return vs. Average Volatility in Different Economic Policy Uncertainty Regimes Source: Guggenheim Investments, Bloomberg, Haver. Data as of 12.31.2023. Past performance does not guarantee future returns.\n\nRising Geopolitical Uncertainty May Also Help Higher Quality Bonds Beyond simmering domestic uncertainty in the United States, the forthcoming U.S. election is occurring in the context of growing global geopolitical instability. For instance, bipartisan animosity towards China may prompt both parties to harden their positions. When combined with a new hardline Taiwanese president aiming to secure stronger U.S. security guarantees, this situation could lead to a standoff between the United States and China in the Taiwan Strait. Furthermore, the razor thin margins in the presidential campaign create an opportunity for foreign countries to capitalize on Biden\u2019s vulnerabilities in the leadup to the election. Iran might use Biden\u2019s reluctance for escalation to counteract the bolstering of U.S.-Israel security cooperation against Tehran, potentially orchestrating attacks through proxies. Similarly, Russia could exploit Biden\u2019s concern over energy costs by weaponizing oil and gas to weaken the Democrats, aiming to diminish U.S. support for Ukraine. The interplay between domestic electoral dynamics and international strategic maneuvers underscores the multifaceted challenges facing U.S. economic policy and national security. Any geopolitical upheavals, particularly in oil production or chip supply chains, could profoundly destabilize the U.S. and global economies. Again, an environment with elevated geopolitical risks, as indicated by the news coverage-based Economic Policy Uncertainty Index, may also favor investment-grade corporate bonds and U.S. Treasurys.\n\nGeopolitical Tensions Generally Weigh on Riskier Assets Geopolitical uncertainty* and asset returns (annualized six-month trailing %) Source: Guggenheim Investments, Bloomberg, Haver. Data as of 12.31.2023. *The Economic Policy Uncertainty Index tracks geopolitical events and associated risks based on a tally of newspaper articles covering geopolitical tensions. Past performance does not guarantee future returns.\n\nInvestment Implications As we approach the presidential election in November, the unveiling of candidates\u2019 political agendas could introduce a layer of uncertainty that has the potential to affect market performance, particularly for riskier assets that tend to falter amid heightened economic policy uncertainty. Failing to account for the unique and competitive nature of this election cycle might result in inadequate asset allocation in investment portfolios, overweighting unnecessary risk and missing out on the advantages of diversification. With policy risk set to rise and the Fed expected to cut rates later this year, investors should consider increasing allocations to strategies invested in higher quality fixed income, given its track record of outperformance during periods of elevated uncertainty.\n\nDispelling the Myth that the Fed Abstains from Policy Moves During Presidential Election Years Election years often bring concerns that the Fed would refrain from making significant policy moves. After all, the Fed is politically independent and a rate hike or rate cut could carry implications of a political motive. History shows that this is not the case. Indeed, the Fed has adjusted policy at a similar frequency and in similar directions in election years and non-election years. Quarterly Fed Policy Moves During Election and Non-Election Years Zooming in on just presidential election years, the Fed has also shown no particular disinclination to make a monetary policy change. Indeed, the Fed has moved rates during 14 of the last 16 presidential elections since 1956. Perhaps more importantly, these changes have not made a difference to the outcome. In a year in which the Fed is expected to cut rates, we should not expect the Fed to change its policy execution strategy because of the election, nor should we expect it to tip the scales one way or the other.

In general, the value of a fixed-income security falls when interest rates rise and rises when interest rates fall. Longer term bonds are more sensitive to interest rate changes and subject to greater volatility than those with shorter maturities. During periods of declining rates, the interest rates on floating rate securities generally reset downward and their value is unlikely to rise to the same extent as comparable fixed rate securities. High yield and unrated debt securities are at a greater risk of default than investment grade bonds and may be less liquid, which may increase volatility. Investors in asset-backed securities, including mortgage-backed securities and collateralized loan obligations (\u201cCLOs\u201d), generally receive payments that are part interest and part return of principal. These payments may vary based on the rate loans are repaid. Some asset-backed securities may have structures that make their reaction to interest rates and other factors difficult to predict, making their prices volatile and they are subject to liquidity and valuation risk. CLOs bear similar risks to investing in loans directly, such as credit, interest rate, counterparty, prepayment, liquidity, and valuation risks. Loans are often below investment grade, may be unrated, and typically offer a fixed or floating interest rate. The Bloomberg U.S. Corporate Bond Index measures the investment grade, fixed-rate, taxable corporate bond market. It includes USD-denominated securities publicly issued by U.S. and non-U.S. industrial, utility, and financial issuers. The Bloomberg U.S. Corporate High Yield Bond Index measures the USD-denominated non-investment grade, fixed-rate, taxable corporate bonds. Securities are classified as high yield if the middle rating of Moody\u2019s, Fitch, and S&P is Bal/BB+/BB+ or below. The index excludes emerging market debt.

        "text": "Four Filipino Americans Win 2024 Primary Elections in California \u2013 Asia Matters for America\nOn March 6, 2024, four Filipino Americans emerged as leading candidates in the primary elections for California Senate, California\u2019s 52nd District State Assembly, Los Angeles\u2019 14th District City Council, and San Diego\u2019s mayoral race. Their feats demonstrate the growing presence of Filipino American voices in the United States and the need for more diverse representation at local and state levels.\n\nIntroduction\n\nFilipino Americans have been an integral part of California\u2019s social and economic history for generations. In the 1920s, thousands of Filipino agricultural workers and service laborers immigrated to the \"Golden State,\u201d contributing to the development of the West Coast and bringing along their rich traditions and cultural pride. Today, over four million live across California, making Filipino Americans the third largest ethnic population in the state.\n\nDespite their monumental impacts and growing presence, these populations have historically been underrepresented in American politics. Though over two million Filipino Americans are eligible voters in California alone, few Filipino Americans occupy public offices in the state. For instance, there has never been a person of Filipino descent in the California Senate. However, some politicians this year are taking strides to change this reality and uplift the voices of Filipino voters.\n\nOn March 5, 2024, California held its primary election to determine which candidates will advance to the November general election for local, state, and federal offices. Notably, California implements a Top-Two Primary system, where all contenders for \u201cvoter-nominated\u201d office positions are listed on one ballot, regardless of party affiliation. The results of the primary only allow the leading two candidates to run in November, but these rules do not apply to the presidential election or local offices.\n\nSignificantly, four Filipino American politicians\u2014Jessica Caloza, Christopher Cabaldon, Ysabel Jurado, and Todd Gloria\u2014raced to the forefront of their respective primary elections in March, increasing representation at the local and state levels.\n\nThe Four Candidates\n\nJessica Caloza\n\nElection details: As the only Asian American and first Filipina running, Jessica Caloza won the California 52nd District State Assembly primary election, securing 30.1% of the votes. District 52 includes a large portion of Los Angeles and the southern region of Glendale.\n\nBackground: Originally born in Quezon City, Philippines, Caloza has a long history in the public sector. She worked as an education policy advisor during Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, and she served as the first Filipino American commissioner on the Los Angeles Board of Public Works. She also assisted California Attorney General Rob Bonta as his Chief of Staff.\n\nCampaign platform for Filipino American communities: She has focused a portion of her campaign on bolstering the voices of Filipino Americans in local government. In a TikTok video, she said, \u201c... in LA County, we have the largest number of Filipinos outside of the Philippines . . . and Filipino Americans in LA, in California, and in the United States are so powerful.\u201d\n\nChristopher Cabaldon\n\nElection details: Although Christopher Cabaldon was the second runner-up in the California Senate District 3 primary election with 26.6% of the votes, he will advance to the general election in November. District 3 includes Napa, Solano, Yolo, Sonoma, Sacramento, and Contra Costa counties.\n\nBackground: Cabaldon started his public service career in the Yolo County health commission and city council. Before his current campaign, he was the West Sacramento Mayor from 1998 to 2020. During his term, he was appointed to the National Advisory Board of College Promise to assist with educational initiatives.\n\nCampaign platform for Filipino American communities: Cabaldon promised during the primary election to address anti-Asian hate and support Filipino-owned businesses.\n\nYsabel Jurado\n\nElection details: Running for the Los Angeles City Council\u2019s 14th District seat, Ysabel Jurado secured the most votes in the primary election. Though a close-call election, polls indicated she received 24.52% of the votes. The 14th District encompasses Northeast Los Angeles, Downtown Los Angeles, El Sereno, Lincoln Heights, and Boyle Heights.\n\nBackground: A child of undocumented Filipino immigrants, Jurado is a tenants rights attorney. She has never held a public office position, but she is the first Filipino American woman to run for city council in the 14th District.\n\nCampaign platform for Filipino American communities: Jurado is focused on housing security and public safety for minority populations, including Filipino locals.\n\nTodd Gloria\n\nElection details: As the incumbent, Todd Gloria gained 50.9% of the votes in San Diego\u2019s mayoral primary election.\n\nBackground: Gloria previously served in the San Diego City Council and in California\u2019s 78th State Assembly. When elected as mayor of San Diego in 2020, he became the first Filipino American mayor to govern a US city with a population of over a million.\n\nCampaign platform for Filipino American communities: Gloria used his previous term as mayor to create Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) initiatives, such as the Asian-Pacific Islander Advisory Group. His campaign is focused on continuing and expanding these efforts.\n\nThe Future of Politics and Filipino Americans\n\nThe 2024 California General Election is set for November 5, 2024, and county elections offices will send vote-by-mail ballots to all registered California voters on October 7, 2024.\n\nThough the primary election results do not guarantee the success of the four individual campaigns, they do signify a growing trend of AAPI influence in various levels of government. In 1980, around 160 officials of Asian descent were in public offices across the United States, and by 2016, that number rose to 463. The emergence of Jessica Caloza, Christopher Cabaldon, Ysabel Jurado, and Todd Gloria is a testament to the AAPI community\u2019s burgeoning impact on the public sector and the significance of Filipino American representation in local and state offices.\n\n-------------------------\n\nDenise Sievert Geronimo is a participant in the Young Professionals Program at the East-West Center in Washington.

        "text": "Political activity: Federal law, DOD rules dictate employee do\u2019s and don\u2019ts\nDisplaying a political bumper sticker or banner in one\u2019s workspace is a violation of federal law, but that doesn\u2019t mean federal employees are barred from all political activities, the Defense Logistics Agency\u2019s ethics program manager said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s actually a lot that people can do although there are some restrictions on what\u2019s acceptable and where those things can take place,\u201d Associate General Counsel Maria Delimata said.\n\nThe bumper sticker not allowed in federal workspaces, for example, can be displayed on a personal vehicle parked in a government parking lot \u2013 with a caveat: Only one sticker is allowed per vehicle.\n\nPolitical activities by federal employees are regulated by the Hatch Act, which breaks the workforce into two categories: less restricted and further restricted. Most of DLA\u2019s workforce is less restricted, Delimata said, while the rest \u2013 mostly members of the senior executive service \u2013 are further restricted.\n\nPolitical activities include any action directed toward the success or failure of a political party, partisan political group or candidate for partisan political office. The Hatch Act doesn\u2019t pertain to voting, however, which Delimata said all employees can and should do.\n\n\u201cEverybody, regardless of which category they\u2019re in, can give money to a political party or candidate, go to rallies, sign nominating petitions and do things like follow political social media pages using personal accounts,\u201d Delimata said. \u201cBut the main takeaway here is that they can\u2019t do these things on government time or in government space.\u201d\n\nWhile employees may \u201clike\u201d a political ad while on their lunch break if they\u2019re working from home, they can\u2019t if having lunch in a government building, whether they\u2019re in a workspace or a location such as a break room, gym or cafeteria.\n\nSome acceptable activities for less restricted employees while off duty and away from a government facility include:\n\nVolunteering to work on the campaign of a candidate running for political office.\n\nServing as an election judge for a city or county.\n\nWorking or standing at the polls for a candidate on Election Day.\n\nWearing clothing or accessories bearing political slogans or statements.\n\nWriting a letter to an editor or presenting a speech, in a personal capacity, that endorses a candidate running for office.\n\nThe main differences for further restricted employees include not being permitted to work on political campaigns, or work or stand at the polls for a candidate on Election Day.\n\nViolations should be reported to ethics counselors at DLA major subordinate commands or DLA Headquarters. Cases are sent to the U.S. Office of Special Counsel for investigation.\n\n\u201cNine times out of 10, it\u2019s not a violation,\u201d Delimata said.\n\nThe Hatch Act was created in 1939 to protect federal employees from political coercion in the workplace, to ensure employees are advanced based on merit rather than political affiliation, and to ensure activities of the federal government are carried out in a nonpartisan fashion.\n\nServicemembers\n\nGuidelines for military members are outlined in Defense Department Directive 1344.10, \u201cPolitical Activities by Members of the Armed Forces on Active Duty.\u201d Most restrictions for further restricted employees also apply to servicemembers, who must avoid appearances that their political activities imply DOD sponsorship, approval, or endorsement of a political candidate, campaign, or cause.\n\nMilitary members are also barred from giving political speeches or serving in any official capacity of political groups. And all federal employees and servicemembers are prohibited from soliciting, accepting or receiving contributions.\n\nConsequences of violating federal and DOD laws on political activities range from a 30-day suspension without pay to removal from federal service. Military members are subject to disciplinary action.\n\nMore information on the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts of political activity is available at DLA\u2019s Hatch Act Guidance page.",

        "text": "Presidential Candidate Profile: Donald Trump\u2019s record on animal protection\nWith the Super Tuesday primary elections behind us, and the Democratic and Republican Party nominations nearly settled, we wanted to provide a review of the animal welfare records of President Biden and President Trump.\n\nAs the leading voice in animal protection politics, we provide an objective analysis of candidates, free from judgements based on political party affiliation or on the candidates\u2019 positions on any other issues. HSLF evaluates candidates for political office at all levels of government on their records and commitments concerning animal protection, as well as on their electability.\n\nGiven Donald Trump\u2019s status as the presumptive Republican nominee in the 2024 presidential election, a full review of the Trump Administration\u2019s animal protection record between 2017-2020 is warranted. When we at Humane Society Legislative Fund published our first analysis of President Trump\u2019s legacy on animal welfare, he had 6 months left in office; a time which resulted in both significant gains and losses for our nation\u2019s animals.\n\nOn the positive side, President Trump was responsible for signing multiple landmark animal protection measures into law. He wasted no time signing the Preventing Animal Cruelty and Torture (PACT) Act, designating certain acts of extreme animal cruelty as felony crimes. He authorized the federal omnibus package of 2020 which included the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Act, requiring the oversight and strict regulation of practices in the horseracing industry. And he also signed the 2018 Farm Bill, which effectively banned the slaughter or trade in dog and cat meat, funded a grant program to provide transitional sheltering options for domestic violence survivors fleeing with pets, and outlawed the barbaric practice of animal fighting in the U.S. territories.\n\n\n\nYet, over the course of his term, the Trump Administration often favored special interests over wildlife. President Trump himself tweeted that \u201cbig-game\u201d trophy hunting was a \u201chorror show,\u201d which he believed did not support the conservation of elephants or any other animal. Notwithstanding, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service lifted existing Obama-era bans on the import of elephant and lion trophies from certain African countries, deciding to approve imports on a case-by-case basis. In these matters, the FWS chose to cater to the interests of wealthy trophy hunters and groups like the NRA and Safari Club International.\n\nThe Department of the Interior under President Trump overturned a rule prohibiting controversial hunting and killing methods on 20 million acres of National Preserve lands in Alaska, and the administration opened up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to vast oil drilling. The FWS carried out the largest expansion of hunting and fishing opportunities in U.S. history, opening the gates to 2.1 million acres at 88 wildlife refuges and hatcheries. Moreover, the FWS removed Endangered Species Act protections for grizzly bears in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem and gray wolves across the lower 48 states, though both actions were subsequently overturned by courts.\n\nOne area in which the Trump Administration showed great promise involved the use of animals in research and testing. President Trump\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency embraced a vision of a future free of animal testing, releasing a plan to promote the development and implementation of alternative product testing methods, and then announcing a goal to end all animal testing on mammals for chemicals and pesticides by 2035.\n\nThings were challenging at the U.S. Department of Agriculture under President Trump. In the administration\u2019s earliest days, the agency instituted a website data purge of important enforcement records related to horse soring, dog breeding operations, and related facilities regulated by the Animal Welfare Act (AWA). These crucial records were only restored after years of fighting by HSLF, and due to an express directive by Congress. The agency also cut back drastically on the number of AWA citations and enforcement actions for enterprises like puppy mills and roadside zoos. At the same time, the USDA did finalize a positive licensing rule, strengthening some standards for USDA licensing of dog breeders.\n\nThe Trump Administration\u2019s record on farmed animal welfare was bleak. The USDA repealed an Obama-era rule on organic farming, which had set basic standards of care for the national organic label. The agency took steps to ensure that all beef, pork, and poultry slaughterhouses and processing plants remained open and fulfilled orders throughout the COVID-19 pandemic\u2014which proved harmful and even fatal to slaughterhouse workers. And the USDA even ruled that these slaughterhouses could increase their line speeds, allowing them to operate at a dangerously high pace. Moreover, the EPA chose to deny a petition to list Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) as sources of pollution under the Clean Air Act, exempting massive factory farms from reporting emissions. And perhaps most importantly, the Trump Administration filed an amicus brief seeking to overturn the nation\u2019s strongest farm animal protection law in California\u2019s Proposition 12.\n\nThe Trump Administration also failed the horses subjected to the cruel practice of \u201csoring,\u201d by unlawfully withdrawing a USDA agency rule years in the making\u2014the rule would have strengthened the USDA\u2019s Horse Protection Act regulations by banning the use of cruel horse soring devices, as well as ending the failed system of industry self-policing.\n\nDuring his time in office, President Trump\u2019s agencies worked to change the entire regulatory landscape concerning animals. The Endangered Species Act became a tool used primarily to take federal protections away, rather than to grant them, as a series of rules were finalized making it harder to achieve federal protections for endangered and threatened species in need. Yet, the administration also worked to secure significant protections for whales, leatherback and loggerhead turtles, whitetip sharks, bison, service animals, and NIH research animals who were made eligible for retirement as adoptable pets.\n\nAs with those that came before it, the Trump Administration\u2019s legacy on animal protection is mixed. We celebrated several big wins for animals. But overall, the damage it wrought to wildlife, farmed animals, and beyond was significant.\n\nOn the road to November, please remember to update your voter registration, request an absentee ballot, and take other steps to participate in this critically important election.\n\nBe sure to also check out our analysis of President Biden\u2019s record on animal protection in yesterday\u2019s blog.",

        "text": "Election 2024: China\u2019s Efforts to Interfere in the U.S. Presidential Election\nRussia opened a new chapter in geopolitical competition in 2016 when it used social media to interfere in the U.S. presidential election. Whether that effort affected the election\u2019s outcome can be debated. What seems beyond debate given Russia\u2019s interference attempts in 2020 and again this year is that the Kremlin thinks that meddling works.\n\nNow China looks to be following suit. In February, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued a threat assessment stating: \u201cBeijing is expanding its global covert influence posture to better support the CCP\u2019s goals. The PRC aims to sow doubts about U.S. leadership, undermine democracy, and extend Beijing\u2019s influence.\u201d This week the New York Times reported that \u201ccovert Chinese accounts are masquerading online as American supporters of former President Donald J. Trump, promoting conspiracy theories, stoking domestic divisions and attacking President Biden ahead of the election in November.\u201d This campaign, known as \u201cspamouflage,\u201d has prompted Meta to take down thousands of fake Facebook accounts operating in China.\n\nChina\u2019s interference efforts mark a significant shift in policy. In 2021, the U.S. intelligence community concluded that China opted not to interfere in the 2020 election: \u201cWe assess that China did not deploy interference efforts and considered but did not deploy influence efforts intended to change the outcome of the US Presidential election. We have high confidence in this judgment.\u201d The intelligence community attributed the Chinese decision to a calculation that the costs of being caught meddling outweighed the potential benefits. Likely influencing that judgment was the assessment \u201cthat Russia\u2019s efforts to interfere in the 2016 election significantly damaged Moscow\u2019s position and relationship with the United States.\u201d\n\nThe Water's Edge James M.

Beijing may have decided that a second Trump presidency would better serve its interests than a second Biden presidency, whether because Trump would be more open to cutting a deal, less likely to have an effective foreign policy, or more likely to antagonize U.S. allies. Conversely, Beijing may not see much difference between the two candidates given the broad consensus in the United States that China is America\u2019s primary adversary. Rather than chose between \u201ctwo bowls of poison,\u201d Beijing\u2019s goal may simply be to weaken American democracy, and hence its ability to act coherently abroad, by inflaming political divisions.\n\nAs with Russia\u2019s meddling, it\u2019s difficult to say whether China\u2019s interference will affect the election outcome. The Biden administration, however, isn\u2019t taking any chances. Biden warned Xi Jinping in a phone call this week against interfering in the U.S. election. The fact that call was necessary points to a problem. Last November in San Francisco, Xi promised Biden that China wouldn\u2019t meddle in the U.S. election. That promise now looks hollow. The question is what Biden will do if Chinese interference efforts continue.\n\nStay tuned.\n\nCampaign Update\n\nConnecticut, New York, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin held primaries this week. The results were either meaningless because the nominees of both parties have been decided\u2014or a sign that both nominees have substantial problems heading into the general election. Take your pick. Turnout in all four states was understandably low given that the race of the nomination is over. Nonetheless, between 11 and 14 percent of Republicans who voted in all four states opted for Nikki Haley. Meanwhile, 12 percent of Connecticut Democrats, 15 percent of Rhode Island Democrats, and 8 percent of Wisconsin Democrats vote for \u201cuncommitted\u201d or \u201cuninstructed.\u201d\n\nNebraska Gov. Jim Pillen announced his support this week for awarding all of the state\u2019s electoral votes to the statewide winner of the popular vote. Back in 1991, Nebraska decided to award one electoral vote to the winner of the popular vote in each of the state\u2019s congressional districts. Maine is the only other state to follow this practice. Whether Nebraska returns to the winner-takes-all rule that the other forty-eight states follow could be pivotal to the 2024 election. In 2020, Biden won the Nebraska congressional district centered around Omaha. If he loses Arizona, Georgia, and Nevada this November but wins every other state he won four years ago, that single Nebraska electoral vote would give him a 270 to 268 victory in the Electoral College. Without it, the outcome of the election would be decided by the new House of Representatives. Nebraska\u2019s legislators voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday night to reject a move to change the law. The bill is unlikely to receive another hearing before the legislative session concludes on April 18. However, Governor Pillen could call a special legislative session to consider revising Nebraska\u2019s electoral rules.\n\nThe self-described centrist group No Labels has pulled the plug on its effort to run a third-party ticket. In a statement, the group wrote: \u201cNo Labels has always said we would only offer our ballot line to a ticket if we could identify candidates with a credible path to winning the White House. No such candidates emerged, so the responsible course of action is for us to stand down.\u201d\n\nThe Candidates in Their Own Words\n\nLast month, Trump supporters accused Democrats and the national news media over distorting Trump\u2019s use of the word \u201cbloodbath\u201d in a campaign rally in Ohio. They insisted that the former president was not inciting violence but only using a metaphor describe what lies ahead for the U.S. automotive industry if Biden succeeds in persuading Americans to buy electric vehicles. Trump, however, seems not to have gotten the message. On Tuesday, he told a campaign rally in Grand Rapids that Biden had caused a \u201cborder bloodbath\u201d during a campaign rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan. It didn\u2019t appear to be a slip of the tongue. Trump was standing in front of a sign saying: \u201cStop Biden\u2019s Border Bloodbath.\u201d\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Trump Michigan Video Pause Video Pause Trump Michigan Embed\n\nTrump also responded to Democratic complaints that his language describing immigrants was dehumanizing. Not surprisingly, Trump didn\u2019t back down: \u201cDemocrats said please don\u2019t call them \u2018animals.\u2019 I said, \u2018no, they\u2019re not humans, they\u2019re animals.\u2019\u201d\n\nTrump appeared on Hugh Hewitt\u2019s syndicated national radio show yesterday. The former president expanded on comments he made last week that seemed to criticize Israel\u2019s war against Hamas. Trump agreed with Hewitt\u2019s characterization that he remained \u201c100% with Israel.\u201d Trump added:\n\nI\u2019m not sure that I\u2019m loving the way they\u2019re [the Israelis] doing it, because you\u2019ve got to have victory. You have to have a victory, and it\u2019s taking a long time. And the other thing is I hate, they put out tapes all the time. Every night, they\u2019re releasing tapes of a building falling down. They shouldn\u2019t be releasing tapes like that. They\u2019re doing, that\u2019s why they\u2019re losing the PR war. They, Israel is absolutely losing the PR war.\n\nTrump concluded by saying that the Israelis have \u201cgot to finish what they started, and they\u2019ve got to finish it fast, and we have to get on with life.\u201d\n\nWhat the Pundits Are Saying\n\nFiveThirtyEight.com\u2019s Nathaniel Rakich pulled together polling numbers showing that the Biden-Trump re-run isn\u2019t the most unpopular of the last twelve presidential elections. That distinction remains with the 2016 race that pitted Trump against Hillary Clinton. The average net favorability rating\u2014that is, the favorability ratings minus the unfavorability ratings\u2014of that pair was -18 points. Biden-Trump the rematch is currently standing at -12 points. The most popular pairing? George H. W. Bush and Michael Dukakis back in 1988. Their net favorability rating was +20 points.\n\nPolitico\u2019s Lara Seligman, Stuart Lau, and Pau McLeary wrote that the Biden administration is working with European allies to find ways to ensure that weapons continue to flow to Ukraine even if Trump wins in November. One of the proposals to \u201cTrump-proof\u201d support for Ukraine is to shift leadership of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group from the United States to NATO. In the view of one expert, putting the group \u201cunder NATO kind of isolates it from a Trump presidency, or even from a U.S. that might get distracted by China and can\u2019t keep it going or can\u2019t get his own funding act together.\u201d\n\nWhat the Polls Show\n\nFamiliarity may breed contempt, but absence does not necessarily make the heart grow fonder. That seems to be the takeaway of a Gallup poll released this week. Gallup found that ratings of Biden on a range of character qualities such as \u201cis likeable\u201d and \u201cis honest and trustworthy\u201d have fallen across the board since 2020. His ratings fell by at least six points in every category. The biggest decline was on \u201ccan manage the government effectively.\u201d That rating fell by thirteen points. Conversely, how Americans rate Trump on those same characteristics remained more or less unchanged.\n\nThe Campaign Schedule\n\nTrump\u2019s criminal trial in New York state court for falsifying business records to hide his relationship with Stormy Daniels is set to begin in ten days (April 15, 2024).\n\nThe oral arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court on Trump\u2019s claim that he has blanket immunity for all his actions while president are set to begin in twenty days (April 25, 2024).\n\nThe Republican National Convention opens in Milwaukee in 101 days (July 15, 2024).\n\nThe Democratic National Convention opens in Chicago in 136 days (August 19, 2024).\n\nElection Day is 214 days away.\n\nInauguration Day is 290 days away.\n\nSinet Adous assisted in the preparation of this post\n\nThis publication is part of the Diamonstein-Spielvogel Project on the Future of Democracy.",

        "text": "Biden v Trump: What is at stake in the 2024 US presidential election?\nOn 5 November 2024, up to 161 million American voters will go to the polls to vote for the next president of the United States \u2013 and will be faced with a choice between the same two candidates that stood in 2020. Joe Biden, the incumbent, will again face Donald Trump \u2013 the former president who lost to Biden in 2020. But polling suggests many voters are less than enthused by the choice. Non-MAGA Republicans feeling queasy about the prospect of Trump \u2013 who is still facing a pile of legal challenges \u2013 returning to the White House, and many Democrats wonder if Biden, who would be 86 at the end of a second presidential term, is the best possible candidate.\n\nSo what are we to make of American politics? How does their system work? What will happen in the election? What could this mean for the UK? And is politics in the US a guide to what might happen in the UK?\n\nOn this week\u2019s Expert Factor, the team take a deep breath and take a deep dive into US politics. Mark Landler, London Bureau Chief of the New York Times and a former White House correspondent, joins Hannah, Paul and Anand, who dials in from Boston, to try and make sense of a presidential election that will have consequences across the world.\n\nTHE EXPERT FACTOR is the podcast for people who haven\u2019t had enough of experts. Each week the directors of three leading and respected think tanks \u2013 Paul Johnson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, Hannah White of the Institute for Government, and Anand Menon of UK in a Changing Europe \u2013 get together to discuss, debate and explain the big questions and themes that will shape the election \u2013 and the political landscape for years to come.",

Since 2006, the study has interviewed more than a half-million Americans to capture their views on contemporary policy debates, their engagement in political and social life, and their vote choices in federal and state elections. The study is a collaborative enterprise partially funded by the National Science Foundation and involving the participation of hundreds of scholars and students across dozens of academic institutions across the country.\n\nDuring election years, the survey consists of interviews with more than 50,000 American adults before and after the election. During the pre-election wave, respondents answer questions about their general political attitudes, various demographic factors, assessments of policies being debated in Congress, political information, and vote intentions. In the post-election wave, respondents answer questions about how they voted in the election and other ways in which they have recently engaged in political and social life. In non-election years, the survey consists of a single wave conducted in the fall.\n\nThe data from the CES are used widely by researchers, journalists, and members of the public to understand American elections and public opinion. Few, if any, data infrastructure ventures in the discipline have participation from as many institutions and scholars as CES has facilitated.",

        "text": "Capitol rioters' families draw hope from Trump's promise of pardons\nCapitol rioters' families draw hope from Trump's promise of pardons\n\nBBC\n\nEvery night since August 2022, a small crowd has gathered outside the Washington DC Central Jail, through frigid winter nights and under spring rain, to protest against the US justice system.\n\nThe protesters outside the red-brick buildings of the facility pray, discuss the news, and broadcast telephone calls with prisoners inside the jail, where hundreds of accused or convicted rioters have been held in the three years since the 6 January 2021 storming of the Capitol.\n\nIn recent months, as Donald Trump has gripped the Republican Party's presidential nomination, the protesters have taken heart from the ex-president's vocal public support for those who attacked Congress.\n\nAt rallies, Mr Trump plays a version of the national anthem recorded by the J6 Prison Choir - an anonymous group of prisoners thought to include several violent offenders.\n\nOn Wednesday, he posted a video of the song on his Truth Social account, describing them as \"January 6th hostages\" - a term he has increasingly used in reference to the rioters.\n\nOn a recent chilly evening, Micki Witthoeft was one of a handful of protesters and live-streamers outside the jail. The mother of Ashli Babbitt, a 35-year-old military veteran who was shot and killed by law enforcement after breaching the Capitol building, Ms Witthoeft said she had received a call from Mr Trump just that day in which he promised to \"do his best\" for the prisoners should he return to office.\n\n\"President Trump is a man of his word,\" she said. \"We don't really think everybody on January 6 was innocent of all things, but we just want them to be adequately and accurately charged and sentenced.\"\n\nProtesters including Micki Witthoeft (left) outside the Washington DC Central Jail\n\nWhen a mob of Mr Trump's supporters breached the US Capitol to try to stop the certification of Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election, the images of police and security officers under attack and armed rioters surging into the centre of American democracy shocked the country.\n\nAround 140 police officers were assaulted, according to justice department figures. In total, more than 1,350 people have been arrested since then. Nearly 30 January 6 inmates are reported to be currently held in the DC jail, most of them charged with assaulting officers.\n\nAs part of his re-election bid, Mr Trump has promised to pardon many of the January 6 rioters but has never detailed the specific criteria he might use.\n\nAt times he has distinguished between non-violent rioters and those who \"got out of control\", but his focus at campaign events largely centres on unsubstantiated claims that both he and they are victims of political persecution.\n\nWhile political strategists say the focus could hurt Mr Trump electorally - particularly among independent and moderate voters he must win over to defeat Joe Biden - they see the messaging as a bid to keep his loyal base of supporters motivated.\n\nWatch: Rendition of Star-Spangled Banner performed by January 6 rioters plays at Trump rally.\n\n\"They've been treated terribly and very unfairly,\" Mr Trump said last month at a rally in Dayton, Ohio, going on to describe the prisoners as \"unbelievable patriots\".\n\nIn his own words: How Trump's January 6th language evolved\n\n7 January 2021: \"I am outraged by the violence, lawlessness and mayhem\u2026 to those who broke the law, you will pay.\" (Televised speech)\n\nJuly 2021: \"There was such love at that rally... the crowd was unbelievable and I mentioned the word love, the love in the air, I've never seen anything like it.\" (Fox News interview)\n\nJanuary 2022: \"If I run and if I win, we will treat those people from Jan 6 fairly\u2026 And if it requires pardons we will give them pardons.\" (Texas rally)\n\nMay 2023: \"I am inclined to pardon many of them. I can't say for every single one because a couple of them, probably, they got out of control\u2026 And it'll be very early on.\" (CNN town hall discussion)\n\nNovember 2023: \"I call them the J6 hostages, not prisoners.\" (Texas rally)\n\n12 March 2024: \"My first acts as your next President will be to Close the Border, DRILL, BABY, DRILL, and Free the January 6 Hostages being wrongfully imprisoned!\" (Truth Social post)\n\n16 March 2024: \"You see the spirit from the hostages, and that's what they are, is hostages. They've been treated terribly and very unfairly.\" (Ohio rally)\n\n3 April 2024: \"January 6th hostages with President Donald J. Trump\", with a video featuring the J6 Prison Choir song (Truth Social post)\n\nMr Trump's attacks on the legal system for alleged political bias against the Capitol rioters echo his public outbursts about his own legal travails.\n\nHe faces four criminal indictments, including one that accuses him of conspiring to overturn the 2020 election. And embracing the 6 January defendants, observers say, bolsters his claim to supporters that the legal system is \"rigged\".\n\n\"The political prisoners narrative seems to be an effort to frame the Jan 6 attack as a lawful political protest,\" said Barbara McQuade, a University of Michigan law professor and author of the book Attack from Within: How Disinformation is Sabotaging America. And Mr Trump's base want to believe in him and his narrative about the legal system, she said, even though it's \"a con\".\n\nSeveral Trump supporters told the BBC that they felt sentencing of the rioters was too harsh.\n\nScott Nolan, a self-described conservative voter in Reston, Virginia, called Mr Trump's statements \"overblown, but not entirely incorrect\". He said he believed the president was right to say that Antifa and Black Lives Matter protesters had been treated differently.\n\nPolling, however, suggests the idea that the Capitol rioters are being treated unfairly is broadly rejected by most Americans.\n\nA Washington Post-University of Maryland survey in December 2023 found that nearly three-quarters of respondents believed punishments had either been \"fair\" or \"not harsh enough\". And a recent survey by Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found two-thirds of Americans thought the riot was \"very\" or \"extremely\" violent.\n\nBoth polls showed sharp differences between Republicans and Democrats.\n\nWatch: Officer Harry Dunn is still traumatised by the attack on the Capitol\n\nGunner Ramer, political director of Republican Accountability, a political action committee opposed to Mr Trump, said the campaign rhetoric about January 6 \"hostages\" could be particularly damaging among voters that might ultimately determine the outcome of the election.\n\n\"Trump talking about 'political prisoners' activates victimhood grievance politics and connects with Republican primary voters,\" he said. \"But when you're talking about swing voters - those who supported Trump in 2016 but not in 2020 - they are absolutely repulsed by January 6.\"\n\nMr Trump has not been specific about why he believes the rioters were treated unfairly. Nor has he been specifically critical of conditions in the DC jail, which has long been the subject of complaints and lawsuits.\n\nSome of the people given the longest 6 January sentences, for felonies such as seditious conspiracy - plotting against the government - did not directly participate in vandalism or physical violence. Instead they were prosecuted for co-ordinating attempts to stop the vote and bringing dozens of their members to the Capitol that day.\n\nMr Trump's campaign did not respond to requests for comment, but a spokeswoman recently told the Washington Post: \"President Trump will restore justice for all Americans who have been unfairly treated by Joe Biden's two-tier system of justice.\"\n\nAnalysis by the Washington Post that compared sentences in Capitol riot cases to national sentencing guidelines suggests they received lighter punishments than those usually applied. In two-thirds of Capitol riot cases, judges handed out sentences below federal guidelines. Nationally they go below the guidelines in about half of all cases, the paper reported.\n\nThe protesters outside the DC jail agreed that a blanket pardon for all of the rioters wasn't necessarily warranted. But they hoped that most would be freed or have their criminal records expunged.\n\n\"Our hope is that [Trump] wins and gets back in office,\" said Tamara Jackson, a Texas woman whose husband Brian pleaded guilty in February to felony assault charges, and whose brother-in-law Andrew was recently sentenced to a year of weekends in jail. \"Them [the detainees] coming home is obviously the goal.\"\n\nGetty Images Trump supporters at the US Capitol during the 6 January riot\n\nMany of Mr Trump's political allies have echoed his support for the jailed rioters. But there has been pushback from some leading Republicans that have broken publicly with their party's nominee.\n\nMike Pence, who served as Mr Trump's vice-president, told CBS News last month that he thought it was \"very unfortunate\" that the former president had begun to use the term \"hostages\" to refer to Capitol rioters.\n\nMr Pence oversaw proceedings in Congress to certify Joe Biden's 2020 election win as crowds stormed the building. Some chanted \"Hang Mike Pence\" and he was rushed to safety as protesters broke windows before rampaging through the Senate.",

        "text": "Four Filipino Americans Win 2024 Primary Elections in California \u2013 Asia Matters for America\nOn March 6, 2024, four Filipino Americans emerged as leading candidates in the primary elections for California Senate, California\u2019s 52nd District State Assembly, Los Angeles\u2019 14th District City Council, and San Diego\u2019s mayoral race. Their feats demonstrate the growing presence of Filipino American voices in the United States and the need for more diverse representation at local and state levels.\n\nIntroduction\n\nFilipino Americans have been an integral part of California\u2019s social and economic history for generations. In the 1920s, thousands of Filipino agricultural workers and service laborers immigrated to the \"Golden State,\u201d contributing to the development of the West Coast and bringing along their rich traditions and cultural pride. Today, over four million live across California, making Filipino Americans the third largest ethnic population in the state.\n\nDespite their monumental impacts and growing presence, these populations have historically been underrepresented in American politics. Though over two million Filipino Americans are eligible voters in California alone, few Filipino Americans occupy public offices in the state. For instance, there has never been a person of Filipino descent in the California Senate. However, some politicians this year are taking strides to change this reality and uplift the voices of Filipino voters.\n\nOn March 5, 2024, California held its primary election to determine which candidates will advance to the November general election for local, state, and federal offices. Notably, California implements a Top-Two Primary system, where all contenders for \u201cvoter-nominated\u201d office positions are listed on one ballot, regardless of party affiliation. The results of the primary only allow the leading two candidates to run in November, but these rules do not apply to the presidential election or local offices.\n\nSignificantly, four Filipino American politicians\u2014Jessica Caloza, Christopher Cabaldon, Ysabel Jurado, and Todd Gloria\u2014raced to the forefront of their respective primary elections in March, increasing representation at the local and state levels.\n\nThe Four Candidates\n\nJessica Caloza\n\nElection details: As the only Asian American and first Filipina running, Jessica Caloza won the California 52nd District State Assembly primary election, securing 30.1% of the votes. District 52 includes a large portion of Los Angeles and the southern region of Glendale.\n\nBackground: Originally born in Quezon City, Philippines, Caloza has a long history in the public sector. She worked as an education policy advisor during Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, and she served as the first Filipino American commissioner on the Los Angeles Board of Public Works. She also assisted California Attorney General Rob Bonta as his Chief of Staff.\n\nCampaign platform for Filipino American communities: She has focused a portion of her campaign on bolstering the voices of Filipino Americans in local government. In a TikTok video, she said, \u201c... in LA County, we have the largest number of Filipinos outside of the Philippines . . . and Filipino Americans in LA, in California, and in the United States are so powerful.\u201d\n\nChristopher Cabaldon\n\nElection details: Although Christopher Cabaldon was the second runner-up in the California Senate District 3 primary election with 26.6% of the votes, he will advance to the general election in November. District 3 includes Napa, Solano, Yolo, Sonoma, Sacramento, and Contra Costa counties.\n\nBackground: Cabaldon started his public service career in the Yolo County health commission and city council. Before his current campaign, he was the West Sacramento Mayor from 1998 to 2020. During his term, he was appointed to the National Advisory Board of College Promise to assist with educational initiatives.\n\nCampaign platform for Filipino American communities: Cabaldon promised during the primary election to address anti-Asian hate and support Filipino-owned businesses.\n\nYsabel Jurado\n\nElection details: Running for the Los Angeles City Council\u2019s 14th District seat, Ysabel Jurado secured the most votes in the primary election. Though a close-call election, polls indicated she received 24.52% of the votes. The 14th District encompasses Northeast Los Angeles, Downtown Los Angeles, El Sereno, Lincoln Heights, and Boyle Heights.\n\nBackground: A child of undocumented Filipino immigrants, Jurado is a tenants rights attorney. She has never held a public office position, but she is the first Filipino American woman to run for city council in the 14th District.\n\nCampaign platform for Filipino American communities: Jurado is focused on housing security and public safety for minority populations, including Filipino locals.\n\nTodd Gloria\n\nElection details: As the incumbent, Todd Gloria gained 50.9% of the votes in San Diego\u2019s mayoral primary election.\n\nBackground: Gloria previously served in the San Diego City Council and in California\u2019s 78th State Assembly. When elected as mayor of San Diego in 2020, he became the first Filipino American mayor to govern a US city with a population of over a million.\n\nCampaign platform for Filipino American communities: Gloria used his previous term as mayor to create Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) initiatives, such as the Asian-Pacific Islander Advisory Group. His campaign is focused on continuing and expanding these efforts.\n\nThe Future of Politics and Filipino Americans\n\nThe 2024 California General Election is set for November 5, 2024, and county elections offices will send vote-by-mail ballots to all registered California voters on October 7, 2024.\n\nThough the primary election results do not guarantee the success of the four individual campaigns, they do signify a growing trend of AAPI influence in various levels of government. In 1980, around 160 officials of Asian descent were in public offices across the United States, and by 2016, that number rose to 463. The emergence of Jessica Caloza, Christopher Cabaldon, Ysabel Jurado, and Todd Gloria is a testament to the AAPI community\u2019s burgeoning impact on the public sector and the significance of Filipino American representation in local and state offices.\n\n-------------------------\n\nDenise Sievert Geronimo is a participant in the Young Professionals Program at the East-West Center in Washington.

        "text": "Brazil Overview: Development news, research, data\nBrazil is home to 203 million people with a real GDP per capita of US$9,032 in 2023. It is a large federal country comprised of the union (federal government), 26 states (plus the Federal District), and over 5,500 municipalities. While it is highly diverse, racial and gender discrimination persist as systemic barriers that limit the opportunities of many individuals and families to break the inter-generational cycle of poverty.\n\nIts people live in multiple ecosystems across a landmass of 8.5 million km2 (about the size of the continental United States), with sharp differences in race, history, culture, and industry manifesting many \u201cBrazils.\u201d The country\u2019s overall Human Capital Index (HCI) shows that Brazilian children born today will have, as adults, only 55 percent of the productivity they would have had with full access to quality health and education opportunities. Factoring in adult unemployment, their productivity falls to 33 percent, implying that 67 percent of Brazil\u2019s talent is lost to society.\n\nAfro-Brazilians and Indigenous Peoples have less access to good-quality schools and health services than whites, and women face job discrimination that limits their earning potential far more than men. Even before COVID, some areas of Brazil had an HCI at around 40 percent (e.g., in the North and Northeast regions), akin to what can be found in Sub-Saharan Africa, while others (e.g., in the richer Southeast of Brazil) had HCI levels around 70 percent, on par with countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).\n\nBrazil\u2019s real GDP expanded by 2.9 percent in 2023 and is expected to grow by 2.8 percent in 2024, driven by solid consumption, sustained by a robust labor market, and fiscal transfers. Real GDP growth is expected to moderate to 2.2 percent in 2025 and to converge to 2.3 percent in the medium term, reflecting the effect of past and ongoing structural reforms.\n\nInflation is projected to gradually converge towards 3.8 percent by 2025, within the Central Bank\u2019s target range, though a recent deterioration of inflation expectations is likely to slow the pace of the monetary easing which in turn will contribute to moderate growth.\n\nLooking ahead, real GDP is projected to grow at approximately 2.3 percent over the medium term. Poverty, measured at the US$6.85 per capita per day poverty line, decreased from 23.5 percent in 2022 to 21.8 percent in 2023, explained by improvements in economic conditions and social protection policies such as the Bolsa Familia program.\n\nBrazil\u2019s macroeconomic buffers remain solid, with ample international reserves, low external debt, a credible and independent central bank, a resilient financial system; and exchange rate flexibility. In addition, Brazil initiated the first phase of a long-awaited reform of indirect taxes, whose further legislation will be elaborated in 2024. The indirect tax reform is expected to improve the business environment through tax simplification and to boost productivity.\n\nHowever, the general government primary deficit reached 2.4 percent of GDP in 2023, from a surplus of 1.2 percent in 2022, while public debt stood at 74.4 percent of GDP, up from 71.7 percent in 2022. Structural challenges for the Brazilian economy include a still complex tax system, a cumbersome business environment that discourages entrepreneurship, low savings and infrastructure investments, and limited integration in global markets that curb innovation and hinder competitiveness. Aging related challenges, particularly in health and pensions, are projected to put pressure on public finances.\n\nAchieving higher levels of productivity and sustainable growth remain a key challenge that has become more urgent and will require bolder action. Productivity growth in manufacturing and services has been stagnant for 20 years and growth projections remain below upper middle-income country peers. While the agriculture sector registered productivity gains (through investments in innovation, technology, and trade logistic, as well as sector-specific government incentives) and sustained Brazil\u2019s position as the world\u2019s third-largest agricultural and food exporter, part of this success relied on extensive farming methods that threaten important biomes and biodiversity.\n\nOverall, it is now clear that Brazil cannot rely on commodity booms and greater inputs of land and labor to reach high-income status. Instead, it needs to shift away from factor accumulation towards a low-carbon productivity-led growth model that is driven by high-quality education and modern infrastructure, including digital, to create more and better jobs. Brazil could also act as a global innovation hub through more competition, higher openness to trade, and integration with regional and global value chains.\n\nA more conducive business environment would attract greater private investment in industries and in the climate transition. Despite the financial system\u2019s development, further progress is needed to increase its efficiency. Finally, Brazil could empower its entire workforce to contribute and benefit further, especially by easing the systemic barriers that limit capital accumulation and job opportunities among Afro-Brazilians, Indigenous Peoples, women, and youth.\n\nAdditionally, Brazil\u2019s natural endowments position it well to exploit new growth opportunities as the world shifts to low-carbon economic sectors and markets. Since three-quarters of Brazil\u2019s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions result from land-use change and agriculture, stopping deforestation and transitioning towards low-carbon agriculture is a priority.\n\nThe Amazon rainforest is now near a tipping point beyond which it might not generate enough rainfall to sustain its own ecosystem or the agriculture, hydropower, water supply, and industries that have fueled Brazil\u2019s growth, or the environmental services that it provides to the rest of Latin America and the Caribbean as well as the rest of the world. Efforts to stop deforestation in the Amazon cannot result in more deforestation in other biomes like the Cerrado, as they are also important for similar reasons.\n\nThe agriculture sector has scope to curb deforestation and scale-up climate-smart land use while raising its productivity further. In addition, given its low-carbon energy matrix, Brazil can decarbonize transport, industry, and cities (\u201cdeep decarbonization\u201d) at a very low net cost of about 0.5 percent of GDP per annum above \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d costs, on average, between now and 2050. Doing so would position Brazil extremely well to integrate its businesses into the green economy of the future.\n\nSignificant progress is within reach, but time is of the essence. The current government brought renewed political will, a strong reform agenda, and ambitious development programs to fight hunger and inequality, promote social justice, re-industrialize Brazil, and embrace a greener economy. It is committed to reaching zero illegal deforestation by 2030 and has launched an ambitious Ecological Transformation Plan (ETP) to promote inclusive and sustainable development while tackling climate change. The ETP\u2019s goals are to boost productivity and generate well-paid green jobs, to reduce the economy\u2019s environmental footprint, and to promote equitable development through better income distribution and benefits.\n\nAdditionally, significant progress will require sustained efforts and strong buy-in among key actors, including in the private sector, in a way that transcends political divisions and election cycles. If successful, the programs, policies and reforms adopted now would help strengthen Brazil\u2019s productive structure and technological innovations in the short-term while also generating stronger foundations for the longer-term.\n\nLast Updated: Oct 21, 2024",

        "text": "Peter Pellegrini: Russia-friendly populist elected Slovak president\nPeter Pellegrini: Russia-friendly populist elected Slovak president\n\nReuters Peter Pellegrini is an ally of Prime Minister Robert Fico\n\nPopulist Peter Pellegrini has been elected president of Slovakia, succeeding the liberal Zuzana Caputova.\n\nMr Pellegrini, 48, defeated the pro-Western Ivan Kor\u010dok, a former diplomat, with 53% of the vote.\n\nA former prime minister, he is an ally of Prime Minister Robert Fico, and shares the PM's dovish attitude towards Russia.\n\nMr Fico and his allies now control Slovakia's parliament, government, and soon the president's office.\n\nSlovakia had been one of Ukraine's staunchest allies before Mr Fico came to power in October on a pledge to halt supplies of Slovak Army military stocks to Kyiv. With Mr Pellegrini replacing Mrs Caputova, Ukraine has now definitively lost a voice of support in an EU and Nato capital.\n\nMr Fico has called for an end to Western military support for Ukraine, an immediate ceasefire, and peace talks with Moscow. He said recently President Vladimir Putin had been \"unfairly demonised\" and argued admitting Ukraine to Nato would mark the beginning of a third world war.\n\nMr Pellegrini's campaign echoed some of that Moscow-friendly rhetoric, accusing Mr Kor\u010dok of being a warmonger who would send Slovak soldiers to fight in Ukraine - a constitutional power the president does not have.\n\nOn Sunday Mr Pellegrini vowed \"to ensure that Slovakia remains on the side of peace and not on the side of war\".\n\n\"You don't have to worry that the Presidential Palace, as it has been for the last 10 years, will become a centre of oppositional, opportunistic power that will harm the government, that will harm the state abroad and will rejoice in the failures of the Slovak government,\" he said.\n\nOnce Mrs Caputova steps down in June, there will no longer be any high-level official in Slovakia - a country which barely a year ago donated its entire fleet of MiG-29 aircraft to Ukraine - who unequivocally backs Kyiv's effort to defend its territory with force.\n\nMr Kor\u010dok expressed his anger at Mr Pellegrini's campaign tactics, saying it was fear that decided the outcome of the election, and \"that fear was spread by those who are hidden in state positions\".\n\nHe said of the result: \"It turns out that it is possible to become President of the Slovak Republic not only by spreading hatred, whipping up passions and pushing people to the barricades, but also by painting the opposite number, that is to say, me, as a candidate of war. I will not forget this.\"\n\nThe liberal pro-Western opposition also accuses Mr Pellegrini - as head of the coalition Hlas party and chairman of parliament - of remaining silent as Mr Fico took a wrecking ball to Slovakia's criminal justice system, notably abolishing the Special Prosecutor's Office, which was set up 20 years ago to probe serious corruption and economic crime.\n\nIt had investigated a number of senior officials in Mr Fico's Smer party, and had been overseeing the prosecution of those believed to be responsible for the murder of investigative journalist Jan Kuciak and his fianc\u00e9e Martina Kusnirova in 2018.\n\nThe killings were a seismic event in Slovak politics. The fallout ended Mr Fico's second premiership in 2018 and led to the liberal, pro-Western Zuzana Caputova being elected president on a wave of popular anger at official corruption and organised crime.\n\nRobert Fico's government recently set its sights on Slovakia's public broadcaster, submitting plans to abolish the institution and replace it with one under virtual state control. Those plans were put on the back burner after a surprisingly poor showing from Peter Pellegrini in the first round of the presidential election two weeks ago.",

She is an expert on campaigns, elections and public opinion, with an emphasis on how candidate behavior affects voters. She has researched campaign advertising, survey methods, politics and the media, and how the state of the economy affects elections.\n\nHer most recent book, \u201cThe Bitter End: The 2020 Presidential Campaign and the Challenge to American Democracy, co-authored with UCLA political scientist Chris Tausanovitch, has drawn observations and insights from the Democracy Fund + UCLA Nationscape Project, a wide-ranging weekly public opinion survey of the American electorate conducted in the years leading up to and after the 2020 presidential election.\n\nShe is the author or co-author of several other books, including \u201cIdentity Crisis: The 2016 Presidential Campaign and the Battle for the Meaning of America\u201d and \u201cThe Gamble: Choice and Chance in the 2012 Presidential Election.\u201d Political consultants on both sides of the aisle refer to her work on political messaging in \u201cThe Message Matters\u201d as required reading for presidential candidates.\n\nShe is a recipient of the Andrew F. Carnegie Prize in the Humanities and Social Sciences, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a contributor to the New York Times.\n\nVavreck discusses the top issues influencing voters in 2024, including Trump\u2019s legal cases and her advice for undecided voters.\n\nUCLA Lynn Vavreck, Marvin Hoffenberg Professor of American Politics and Public Policy at UCLA\n\nWhat is calcification, and how is this a helpful lens for understanding what is to come in the 2024 presidential election?\n\nPolitics feel stuck, something my colleagues and I call calcification. Calcification is like \u201cpolarization plus.\u201d It\u2019s not just that the parties are further apart, or just more polarized than ever before; each party is also more homogenous. On top of that, more personal, emotional, identity-inflected issues \u2014 like religious tests to enter the country, reproductive rights and immigration, as opposed to issues centered on the role and size of government \u2014 are the dimension on which politics is being contested, and this new dimension is made up of issues on which most people will not entertain a vote for the other side. Add that to the relatively equal power of the two major political parties over the last eight or so years, and we get to where we are today, with politics feeling stuck.\n\nCalcification doesn\u2019t mean the same side wins every time. It means elections are going to be very close, and small things can determine the outcome. It also means that parties are not likely to alter their stances on these identity-inflected issues. Why should they? Their party wins \u2014 or almost wins \u2014 every time.\n\nThe stock market is up, inflation is apparently down, unemployment is down. But economic inequality is growing and most working people are feeling the sting of cost-of-living increases. How will the economy, or talk of the economy, shape this election cycle? How will this differ from the 2020 election?\n\nThe actual state of the nation\u2019s economy is always important to election outcomes. Even though identity-inflected issues have surpassed issues like taxes and social security as the most important to our politics post-2016, the marginal voter is likely to be swayed by the nation\u2019s economy. This is not so much the voter\u2019s assessment of the economy, but the actual growth rate or income change rate. Trump is likely to remind voters they were better off when he was president \u2014 this is not untrue for most people. Still, growth is up, so I suspect Biden will get a small boost \u2014 but a small boost might be pivotal in a close election.\n\nHow will Trump\u2019s and Biden\u2019s rhetoric over the next eight months address the topic of border enforcement and immigration to appeal to voters? How will political ads play a factor?\n\nImmigration is one of the major issues leading to the calcification of politics. Biden managed to put a strong bipartisan immigration plan to Congress, which might have neutralized Trump\u2019s appeal on the issue, but Trump pressured Republicans in Congress to stop Biden\u2019s reform plan.\n\nWhat Trump missed in this calculation was that having Biden out on the campaign trail offering the same solutions as Trump essentially neutralizes the issue. Of course, Trump will try to blame Biden for not solving the problem, but Biden will try to explain that Trump stopped the solution to get a political win. This will be a complicated argument for Biden to make. I suspect a lot of Trump\u2019s ads will be about this. This topic is only made more salient to people when states clash with the federal government over enforcement, as is happening right now in Texas.\n\nA growing number of Latino voters are voting Republican, especially in key states like Texas and Florida. Why is this the case? Does this have to do with immigration or other issues? Is immigration an identity-inflected issue? How does the issue play out for Latino voters?\n\nAs with most voters, those who have moved toward Trump in the last eight years are conservative. This is true across many groups. Immigration, as an identity-inflected issue, is certainly a part of people figuring out that being conservative on this issue and voting for Democrats was a mismatch in 2016 and after.\n\nHow will the issue of reproductive rights and the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade play a role in this election? How will this differ from the 2020 presidential election?\n\nThe reversal of Roe may mobilize more people who didn\u2019t vote in 2020, but it is unlikely to make voters switch to the other side. A Republican who is pro-choice and is motivated to think more about that because of Dobbs (and entertain a vote for Biden) is a Republican who historically may not have cared very much about abortion policy, because if they did, given their position they wouldn\u2019t be voting for Republicans. Still, small changes in votes could be pivotal in a close election, so this could be important.\n\nHow do you see the legal cases against Trump, many of which are expected to be delayed until after the election, impacting the presidential race? Will claims that Trump evaded the rule of law help tip the scale in either direction \u2014 Biden or Trump?\n\nIn close elections, anything can be pivotal, but it is seeming less likely by the week that any of these trials will be over before people start voting early in October. Each of these trials is an opportunity for Trump to stage campaign events. His supporters likely will stick with him throughout the summer and into fall. Nearly everyone who votes already has an opinion about Trump\u2019s character, so even for marginal voters the effects may not be significant.\n\nWhat other top issues will help decide the 2024 election?\n\nThe only issues that are likely to shape 2024 are identity-inflected issues and the economy. But anything that can move a few thousand voters at the margins is potentially pivotal. I doubt there are surprises lurking \u2014 big issues or strategies that will reshape things. The race is in place. Calcification means most people can\u2019t entertain a vote for the other side, so 2024 should look a lot like 2016 and 2020.\n\nWhat will it take for Biden or Trump to win that increasingly smaller pool of swing voters?\n\nTrump probably has to continue to rally his base by appealing to identity-inflected topics and also blame Biden for what feels like a sluggish economy. Biden\u2019s job is to sell his economic recovery from the pandemic and remind people how awful 2020 and its aftermath was \u2014 and how all of that feels like ancient history now (for most people). This will be hard because explaining why most people felt more flush under Trump relative to under Biden is complicated and requires explanation. And one of my favorite rules of politics is, \u201cif you\u2019re explaining, you\u2019re losing.\u201d\n\nWhat issues do Americans for the most part agree on, if any?\n\nThere are some policy positions that most people would like to see enacted into legislation. Universal gun background checks is the one I think of first. A majority of people in both parties want it. Paid maternity leave and a $15 minimum wage are others. None of them, however, are among the most important things voters care about right now.\n\nGiven your research, what advice do you have for the undecided voter?\n\nBe sure you know what policies each party wants to enact into legislation on the issues you care about and vote accordingly. The parties want to build very different worlds; you don\u2019t want to get this wrong.\n\nIs there any other question regarding your research that you would want to be asked at this time by a reporter, given where we are in April of a presidential election year? If so, please pose the question and answer it.\n\nI would only add that Trump has been in the news so frequently for the last several months because of his court cases that this has likely activated his supporters in a way that mimics the heart of a campaign period. Biden has not been in the same position, so one of the things that is possible is that Biden\u2019s voters have not yet been activated to show up and support their candidate, because they haven\u2019t had to yet. This may be why the gap in the polls is bigger than people expect it to be. The election is a long way off and the campaigns haven\u2019t started yet. When they do, both sets of voters will engage, and then we will get a proper read on the state of the contest.",

        "text": "Office of Elections\nHawaii Elections\n\nHawaii conducts statewide elections in even-numbered years. The primary election is held on the second Saturday in August and the general election is held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November.\n\nView the election calendar for dates and deadlines.\n\nPursuant to Act 136, SLH 2019, elections are conducted by mail. All registered voters automatically receive their ballot in the mail approximately eighteen (18) days prior to the election. Ballots are sent to the mailing address provided with the voter's voter registration. To register or update your voter registration, visit Voter Registration.\n\nPrimary Election\n\nThe primary election nominates candidates to represent political parties in the general election. Similarly, candidates who do not belong to a political party will be nominated to the general election by meeting the qualifications as a nonpartisan candidate running in a partisan contest.\n\nHawaii voters do not declare a political affiliation with the voter registration pursuant to the Hawaii State Constitution, ensuring every voter's right to secrecy. On the primary election ballot, voters must first select a political affiliation and then vote for candidates of the political affiliation of their choice only.\n\nVoters may also vote for candidates for the Office of Hawaiian Affairs and county contests regardless of party affiliation.\n\nGeneral Election\n\nThe general election is a candidate contest, meaning that voters may vote for the candidate of their choice regardless of political affiliation. Voters will select federal, state, county, and Office of Hawaiian Affairs candidates, as well as State Constitutional Amendments and/or Charter Amendments.\n\nPresidential Elections\n\nHawaii does not conduct a presidential preference primary.

HRS \u00a7 11-100.\n\nWhat is ranked-choice voting?\n\nRanked-choice voting\" is the method of casting and tabulating votes in which voters rank candidates in order of preference, tabulation proceeds in sequential rounds in which last-place candidates are defeated, and the candidate with the most votes in the final round is elected.\" HRS \u00a7\u00a7 11-110(e).\n\nSpecific statutory procedures are followed in each round. HRS \u00a7\u00a7 11-110(b)-(d).\n\nHow does ranked-choice voting work?\n\nIf a candidate receives a majority of votes, 50 percent plus one, in the first round, that candidate wins. However, if no candidate receives a majority of votes, the votes of the defeated candidate(s) are redistributed.\n\nIn each round, the candidate with the lowest number of votes is defeated. Those votes are then redistributed as votes for the continuing candidates, counting for the voter\u2019s next ranked candidate in the following round.\n\nThis process of redistributing votes continues until a candidate reaches a majority of the votes.\n\nRegistering to Vote\n\nTo register to vote in the State of Hawaii, you must be:\n\nA U.S. Citizen\n\nA resident of Hawaii\n\nAt least sixteen (16) years old.

        "text": "The U.S. Presidential Election: What\u2019s at Stake for Democracy Globally\nThe U.S. presidential election this year will have the greatest potential impact on democratic movements and institutions around the world. American voters have now chosen two candidates for the office with two different attitudes toward the traditional global order, democratic governance, and the rule of law. To underline the implications on democratic norms globally, the Center for the Study of Democracy organized the online discussion \u201cThe U.S. Presidential Election: What\u2019s at Stake for Democracy Globally\u201d, held on April 8.\n\nThe event brought together star line-up from the Wall Street Journal:\n\nJohn Bussey, Associate Editor \u2013 New York, The Wall Street Journal;\n\nAaron Zitner, Reporter and Editor, Washington Bureau \u2013 Washington, D.C., The Wall Street Journal;\n\nGerald F. Seib, Former Washington Bureau Chief \u2013 Washington D.C., The Wall Street Journal; and\n\nDeborah Ball, Deputy Editor of World News \u2013 London, The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe discussion highlighted the political shift from Ronald Reagan's conservatism to Donald Trump's populism in the U.S., underscoring a dramatic change where the Republican Party now appeals more to a working-class demographic, marking a departure from its traditional base. This shift is intertwined with broader global phenomena such as economic globalization, the 2008 financial crisis, unresolved immigration issues, and a surge in populism, all of which pose significant challenges to the fabric of democracy.",

        "text": "Biden could be left off Ohio ballot in November, state election office says\nPresident Joe Biden could be left off the ballot in Ohio in November, unless the GOP-led state legislature makes an exception to Ohio's ballot deadline or the Democratic Party moves up its nominating convention, according to the Ohio secretary of state's office.\n\nOhio set a deadline of Aug. 7 to certify presidential candidates for the general election, almost two weeks before the Democratic National Convention, where Mr. Biden is expected to be formally nominated by his party to run against presumptive GOP nominee former President Donald Trump. It is unlikely that the party would shift the date of the convention.\n\nIn a letter to state Democratic Party Chair Liz Walters last week, Paul DiSantis, the chief legal counsel for GOP Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, said Ohio law requires that presidential candidates be certified 90 days before this year's general election, which takes place on Nov. 5.\n\n\"The Democratic National Convention is scheduled to convene on August 19, 2024, which occurs more than a week after the August 7 deadline to certify a presidential candidate to this office,\" DiSantis wrote. \"Therefore, pending further clarification, I am left to conclude that the Democratic National Committee must either move up its nominating convention or the Ohio General Assembly must act by May 9, 2024 (90 days prior to a new law's effective date) to create an exception to this statutory requirement.\"\n\n\"Please contact me as soon as possible with any information that can assure this office of timely compliance with Ohio law,\" DiSantis wrote.\n\nThe Biden campaign said over the weekend that it does not expect the statute to keep the president off the ballot.\n\n\"We're monitoring the situation in Ohio, and we're confident that Joe Biden will be on the ballot in all 50 states,\" the campaign said in a statement.\n\nA similar situation occurred before the 2020 presidential election, too. Both the Republican and Democratic conventions were scheduled outside the deadline window, so Ohio lawmakers approved changing the cutoff to 60 days \u2014 but only for that election.\n\nThe Ohio Democratic Party confirmed it has received the letter and is reviewing it.\n\nTrump won Ohio in 2016 and also in 2020, when he lost to Mr. Biden, becoming the first losing presidential candidate Ohio had supported since it sided with Richard Nixon over John F. Kennedy in 1960.\n\nAaron Navarro contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Beyond Biden vs Trump: The other US elections that matter\nMany Australians are following the rematch in the 2024 US presidential election between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Trump's reality TV approach to politics makes it hard to avert one's eyes, with onlookers concerned about the consequences for Australia. But regardless of whether Trump or Biden wins the presidency, the party that controls the US Congress will influence foreign policy. The president may lead, but Congress can impede.\n\nUnder the US Constitution, Congress has considerable authority to push back against a president, which typically happens when a rival party controls a chamber.\n\nParties in the US Congress have razor-thin margins separating them, and the elections could give either of them power with just a small shift of seats. The Democrats control the Senate 51\u201349. In the House, Republicans control the 435-seat chamber by just two seats. With the country so polarised, it is doubtful there will be a sizable swing in seats that would give either party a mandate. But all it takes for power to shift is a few thousand votes in some states and districts.\n\nHere is why those votes will matter. Under the US Constitution, Congress has considerable authority to push back against a president, which typically happens when a rival party controls a chamber. For Australia, the US Senate will be especially important given its role in foreign policy debates, including presidential appointments like the Secretary of State and approval of treaties (last year, Congress passed legislation that prohibits any president from withdrawing from NATO without the approval of two-thirds of the US Senate). The US House weighs in heavily on defence spending, foreign aid and trade agreements. Many decisions by these chambers have implications for US allies. If Republicans run the table and win control of the White House and both chambers of Congress, radical policy change affecting Australia is still unlikely, but it is bound to introduce uncertainty in US foreign affairs, which has its own implications.\n\nUS President Joe Biden (C) delivers remarks on the AUKUS partnership with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese (L) and UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak (R), 13 March 2023 (Adam Schultz/White House/Flickr)\n\nWhat about AUKUS? Australians have committed themselves to a big financial and geopolitical investment with the trilateral partnership. Will the US Congress hold up its end of the bargain under new leadership? While any international deal holds risks, I think so. There appears to be more bipartisan consensus about security perils in the Pacific compared to Europe\u2019s threat from Russia. Trump has no special animus towards Australia (like he does Europe), and while he\u2019s not very strategic, he is transactional. This deal appears to benefit US domestic workers and the defence industry. Trump will get pushback from Congress if he tries to renege, especially if the Democrats have control. Republicans will push back too, if the replacement for the retiring Republican leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, is from the same hawkish wing of the party. Keep in mind that the National Defense Authorization Act, which approved AUKUS, passed with significant bipartisan support except for the ideological fringes of both parties. The centre still holds on foreign policy in Congress.\n\nThe Democrats have a decent shot at re-taking the US House, even if Trump wins. But bets are off if Trump expands his lead over Biden as the election nears.\n\nSo, who is likely to win control of these chambers? They are as hard to predict as the presidency. The Republicans probably have an advantage in the Senate because the Democrats are trying to protect more incumbents in highly competitive states. And three states are complete toss-ups: rust-belt Ohio, mountain-rural Montana, and western-sunbelt Arizona. All three Republican candidates have earned the MAGA label from Trump \u2014 meaning they support his brand of America First, election-denying populism. In two of those states, Ohio and Montana, the Democratic incumbents have defied gravity in previous elections by winning in states dominated by Republican voters. It is far from clear they can pull that off again.\n\nOver in the House, it is a somewhat different story with Democrats feeling like they have a decent shot of taking control. The seat margin favouring House Republicans gets smaller with each retirement of a disillusioned moderate Republican. Democrats and Republicans are defending roughly an equal number of toss-up seats, about ten each. Keep your eyes on California and New York. The good news for Democrats is that many toss-ups occupied by Republicans are in these two blue states with \"crossover\" districts (which vote for president of one party and House for the other). In an era of party polarisation, crossover districts are a vanishing breed. And Democrats certainly hope so in these districts, which will be lavished with millions in campaign funds to sway a few thousand, or maybe a few hundred, voters.\n\nHouse Democrats are typically at a disadvantage because of how local districts get drawn, and this election will be no different. But the House Republicans appear to be knee-capping themselves, looking like the chaos party with a radical faction, called the Freedom Caucus, pushing to depose its leaders, block funding for Ukraine, and shut down the government by refusing to approve budgets. The current Speaker, an evangelical Republican from Louisiana, is inexperienced and holding on by his fingernails. While gerrymandered districts give a slight edge to Republicans, if the party allows its most conservative factions to push hard on issues like abortion they will suffer in the suburban districts with moderate women voters.\n\nSo, the Democrats have a decent shot at re-taking the House, even if Trump wins. But bets are off if Trump expands his lead over Biden as the election nears, which would indicate a surge in Republican voters. I don't expect that to happen. The election is likely to be a nail-biter with an evenly divided electorate staying loyal to their party, even if they don't like the candidates. And in a close election for control of each office \u2014 president, Senate, and House \u2014 there are good odds of a divided government, which means the United States may drift but won't fundamentally change its relationships with allies like Australia. That may be the best news to offer during a time of rancorous disunity in the United States.",

        "text": "What did Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson say about Joe Biden and the US election in Fox News interview?\nDwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson is facing criticism over comments about his previous endorsement of Joe Biden.\n\nThe 51-year-old actor, who backed Mr Biden when he ran for US president in 2020, was asked in an interview with Fox News whether he would do so again during this campaign.\n\nBut what did Johnson say and why is he being criticised?\n\nBiden endorsement 'caused division'\n\nAsked by Fox News whether he was happy with his 2020 endorsement and the current state of America, the former wrestler said: \"Am I happy with the state of America right now? Well, that answer's no. Do I believe we're going to get better? I believe in that.

        "text": "Q&A: Lynn Vavreck discusses Biden, Trump and America\u2019s great political divide\nAs voters prepare for a likely second presidential election between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, the nation\u2019s political and social divisions have expanded beyond government-centric election issues like the economy to more personal matters of identity.\n\nLynn Vavreck, UCLA\u2019s Marvin Hoffenberg Professor of American Politics and Public Policy, helps us unpack this. She is an expert on campaigns, elections and public opinion, with an emphasis on how candidate behavior affects voters. She has researched campaign advertising, survey methods, politics and the media, and how the state of the economy affects elections.\n\nHer most recent book, \u201cThe Bitter End: The 2020 Presidential Campaign and the Challenge to American Democracy, co-authored with UCLA political scientist Chris Tausanovitch, has drawn observations and insights from the Democracy Fund + UCLA Nationscape Project, a wide-ranging weekly public opinion survey of the American electorate conducted in the years leading up to and after the 2020 presidential election.\n\nShe is the author or co-author of several other books, including \u201cIdentity Crisis: The 2016 Presidential Campaign and the Battle for the Meaning of America\u201d and \u201cThe Gamble: Choice and Chance in the 2012 Presidential Election.\u201d Political consultants on both sides of the aisle refer to her work on political messaging in \u201cThe Message Matters\u201d as required reading for presidential candidates.\n\nShe is a recipient of the Andrew F. Carnegie Prize in the Humanities and Social Sciences, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a contributor to the New York Times.\n\nVavreck discusses the top issues influencing voters in 2024, including Trump\u2019s legal cases and her advice for undecided voters.\n\nUCLA Lynn Vavreck, Marvin Hoffenberg Professor of American Politics and Public Policy at UCLA\n\nWhat is calcification, and how is this a helpful lens for understanding what is to come in the 2024 presidential election?\n\nPolitics feel stuck, something my colleagues and I call calcification. Calcification is like \u201cpolarization plus.\u201d It\u2019s not just that the parties are further apart, or just more polarized than ever before; each party is also more homogenous. On top of that, more personal, emotional, identity-inflected issues \u2014 like religious tests to enter the country, reproductive rights and immigration, as opposed to issues centered on the role and size of government \u2014 are the dimension on which politics is being contested, and this new dimension is made up of issues on which most people will not entertain a vote for the other side. Add that to the relatively equal power of the two major political parties over the last eight or so years, and we get to where we are today, with politics feeling stuck.\n\nCalcification doesn\u2019t mean the same side wins every time. It means elections are going to be very close, and small things can determine the outcome. It also means that parties are not likely to alter their stances on these identity-inflected issues. Why should they? Their party wins \u2014 or almost wins \u2014 every time.\n\nThe stock market is up, inflation is apparently down, unemployment is down. But economic inequality is growing and most working people are feeling the sting of cost-of-living increases. How will the economy, or talk of the economy, shape this election cycle? How will this differ from the 2020 election?\n\nThe actual state of the nation\u2019s economy is always important to election outcomes. Even though identity-inflected issues have surpassed issues like taxes and social security as the most important to our politics post-2016, the marginal voter is likely to be swayed by the nation\u2019s economy. This is not so much the voter\u2019s assessment of the economy, but the actual growth rate or income change rate. Trump is likely to remind voters they were better off when he was president \u2014 this is not untrue for most people. Still, growth is up, so I suspect Biden will get a small boost \u2014 but a small boost might be pivotal in a close election.\n\nHow will Trump\u2019s and Biden\u2019s rhetoric over the next eight months address the topic of border enforcement and immigration to appeal to voters? How will political ads play a factor?\n\nImmigration is one of the major issues leading to the calcification of politics. Biden managed to put a strong bipartisan immigration plan to Congress, which might have neutralized Trump\u2019s appeal on the issue, but Trump pressured Republicans in Congress to stop Biden\u2019s reform plan.\n\nWhat Trump missed in this calculation was that having Biden out on the campaign trail offering the same solutions as Trump essentially neutralizes the issue. Of course, Trump will try to blame Biden for not solving the problem, but Biden will try to explain that Trump stopped the solution to get a political win. This will be a complicated argument for Biden to make. I suspect a lot of Trump\u2019s ads will be about this. This topic is only made more salient to people when states clash with the federal government over enforcement, as is happening right now in Texas.\n\nA growing number of Latino voters are voting Republican, especially in key states like Texas and Florida. Why is this the case? Does this have to do with immigration or other issues? Is immigration an identity-inflected issue? How does the issue play out for Latino voters?\n\nAs with most voters, those who have moved toward Trump in the last eight years are conservative. This is true across many groups. Immigration, as an identity-inflected issue, is certainly a part of people figuring out that being conservative on this issue and voting for Democrats was a mismatch in 2016 and after.\n\nHow will the issue of reproductive rights and the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade play a role in this election? How will this differ from the 2020 presidential election?\n\nThe reversal of Roe may mobilize more people who didn\u2019t vote in 2020, but it is unlikely to make voters switch to the other side. A Republican who is pro-choice and is motivated to think more about that because of Dobbs (and entertain a vote for Biden) is a Republican who historically may not have cared very much about abortion policy, because if they did, given their position they wouldn\u2019t be voting for Republicans. Still, small changes in votes could be pivotal in a close election, so this could be important.\n\nHow do you see the legal cases against Trump, many of which are expected to be delayed until after the election, impacting the presidential race? Will claims that Trump evaded the rule of law help tip the scale in either direction \u2014 Biden or Trump?\n\nIn close elections, anything can be pivotal, but it is seeming less likely by the week that any of these trials will be over before people start voting early in October. Each of these trials is an opportunity for Trump to stage campaign events. His supporters likely will stick with him throughout the summer and into fall. Nearly everyone who votes already has an opinion about Trump\u2019s character, so even for marginal voters the effects may not be significant.\n\nWhat other top issues will help decide the 2024 election?\n\nThe only issues that are likely to shape 2024 are identity-inflected issues and the economy. But anything that can move a few thousand voters at the margins is potentially pivotal. I doubt there are surprises lurking \u2014 big issues or strategies that will reshape things. The race is in place. Calcification means most people can\u2019t entertain a vote for the other side, so 2024 should look a lot like 2016 and 2020.\n\nWhat will it take for Biden or Trump to win that increasingly smaller pool of swing voters?\n\nTrump probably has to continue to rally his base by appealing to identity-inflected topics and also blame Biden for what feels like a sluggish economy. Biden\u2019s job is to sell his economic recovery from the pandemic and remind people how awful 2020 and its aftermath was \u2014 and how all of that feels like ancient history now (for most people). This will be hard because explaining why most people felt more flush under Trump relative to under Biden is complicated and requires explanation. And one of my favorite rules of politics is, \u201cif you\u2019re explaining, you\u2019re losing.\u201d\n\nWhat issues do Americans for the most part agree on, if any?\n\nThere are some policy positions that most people would like to see enacted into legislation. Universal gun background checks is the one I think of first. A majority of people in both parties want it. Paid maternity leave and a $15 minimum wage are others. None of them, however, are among the most important things voters care about right now.\n\nGiven your research, what advice do you have for the undecided voter?\n\nBe sure you know what policies each party wants to enact into legislation on the issues you care about and vote accordingly. The parties want to build very different worlds; you don\u2019t want to get this wrong.\n\nIs there any other question regarding your research that you would want to be asked at this time by a reporter, given where we are in April of a presidential election year? If so, please pose the question and answer it.\n\nI would only add that Trump has been in the news so frequently for the last several months because of his court cases that this has likely activated his supporters in a way that mimics the heart of a campaign period. Biden has not been in the same position, so one of the things that is possible is that Biden\u2019s voters have not yet been activated to show up and support their candidate, because they haven\u2019t had to yet. This may be why the gap in the polls is bigger than people expect it to be. The election is a long way off and the campaigns haven\u2019t started yet. When they do, both sets of voters will engage, and then we will get a proper read on the state of the contest.",

        "text": "Office of Elections\nHawaii Elections\n\nHawaii conducts statewide elections in even-numbered years. The primary election is held on the second Saturday in August and the general election is held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November.\n\nView the election calendar for dates and deadlines.\n\nPursuant to Act 136, SLH 2019, elections are conducted by mail. All registered voters automatically receive their ballot in the mail approximately eighteen (18) days prior to the election. Ballots are sent to the mailing address provided with the voter's voter registration. To register or update your voter registration, visit Voter Registration.\n\nPrimary Election\n\nThe primary election nominates candidates to represent political parties in the general election. Similarly, candidates who do not belong to a political party will be nominated to the general election by meeting the qualifications as a nonpartisan candidate running in a partisan contest.\n\nHawaii voters do not declare a political affiliation with the voter registration pursuant to the Hawaii State Constitution, ensuring every voter's right to secrecy. On the primary election ballot, voters must first select a political affiliation and then vote for candidates of the political affiliation of their choice only.\n\nVoters may also vote for candidates for the Office of Hawaiian Affairs and county contests regardless of party affiliation.\n\nGeneral Election\n\nThe general election is a candidate contest, meaning that voters may vote for the candidate of their choice regardless of political affiliation. Voters will select federal, state, county, and Office of Hawaiian Affairs candidates, as well as State Constitutional Amendments and/or Charter Amendments.\n\nPresidential Elections\n\nHawaii does not conduct a presidential preference primary. The political parties independently conduct presidential caucuses to nominate candidates for president and vice-president. For information on how to participate in the party-run presidential caucuses, contact the qualified political parties directly. The Electoral College elects the president and vice-president of the United States. Learn more about the Electoral College.\n\nRanked-Choice Voting\n\nAny federal election not held on the date of a regularly scheduled primary or general election and any special election for a vacant seat on a county council shall be conducted by ranked-choice voting. HRS \u00a7 11-100.\n\nWhat is ranked-choice voting?\n\nRanked-choice voting\" is the method of casting and tabulating votes in which voters rank candidates in order of preference, tabulation proceeds in sequential rounds in which last-place candidates are defeated, and the candidate with the most votes in the final round is elected.\" HRS \u00a7\u00a7 11-110(e).\n\nSpecific statutory procedures are followed in each round. HRS \u00a7\u00a7 11-110(b)-(d).\n\nHow does ranked-choice voting work?\n\nIf a candidate receives a majority of votes, 50 percent plus one, in the first round, that candidate wins. However, if no candidate receives a majority of votes, the votes of the defeated candidate(s) are redistributed.\n\nIn each round, the candidate with the lowest number of votes is defeated. Those votes are then redistributed as votes for the continuing candidates, counting for the voter\u2019s next ranked candidate in the following round.\n\nThis process of redistributing votes continues until a candidate reaches a majority of the votes.\n\nRegistering to Vote\n\nTo register to vote in the State of Hawaii, you must be:\n\nA U.S. Citizen\n\nA resident of Hawaii\n\nAt least sixteen (16) years old. Hawaii law allows qualified individuals to pre-register at sixteen (16) years of age. Upon reaching eighteen (18) years of age, they will be automatically registered and mailed a ballot.\n\n\n\nLearn more about Voter Registration.\n\nVoting by Mail\n\nKeep Your Voter Registration Current\n\nBallots are mailed to the mailing address associated with your voter registration. If you move to a new residence, change your mailing address or name, you must update your voter registration. You may check online or contact your County Elections Division to confirm that your registration record is current.\n\nReceiving Your Ballot\n\nYou will receive a mail ballot packet at least 18 days prior to the election.\n\nYour packet consists of a ballot, ballot secrecy sleeve, and a prepaid postage return ballot envelope.\n\nVoters with special needs may request for an electronic ballot through the Voter Registration Application or by contacting their County Elections Division. Click here to learn more about voting with an accessible electronic ballot.\n\nReturning Your Ballot\n\nYou may return your voted ballot by mail or in person at a designated place of deposit within your county. Voted ballots must be received by your County Elections Division by 7:00 p.m. on Election Day.\n\nTracking Your Ballot\n\nYou may check on the status of your ballot, whether it has been mailed and/or received, by contacting your County Elections Division. Additionally, you may sign up with BallotTrax to receive ballot notifications.\n\nProcessing Your Ballot\n\nUpon receipt of your return envelope, your County Elections Division validates the signature to confirm your identity. After your signature is validated, your ballot will be forwarded to state election officials to be counted.\n\nVoting at a Voter Service Center\n\nThe County Elections Divisions establish voter service centers that will be open 10 days prior and on Election Day. Services include accessible in person voting and same day registration.\n\nIf you require special assistance (i.e. large print, taped materials, etc.) contact the Office of Elections at 453-VOTE (8683).\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nHow do I vote?\n\nYou must be a registered voter to receive a ballot. Then, you will receive your ballot in the mail. To vote, review the instructions, contests, and candidates on your ballot and make your selections. You can also leave a contest blank and it will not impact your votes.\n\nAfter voting, fold the ballot and slip it into the ballot secrecy sleeve.

        "text": "Union Petitions Up 35%, Unfair Labor Practices Charge Filings Up 7% in the First Half of Fiscal Year 2024\nDuring the first six months of Fiscal Year 2024 (October 1\u2013March 31), union election petitions filed at NLRB field offices rose 35% over the same period in Fiscal Year 2023. Notably, this is driven by a spike in employer-filed RM-petitions, after the Board\u2019s Cemex decision, accompanied by an uptick in employee-filed RC-petitions. In total, 1,618 petitions were filed during this time, compared with 1,199 in the first half of Fiscal Year 2023. Of the recent petitions, 1,137 were RC-petitions and 281 were RM-petitions.\n\nAt the same time, unfair labor practice (ULP) charges filed across the NLRB\u2019s field offices have increased 7%\u2014from 9,612 to 10,278. Accounting for union petitions and unfair labor practice charges, the NLRB received 11,896 cases in the first half of Fiscal Year 2024, up 10% over the first half of Fiscal Year 2023 when the field offices received 10,811 cases.\n\nThis increase in filings continues the surge in NLRB caseload in recent years. In Fiscal Year 2023, ULP charges were up 10% and election petitions were up 3% over the previous year. In Fiscal Year 2022, union petitions were up 53% and ULP charges filed increased 19% over Fiscal Year 2021.\n\nThe surge in caseload occurs as the Agency struggles with funding and staffing shortages. Last month, Congress flat-funded the NLRB at $299.2 million at a time when more resources are desperately needed. Last year, Congress gave the NLRB a $25 million increase, which ended a hiring freeze, prevented furloughs, and allowed the NLRB to backfill some critical staff vacancies. However, the Agency remains understaffed after flat funding in nine of the past 10 years. In the past two decades, staffing in field offices has shrunk by 50%.\n\n\u201cAs the NLRB\u2019s case intake reflects a critical moment in our nation\u2019s history, I\u2019m proud of NLRB Field and Headquarters staff for processing cases with professionalism and care,\u201d said NLRB General Counsel Jennifer Abruzzo. \u201cHowever, Congress needs to fully fund the NLRB to effectively and efficiently comply with our Congressional mandate when providing quality service to the public in conducting hearings and elections, investigating charges, settling and litigating meritorious cases, and obtaining full and prompt remedies for workers whose rights are violated.\u201d",

        "text": "The U.S. Presidential Election: What\u2019s at Stake for Democracy Globally\nThe U.S. presidential election this year will have the greatest potential impact on democratic movements and institutions around the world. American voters have now chosen two candidates for the office with two different attitudes toward the traditional global order, democratic governance, and the rule of law. To underline the implications on democratic norms globally, the Center for the Study of Democracy organized the online discussion \u201cThe U.S. Presidential Election: What\u2019s at Stake for Democracy Globally\u201d, held on April 8.\n\nThe event brought together star line-up from the Wall Street Journal:\n\nJohn Bussey, Associate Editor \u2013 New York, The Wall Street Journal;\n\nAaron Zitner, Reporter and Editor, Washington Bureau \u2013 Washington, D.C., The Wall Street Journal;\n\nGerald F. Seib, Former Washington Bureau Chief \u2013 Washington D.C., The Wall Street Journal; and\n\nDeborah Ball, Deputy Editor of World News \u2013 London, The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe discussion highlighted the political shift from Ronald Reagan's conservatism to Donald Trump's populism in the U.S., underscoring a dramatic change where the Republican Party now appeals more to a working-class demographic, marking a departure from its traditional base. This shift is intertwined with broader global phenomena such as economic globalization, the 2008 financial crisis, unresolved immigration issues, and a surge in populism, all of which pose significant challenges to the fabric of democracy.",

        "text": "A Shift in Power: CHP Win Ushers in Recalibration in Turkish Politics\nThe Turkish local elections on March 31 were a real game-changer. The Justice and Development Party (AKP), led by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, did not put up a credible challenge to Republican People's Party (CHP) candidates in cities like Istanbul and Ankara and came second in total overall votes. The CHP not only came first\u2014a feat not achieved since the 1977 general elections\u2014but also secured a victory in almost all major cities in Turkey, including a province it had not won since 1946. Overall, the elections brought fresh energy to the opposition, positioning Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu at the center of Turkish politics.\n\nIn stark contrast to the pervasive disillusionment that characterized last year's May 14 presidential elections\u2014where a profound sense of apathy, particularly among the youth, prevailed\u2014 the local elections somewhat mitigated that wave of despair for the moment.\n\nElection night\n\nIt was a surprising night for many. The CHP won in 36 out of Turkey's 81 municipalities, making significant inroads into many of Erdogan's strongholds. It garnered 38% of the national vote, slightly edging out the president's party at 35%, marking the CHP's most substantial electoral triumph since Erdogan's ascent to power over two decades ago.\n\nTurkey's recent economic troubles played a big part, tipping the scales in favor of the opposition.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to this political shift. Turkey's recent economic troubles played a big part, tipping the scales in favor of the opposition. The country has been wrestling with serious financial issues since 2018, such as skyrocketing inflation and a lack of foreign currency reserves. These problems, in addition to the Erdogan government\u2019s austerity measures, have hit the wallets of ordinary people hard and sparked a lot of frustration with the government's approach to the economy.\n\nThe opposition jumped on this dissatisfaction. They criticized Erdogan's handling of the economy and promised to bring more transparency and effectiveness to public spending and local governance. Istanbul's Imamoglu had been implementing several policies, such as establishing restaurants that provide cheap yet quality food, distributing subsidized milk to school children, and providing free public transportation for mothers with children under 4 to bring relief to those battered by the harsh economic conditions.\n\nAs for the CHP, the overhaul in its leadership in November was pivotal. The election of new CHP leader Ozgur Ozel, alongside the opposition's key figure Ekrem Imamoglu and their respective teams, infused a fresh dynamism and direction, resonating deeply with voters.\n\nDespite the element of surprise for many, including observers from the international community, the mood at CHP headquarters on the evening of the election was distinctly upbeat. Nezih Onur Kuru, Director of the Research Department at the CHP Electoral Strategy Office, said, \"The CHP undertook thorough preparations for this election, devising a strategy anchored in solid data gathered from various districts throughout Turkey.\" In Istanbul, according to Kuru, the collaboration with the DEM Party via an informal coalition was instrumental in amplifying Imamoglu's vote tally while simultaneously securing additional seats for the CHP in the municipal council.\n\nIn essence, Kuru emphasized that the election outcomes were anticipated by those within the CHP headquarters, given the continuous polling throughout the campaign period. The new leadership underscored the CHP's commitment to transformation and readiness to govern, culminating in a significant triumph. However, the CHP wasn't the only winner of the election night.\n\nNew party prospects\n\nThe rise of the New Welfare Party (YRP), a new, far-right Islamist party, significantly impacted the elections by attracting disillusioned AKP supporters unhappy with the government's economic policies as well as Turkey's ongoing trade with Israel. The YRP's emergence as a formidable force, despite significant pressure from Erdogan to align with AKP, effectively siphoned a substantial portion of votes away from AKP.\n\nThe Peoples' Equality and Democracy Party (DEM Party), successor to the pro-Kurdish People\u2019s Democratic Party (HDP), successfully reversed its declining voter support since the 2015 elections. This success contrasts with the failure of the AKP-led governance, which relied on trustee-based politics. Despite attempts to criminalize the DEM Party, Kurdish opposition remains vibrant. The DEM Party's performance in local elections, winning in 12 municipalities and increasing votes in others, demonstrates dissatisfaction with trustee politics among Kurds.\n\nA significant portion of the supporters of the ruling AKP-MHP coalition did not vote, likely in protest. Despite increasing voter registration, the same amount of people voted as in previous elections, indicating a lack of enthusiasm for this round. The decrease in turnout suggests potential dissatisfaction among AKP voters, primarily attributed to ongoing economic and political crises.\n\nFor Erdogan, the elections spelled a stark reversal of fortune, marking the first time AKP fell to the second spot since its foundation. This outcome is a significant blow to the AKP's image, relegating it to Turkey's second party.\n\nThe Imamoglu effect\n\nIstanbul and its districts were particularly significant in this election. The acquisition of the city council by the CHP will remove obstacles for Ekrem Imamoglu, paving the way for new projects and potentially more effective governance compared to the previous five years, wherein AKP councilmembers blocked numerous policies such as the procurement of new taxis for the city.\n\nSince a significant portion (26 out of 39) of Istanbul's districts are now under CHP control, impactful projects in the metropolitan area have become feasible. The economic challenges highlight how crucial local governance is, especially since local authorities are key in delivering basic services and fostering economic opportunities.\n\nThe long-term effects of the elections on the political landscape are yet to unfold, yet it seems tougher days are ahead for Erdogan and his AKP. Imamoglu, having secured a decisive win and maintained his position in the recent mayoral elections, now stands as a likely contender for the presidency in the future, despite Erdogan's vigorous campaign efforts for the AKP. The president's attempt to win back Turkey's largest city was marked by significant attention from state-aligned media towards the AKP's candidate, Murat Kurum, and efforts from top ministers to engage Istanbul's populace directly.\n\nImamoglu's victory marks a significant shift. According to Kemal Buyukyuksel, Senior Analyst at the CHP Electoral Strategy Office, Imamoglu's success, in addition to his popular policies in Istanbul, stems from his ability to extend the social democratic CHP's appeal beyond its typical base of support (usually 25% of voters), attracting conservative and Kurdish voters alike. Buyukyuksel attributes this success to Imamoglu's focus on impactful policies over grand projects aimed at public relations, as well as his unifying personality.\n\nThe Turkish local elections will usher in a period of political recalibration in Turkey, with the next presidential election four years down the road.\n\nThe Turkish local elections will usher in a period of political recalibration in Turkey, with the next presidential election four years down the road. This shift will prompt the global community to reevaluate its stance towards Turkey in light of emerging leaders and evolving political landscapes. The opposition's significant win provides a boost of morale, hope, and encouragement, particularly for those worried about the erosion of democratic principles in the nation. For Erdogan, the challenge ahead lies in tackling an economy that desperately requires intervention, presenting a steep climb.\n\nThe views expressed in these articles are those of the author and do not reflect an official position of the Wilson Center.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Emerging Powers and the Future of American Statecraft\nMuch existing thinking about the ten emerging powers\u2019 various alignments with China and Russia emphasizes the influence of economic interests. Economic interests do play an important role in shaping their desire to have positive relations with China and, in many cases, with Russia, but they are not the only factor that matters. The emerging powers\u2019 views of what constitutes a just international order, their geographies, their defense relationships, and, in some cases, their domestic politics also play a role. Chinese and Russian propaganda and disinformation also have some influence on them, although this should not be exaggerated. One factor that does not appear to drive the emerging powers is a concern about the state of democracy and human rights in other countries. Tables 4 and 5 summarize the analysis that follows.\n\nEconomic Interests\n\nEconomic interests play a key role in shaping the ten emerging powers\u2019 positions on China and Russia. As developing countries, they are less able to absorb the economic costs of international conflict. For many, their economies have been more vulnerable to the inflationary shock to food prices that the war in Ukraine caused. In addition, they see important future gains from economic cooperation with China and Russia, especially where that promises investment or technology. They also derive a large share of their GDP from exports, which can make them highly vulnerable to external economic disruptions. For example, Brazil\u2019s agricultural and food sector generates about one-third of its GDP, and Nigeria and Saudi Arabia are heavily dependent on oil exports.1 Their capacity to absorb shocks, such as the one that Europe underwent to end its reliance on Russian energy, is more limited than that of the developed economies of Asia and the West. All of this makes them disinclined to sacrifice economic ties with Russia or China.\n\nEconomic Relations With Russia\n\nWhen it came to Ukraine, economic interests were key factors that encouraged Brazil, India, T\u00fcrkiye, and Saudi Arabia to preserve ties to Russia. Some of the emerging powers were driven by the desire to maintain a specific economic relationship. Others were driven by a general concern about the economic impact of the war. And some were driven by economic opportunities created by the sanctions regime on Russia.\n\nBecause their economies are more fragile than, say, those of the G7 countries and are very much tied to the global economy, the emerging powers have less ability to absorb the economic effects of the war. They have faced disproportionate economic consequences, including high energy prices, food scarcity, and inflation.2\n\nBrazil\u2019s reliance on Russia for one-quarter of its fertilizer imports appears to have been a key factor that dissuaded it from backing the West\u2019s anti-Russia coalition.3 If Russia were to cut these exports, it would damage Brazil\u2019s agricultural output and harm its economy.4 Nigeria, Thailand, and Indonesia are heavily reliant on Russia and Ukraine for fertilizer and wheat and desperately want the war to end so that supply chains can be restored.5 Shipments of Russian wheat to Nigeria have dwindled to almost nothing as a consequence of the war, prompting a food security crisis.6 In Indonesia, the war led to shortages of Indomie instant noodles, raising the price of an affordable staple. When Jokowi visited Kyiv and Moscow in June 2022, Indonesians called it an \u201cIndomie mission\u201d\u2014a clear indication of how important food supply chain disruptions were to their country.7\n\nA few of their leaders blamed Western sanctions as much as they blamed Russia\u2019s invasion for this situation. South Africa\u2019s Ramaphosa, for example, warned in May 2022 that sanctions would lead \u201cbystander\u201d countries that are \u201cnot part of the conflict\u201d to suffer.8 Indeed, the global economic damage of the war is in part a consequence of Russia\u2019s threat to Ukraine\u2019s grain exports, but Western sanctions have played a part in intensifying the damage for many countries.9 Most of the emerging powers have seen their neighbors sanctioned by the United States. (T\u00fcrkiye itself has been sanctioned.) And they oppose such extraterritoriality, seeing the sanctions as a coercive violation of national sovereignty. Their decision not to join the sanctions regime on Russia is consistent with their long-standing opposition to sanctions in general, which is tied to their critiques of the structure of the current global order.10\n\nThe sanctions regime created economic opportunities for some of the emerging powers that they did not want to miss. For example, India\u2019s low per capita GDP and enormous demand for energy made it difficult to say no to the cheap energy Russia offered. As Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar put it, wealthy European countries were able to wean themselves from Russian oil imports in a way that was \u201ccomfortable,\u201d but \u201cI have a population at $2,000 [per capita annual income]. I also need energy, and I am not in a position to pay high prices for oil.\u201d11 Saudi Arabia similarly capitalized on the war by coordinating oil production cuts with OPEC+ and raking in extra profits.12 T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s initial increase in illicit exports to Russia can be put in the same category\u2014even though Ankara eventually tightened up controls.\n\nEconomic Relations With China\n\nEconomic interests loom no less large in the ten emerging powers\u2019 approaches to China, which uses its robust economic ties to increase its bargaining power with them as it does with other countries around the world.13\n\nEconomic ties are a key factor in the embrace of China by eight of these countries. In Argentina, Brazil, Indonesia, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Thailand, and T\u00fcrkiye, China has funded high-speed railways, seaports, 5G networks, nickel plants, renewable energy infrastructure, nuclear power plants, and more, mostly through the BRI. The economic and technological benefits they gain from China can make them hesitant to do anything that might antagonize Beijing, lest they lose out on future loans, investment, and trade. The United States has sought to draw attention to the problems that some countries have encountered with BRI financing, but this cannot counteract the benefits that emerging powers gain from it.14 China\u2019s claim that BRI-related growth has lifted 42 million people out of poverty is dubious, but it is clear that the initiative has expanded trade and connectivity, generated jobs, and enhanced development in most recipient countries.15\n\nEconomic ties have created pro-China constituencies in the emerging powers that are able to pressure the government to maintain positive relations with Beijing. For example, Brazil\u2019s agribusiness caucus pressures its government to deepen relations with China, its top importer.16 Such lobbies can constrain the range of action governments can take toward China without sacrificing domestic political support.\n\nChina also wields economic power through coercive measures, such as by threatening economic costs for nations that challenge its interests.17 The potential for such measures provides influence with the emerging powers, even though economic coercion can sometimes backfire.18 Most of the emerging powers have robust economic ties with the United States and thus seek a middle ground between the two powers. As discussed above, most of them receive more U.S. than Chinese investment but trade more with China than the United States. This makes them inclined to balance between the two powers and avoid situations in which they would have to make a choice.\n\nViews of International Order\n\nFor most of the ten emerging powers, economic interests converge with other motives in shaping their degree of alignment with China and Russia. One of the more important is their views of international order, which make them hesitant to isolate and exclude Russia from international forums and broadly supportive of China\u2019s critiques of the existing world order and its U.S.-led institutions.\n\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine, most Western countries saw this as the most brazen violation of international rules since World War II. U.S. President Joe Biden said that the war was part of \u201ca battle between democracy and autocracy, between liberty and repression, between a rules-based order and one governed by brute force.\u201d19 In his view, the international community had to support Ukraine in order to uphold the norms and laws that prohibit the use of force to change international borders.\n\nThe emerging powers, however, are skeptical that the United States is really concerned about the future of the rules-based international order, especially in light of the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq and recent support for Israel\u2019s bombing of Gaza. They view the war in Ukraine as springing from a decades-long NATO-Russia standoff over power in Europe, rather than a struggle over the principles of world order.20 They are thus inclined to resist U.S. demands that they sacrifice economic and political ties with China and Russia in defense of the current world order.21\n\nIn their view, a functioning international order would provide an institutional structure for working out conflicts without violence, including between warring states.22 To be sure, they do not have detailed plans for what the various components of a reformed international order ought to be, but they do have general views about what it should look like and have embraced some specific ideas for reform. They share qualms about the post-1945 international order, which they view as unfairly dominated by the former colonial powers in the West, and the United States in particular. Since Russia invaded Ukraine, for example, they have disliked the resurgence of the G7\u2014which U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan has called the \u201csteering committee of the free world\u201d\u2014because it seems to imply that the United States believes world affairs should be run primarily by a few wealthy Western economies, many of which were once colonial powers.23\n\nThese countries thus want to see greater equality on the UN Security Council, through the addition of more permanent members and an end to veto power, which they see as ineffective and undemocratic.24 They have long championed its enlargement, with Brazil and India aspiring for permanent seats and several countries calling for a permanent African representative.25 Historically, the United States has opposed enlargement of the Security Council, but the Biden administration has made an effort to build momentum behind the addition of at least six new permanent members.26 These countries also advocate reforms of the Bretton Woods institutions, including a redivision of the International Monetary Fund\u2019s quotas so that voting power is proportionate to each country\u2019s relative economic weight.27 Brazil says that a lack of reform in these financial institutions is driving the developing world toward China-led institutions such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the New Development Bank.28\n\nThe emerging powers also object to what they see as the uneven application of the rules and norms of the system. They criticize, for example, the way in which sovereignty\u2014a core principle of the UN Charter\u2014has been violated by the United States and thus view Western entreaties to support Ukraine as hypocritical.29 Similarly, they view the unilateral use of sanctions as violations of sovereignty that are inconsistent with the spirit of the existing order. U.S. third-party sanctions that do not have UN backing are particularly problematic for them.30 They take Washington\u2019s claims that it uses these tools to promote values such as human rights and democracy as justifications for its raw application of power.\n\nThe desire to change the system of global governance also influences their approaches to China. Part of what drives many developing countries toward the BRICS and the New Development Bank is the prospect of building up alternatives to older forums and institutions of the U.S.-led international order. Many of the emerging powers are positive about the rise of China if it results in a shake-up of this order, dilutes the institutional power of the United States and the West, and elevates their role on the world stage. This explains a statement by Brazil\u2019s Lula in 2023 that he and Chinese President Xi Jinping were working together to \u201cbalance world geopolitics,\u201d as well as former Argentine president Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s call in 2022 for the construction of a \u201cnew international financial architecture\u201d that accounts for developing countries\u2019 interests.31\n\nThe emerging powers nonetheless appreciate the importance of international law and existing multilateral institutions, given their weakness relative to the world\u2019s major powers. For many of them, a history of colonial rule or subjugation to foreign powers leads to embracing the UN Charter\u2019s principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity as well as opposing the use of force.32 Even if economic interests are as or more influential on their positions, these alternative visions of a just world are a meaningful factor behind their differences with the West, particularly on the question of Ukraine.\n\nGeography\n\nGeography plays a key role in shaping the positions of the ten emerging powers, in large part because of its impact on their security interests and economic flows but also because it affects historical attitudes and other influences. Geography\u2019s impact will be difficult for emerging powers to overcome. Proximity to a great power in particular creates various interests and vulnerabilities. Being near China, Russia, or the United States tends to make emerging powers adjust their policies to shield themselves from the actions of these great powers and avoid punitive measures.\n\nT\u00fcrkiye is the only country among the emerging powers to be in close proximity to the war in Ukraine. Ankara thus has an interest in helping Ukraine fight back against Russia\u2019s onslaught, but its proximity also obliges it to keep diplomatic channels open with Russia.33 Due to this proximity, T\u00fcrkiye and Russia also have a historical relationship dating back centuries. The Ottoman Empire was initially the dominant power in the region, but Russia encroached on and eventually absorbed large amounts of its territory during the eighteenth century. These realities have encouraged T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s middle-of-the-road stance on the war. Ankara has sought to play a leading role in negotiations between Russia and the West, for example, on the Black Sea Grain Initiative.\n\nGeography helps explain why Indonesia and Thailand make efforts to maintain good relations with China despite their different interests, whereas Mexico has been less concerned about doing so. For India, on one level, geography pushes New Delhi toward Washington as its border dispute with Beijing is a real source of tension and it sees itself as China\u2019s major regional competitor. At the same time, however, proximity also makes India much more exposed to retaliation from China than U.S. partners in other regions, which restrains it from throwing its whole weight behind U.S. military plans for the region, including when it comes to Taiwan.34 India\u2019s leaders are suspicious of China and view the countries\u2019 relationship as highly competitive, but they also are not keen for open conflict in the region, let alone on their border.35\n\nSimilarly, Indonesia\u2019s sprawling archipelagic geography in Southeast Asia and close proximity to China makes it especially wary about U.S.-China competition and the militarization of the Indo-Pacific.36 This, together with a troubled history with Australia, is the root of its hesitation about the United States\u2019 plan to provide Australia with nuclear submarines under the AUKUS agreement.37 Even though Indonesia has an ongoing territorial dispute with China in the South China Sea, it does not want the United States to get involved.38 Its position on U.S.-China competition is also informed by its history as a leader of the nonaligned movement during the Cold War. Thailand, for its part, has no territorial disputes with China, but its embrace of Chinese weapons and security cooperation is shaped by proximity as well.39\n\nGeography makes Mexico less likely to embrace China. It has a nearly 2,000-mile border with the United States, with which it cooperates on the cross-border movement of people and goods and which is its top trading partner.40 If Mexico were to significantly elevate its relationship with China, the United States would almost certainly retaliate.\n\nDefense Relations\n\nExisting and potential future weapons sales are an important factor shaping the positions of some of the ten emerging powers toward China and Russia. Costs, path dependency, and a desire to avoid dependence on Western arms all play a role in this.\n\nEven though its military ties with the United States have deepened in recent years, India has not ended its long-standing defense relationship with Russia and likely will not anytime soon.41 Russian weapons systems are cheaper than U.S. systems, and those that India already has are not easily replaced by U.S. arms. Moreover, New Delhi is not keen to develop a dependence on U.S. weapons, even as it seeks to benefit from closer defense cooperation with the country.42 The desire to balance against not just China but also the United States will likely factor in India\u2019s future procurement plans.\n\nT\u00fcrkiye acquired Russia\u2019s advanced S-400 missile defense system before the invasion of Ukraine, thus linking a key part of its national defense closely to the Russian military. After the acquisition, the United States sanctioned T\u00fcrkiye and removed it from the F-35 joint strike fighter program. Washington has told Ankara it can rejoin the F-35 \u201cfamily\u201d if it gives up the S-400 system, but Ankara seems set on retaining it.43 If T\u00fcrkiye keeps the system, operating it will require sustained cooperation with the Russian military.44 As a NATO member, T\u00fcrkiye is far more dependent on the West for its military equipment, but its acquisition of the S-400 is one consideration that makes it inclined to ensure friendly relations with Russia.\n\nNigeria has been purchasing more weapons from China, in part due to U.S. restrictions on weapons sales to states that do not meet certain human rights standards.45 Even if it prefers the more technologically advanced American weapons, Nigeria may see China as an easier source because it does place any human rights conditions.46 It has recently sought Beijing\u2019s help to fight a domestic insurgency, and it has signaled its interest in intelligence sharing, technology transfers, and joint training.47 The two countries have also announced plans to establish a Chinese military equipment firm in Nigeria. These defense ties likely shape Nigeria\u2019s policy calculations and make the country unlikely to side with the United States against China.\n\nBut weapons sales and defense relations do not appear to be important in other cases. Brazil\u2019s positions on China and Russia cannot be explained by defense ties. It is the leading military power in Latin America and has long invested in its defense industry, prioritizing ties to European producers such as France and Sweden.48 Indonesia has preserved friendly relations with Russia even as it has moved away from relying on its military equipment, dropping a plan to procure the Russian Su-35 fighter aircraft and turning instead to France for the Rafale.49 It increasingly imports military supplies from the United States, South Korea, and Europe.50\n\nIn general, arms sales are less important in explaining emerging powers\u2019 ties to China than they are in explaining their ties to Russia, a reflection of the fact that the former is a newer player in this global market. This could change if the desirability of Russian arms continues to decline and China remains a viable alternative to U.S. weapons for some nations.51\n\nDomestic Politics\n\nAs with many countries, domestic politics often plays a role in shaping the positions the emerging powers take in their foreign policies. The effects are naturally greatest for countries with democratic regimes, where the effects of populism, anti-colonialism, anti-Americanism, and nationalism all shape rhetoric and decisionmaking.\n\nPopulist politics, for example, has shaped Mexico\u2019s and Brazil\u2019s approaches to Russia. Mexico\u2019s L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s criticisms of U.S. policy on the Ukraine war were at least in part an expedient way for him to boost domestic support by vocally asserting Mexico\u2019s sovereignty and independence from America. He has long used criticism of the United States to play to a domestic elite audience that can be deeply skeptical of American motives and values (even if most Mexicans have favorable opinion on the United States).52 Lula\u2019s embrace of China and Russia is also a means of projecting Brazil\u2019s independence from the United States for a domestic audience and appeasing powerful, pro-China interest groups.53 A change in government might yield a somewhat different tone, but the nativist and anti-American currents on which Lula and L\u00f3pez Obrador are playing are real in both countries.\n\nBrazilian President Lula da Silva (then a presidential candidate) waves to a crowd at a campaign rally on October 9, 2022\n\nDomestic political dynamics in the emerging powers do not always play against the United States. None of these nations are eager to be subservient to China: just as nationalism and a desire for sovereignty leads them to resist America\u2019s dominance, it will also lead them to resist China\u2019s. Moreover, this will likely be more the case as China\u2019s power grows\u2014this may explain why, despite Lula\u2019s embrace of China, many Brazilians are worried that Brazil could drift too far into China\u2019s orbit.54\n\nFor now, however, most of these countries\u2019 leaders are likely to get more political benefits out of poking Washington rather than Beijing. Many of the emerging powers have strong memories of colonialism that affect their politics and thinking about the foreign policy of the United States and its European allies, some of which engaged in some of the most egregious sins of the colonial era. Anti-colonial sentiment may be less salient today, but it remains part of the political culture of many of the emerging powers. China stands to benefit from this because it was also dominated by European colonial powers in the nineteenth century and thus has an understanding of how colonialism continues to affect the emerging powers\u2019 worldviews. Meanwhile, Russia continues to benefit from the legacies of Soviet anti-imperialist propaganda. The colonial past also brings race into the equation, and China may be able to play on racial themes to make its case against the United States, particularly in a time when racial tensions have flared in the United States.\n\nColonial legacies, especially that of the unequal and often exploitative relationship that existed between the West and the rest of the world, will continue to make the emerging powers skeptical of the claims and aims of the United States in its approach to them. Even where it was not a colonial power, America will be at a disadvantage in making its case to many of the emerging powers on account of their colonial subservience to many of its European allies.\n\nRussian and Chinese Propaganda\n\nSome analysts have emphasized the role of propaganda, especially Russian disinformation, in shaping the policies of the ten emerging powers.55 Russian disinformation is real and China\u2019s propaganda efforts have also grown more robust in recent years, but the United States should be wary of mistaking genuine differences of national interest with the ten emerging powers for misunderstandings stemming from these propaganda efforts.\n\nRussia is especially adept at shaping the information space by saturating local news and social media platforms with pro-Russia and anti-NATO messages.56 It also plays on grievances against the West and capitalizes on the history of Soviet support for anti-colonial movements.57 Some of the emerging powers are more receptive to Russia\u2019s messaging, particularly those where Moscow continues to enjoy a positive image due to Soviet-era legacies. For example, the African National Congress tends to sympathize with Russian narratives due to the Soviet Union\u2019s support for the party during South Africa\u2019s anti-apartheid struggle.58 Russian disinformation can also stoke and exploit sometimes dangerous divisions inside nations.59\n\nChina\u2019s propaganda and influence operations are less sophisticated than Russia\u2019s but growing.60 It has recently expanded its capacity to disseminate its messages through state-run news agencies such as Xinhua and China Global Television News (CGTN).61 Xinhua now has thirty-seven bureaus in Africa, outnumbering all other media agencies on the continent.62 Most of its content aims to promote positive views of China, cast it as a benign alternative to the United States, and normalize its territorial claims over Taiwan and other contested areas.63 There is evidence that China\u2019s propaganda efforts may make populations in Africa and Latin America more sympathetic to its political and economic model, but the effects on the overall alignment of these countries\u2019 foreign policies appear minimal.64\n\nThere is no evidence that the presence of CGTN or Russia\u2019s RT shapes the emerging powers\u2019 foreign policy decisions in meaningful ways. To begin with, the effects of Chinese and Russian disinformation in these countries, while difficult to measure with any precision, appear limited to reinforcing preexisting tropes about Western imperialism or other historical legacies.65 The measurable effects on public opinion are not very significant, at least when it comes to Russian efforts, where there is data: a 2022 poll of 137 countries shows that Global South opinions of Russia have declined significantly since the invasion of Ukraine.66 In Latin America, for instance, where Russian propaganda has been prevalent, disapproval of Russia climbed from an average of 31 percent in 2021 to 61 percent in 2022.67 Moreover, it is unclear whether slightly more positive public views of China and Russia due to disinformation would have a significant impact on the emerging powers\u2019 foreign policy positions. In short, the role of disinformation should not obscure that, more often, the emerging powers\u2019 national interests drive them toward China or Russia.68\n\nThere is thus a risk that the United States will place excessive emphasis on the effects of Russian or Chinese disinformation in an information environment polluted by propaganda that casts U.S. policies in a negative light. Washington could do a better job of conveying its intentions and explaining its policies, but many of the emerging powers will lean toward China and Russia on many issues regardless. For example, emerging powers\u2019 views on the war in Ukraine cannot be meaningfully explained as the consequence of Russian disinformation. To view U.S. differences with the emerging powers as the result of disinformation by U.S. adversaries can be pernicious for the United States because it suggests paternalism and reinforces their view of it as a neocolonial power.\n\nDemocracy and Human Rights\n\nDefending and promoting democracy and human rights is one factor that plays a significant role in the West\u2019s approach to Russia and, to a lesser degree, China. This is not the case when it comes to the ten emerging powers. Their voting on UN resolutions indicates some concern about human rights, but that concern did not fundamentally alter their approaches to either Russia or China. For Saudi Arabia, T\u00fcrkiye, and Thailand, this could be explained by the fact that they are not democracies. Saudi Arabia itself has a bad human rights record. But even the more established democracies\u2014Argentina, Brazil, India, Mexico, and South Africa\u2014have not taken notably different positions on China and Russia. Interests supersede values when it comes to how the emerging powers approach the world. For example, Indonesia, has the world\u2019s largest Muslim population, but it has not spoken out against China\u2019s persecution of Uyghur Muslims in the Xinjiang region; Indonesia even blocked a resolution to debate this issue at the UN Human Rights Council in 2022.69 When asked if it was difficult for his country to criticize China, Jokowi said, \u201cIndonesia wants stability.\u201d70\n\nEven where the emerging powers voice concerns about human rights, this does not preclude them from maintaining friendly relations with the country in question. For example, T\u00fcrkiye has spoken out against China\u2019s policies against the Uyghur population, and it has rejected Beijing\u2019s requests to extradite Uyghurs from T\u00fcrkiye.71 But Ankara has nevertheless compartmentalized the issue to prevent it from affecting other aspects of its relationship with Beijing.\n\nDemocratic affinity with the United States does not increase the likelihood of the emerging powers aligning with it on China or Russia. For instance, despite Washington\u2019s strong support for the integrity of the election that brought Lula back to power in Brazil, the country has not aligned more closely with the United States on China\u2014in fact, it has moved in the opposite direction.72\n\nThe emerging powers often also have an abiding skepticism about the West\u2019s efforts to universalize liberalism and mold non-Western states in the shape of its democratic model. They tend to be pragmatic about the world\u2019s diverse political regimes and seek practical opportunities to profit from other states without running ideological litmus tests. This sentiment was clearly articulated by Brazil\u2019s Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira, when he said that his country will \u201calways talk to everyone,\u201d regardless of ideological orientation, under its universalist diplomatic doctrine.73\n\nFor much of the non-Western world, the West\u2019s rhetorical support for democracy has too often appeared hypocritical given long-standing U.S. and European backing for dictatorships. The picture is complicated by the fact that most of the democracies among the emerging powers\u2014Argentina, Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria, and South Africa\u2014have at some point been under autocratic regimes that were supported by the United States. It is not that they universally dislike democracy promotion, but that they see the West\u2019s pursuit of it as self-interested to the point of being disingenuous. To many of them, the United States promotes democracy selectively to punish rivals and pay lip service to liberal ideals, or as an instrument in its geopolitical struggle for influence with its rivals. This means that U.S. arguments framed in terms of democratic values carry less weight than policymakers in Washington sometimes assume (even if many foreign policy experts know this).74\n\nPotential Changes in Government and Leadership\n\nTo varying degrees, the foreign policy of each of the ten emerging powers could change if their leadership changes. For instance, the power transition that has taken place in Argentina has so far seen Milei vow to dollarize the economy, downgrade ties with China and Russia, and pull out of joining the BRICS\u2014all a far cry from his predecessor\u2019s approach. In T\u00fcrkiye, observers expected opposition leader Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu to adopt a more pro-West foreign policy if he won the 2023 presidential election.\n\nBut even in these countries where a change of leadership might have consequences, ties with China or Russia would likely remain fairly strong and domestic pressure could thwart an attempt to change course. For example, former president Jair Bolsonaro struggled to turn Brazil against China due to pressure from the agribusiness lobby.75 In Argentina, Milei may struggle to implement his more radical policies, and many of the business community\u2019s ties with China will endure.76 Since taking office, Milei has softened his rhetoric toward Beijing and made it clear that the private sector should not feel constrained in its dealings with China.77 For many of the emerging powers, their ties with China will have staying power from one government to the next.\n\nOther countries, such as India, Indonesia, and South Africa, have deep-rooted traditions of nonalignment and hedging that are unlikely to change with a change in government. Indonesia has adhered to an \u201cindependent and active foreign policy\u201d doctrine since its independence in 1945, essentially precluding it from aligning itself with any great power.78 South Africa\u2019s African National Congress, the party that has governed the country since 1994, is also committed to nonalignment.79 Though it faces a competitive election in 2024, observers still expect it to stay in power,80 but should it lose, any new government would find it hard to ditch its approach, given the public\u2019s strong support for nonalignment.81\n\nThe Limits of U.S. Influence\n\nThis chapter suggests that the United States\u2019 ability to shape the ten emerging powers\u2019 alignments is limited and varies across issues and countries. U.S. policymakers therefore need to assess whether it is worthwhile to invest time and diplomatic and economic resources into bringing any of these countries\u2019 policies more into alignment with Washington\u2019s.\n\nIt may be possible to tilt a few of the emerging powers away from Russia, and some may even move away from it over time with the realization that it has less to offer them than it claims. The United States might be able to gradually induce Argentina, Mexico, and Nigeria to adopt positions more in line with its own, but the question is whether this would be worth the effort given that the impact of doing so would be limited. A new generation of leaders whose worldview is not heavily shaped by the Cold War could also dampen the emerging powers\u2019 enthusiasm for ties to Moscow. If Russia used a nuclear weapon in Ukraine, this would likely also lead at least some of them to cut off relations.\n\nBut it will be difficult for the United States to meaningfully alter the positions of many of the emerging powers on Russia. Brazil, India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, and South Africa are likely to continue to maintain an open diplomatic posture toward Moscow. T\u00fcrkiye is the most closely aligned with the United States on Ukraine and the only emerging power to have provided the latter with weapons early on. T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s responsiveness to the U.S. request that it prevent transshipments of military goods to Russia suggests that U.S. overtures can make a difference in Ankara. But Erdo\u011fan has a long-standing pragmatic relationship with Putin that he is unlikely to abandon, and he is almost certain to respond negatively to U.S. efforts to twist his arm.\n\nThere are also limits to what the United States can achieve in influencing the emerging powers\u2019 positions on China. India is the power most closely aligned with the U.S. approach to China, but this should not be mistaken for Washington having outsized influence over New Delhi\u2019s future policy. India is aligned on China not because it wants to please the United States but because it sees a common strategic interest. India\u2019s security cooperation with the United States results almost entirely from its desire to strengthen its defenses against China.82 If Washington tried to push New Delhi to go further in countering China, such as by providing support in a Taiwan contingency, it would almost certainly fail. India will not allow its national interests to be defined, or even significantly influenced, by great powers like the United States.\n\nMeanwhile, Brazil, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, and South Africa seem set on deepening their relations with China and are likewise determined not to allow the United States to dictate the nature of these. For example, Washington failed to get these countries to restrict the use of Huawei equipment in their 5G networks. \u201cWe are not afraid of the big bad wolf,\u201d Lula\u2019s chief adviser said when asked about the United States\u2019 opposition to Brazil\u2019s technological cooperation with China.83 Indonesia\u2019s geographical and economic imperatives make a significant shift in its approach to China very unlikely. Saudi Arabia under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman will not eschew opportunities to cooperate with China. As already noted, changes in government could alter these positions to some degree in certain countries, yet the record suggests that these changes may not have a dramatic effect.\n\nThere may be more possibility for the United States to prevent Mexico from pursuing closer ties to China, but even there the picture is complex. There is little question that the United States is more important than China to Mexico\u2019s future. But as the United States considers nearshoring supply chains from China to Mexico, Chinese firms too are poised to invest heavily there, which could increase Beijing\u2019s influence.84\n\nOn narrow issues, the United States does have some capacity to shape the positions of the emerging powers. It often gets a positive response when it expresses compelling security concerns about a country\u2019s relationship with China. For example, Argentina envisaged allowing China to build a naval base in Ushuaia in 2022 but is now reconsidering the project after Washington expressed its concerns. Thailand regularly conducts military exercises with China, but it has an agreement with the United States not to use its F-16 or F-5 fighters in the exercises due to U.S. concerns about intelligence collection by China.85\n\nOn the whole, the United States\u2019 capacity to directly influence the alignments of the ten emerging powers is limited. That is why it needs a different approach.\n\nNotes\n\n1 Constanza Valdes, \u201cBrazil\u2019s Momentum as a Global Agricultural Supplier Faces Headwinds,\u201d U.S. Department of Agriculture, September 27, 2022, https://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2022/september/brazil-s-momentum-as-a-global-agricultural-supplier-faces-headwinds.\n\n2 Channing Ardnt et al., \u201cThe Ukraine War and Rising Commodity Prices: Implications for Developing Countries,\u201d Global Food Security 36, March 2023, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10015268; and Justine-Damien Gu\u00e9nette, Philip Kenworthy, and Collete Wheeler, \u201cImplications of the War in Ukraine for the Global Economy,\u201d World Bank Group, April 2022, https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/5d903e848db1d1b83e0ec8f744e55570-0350012021/related/Implications-of-the-War-in-Ukraine-for-the-Global-Economy.pdf.\n\n3 Lucian Magalhaes and Samantha Pearson, \u201cUkraine War Hits Farmers as Russia Cuts Fertilizer Supplies, Hurting Brazil,\u201d Wall Street Journal, March 5, 2022, https://www.wsj.com/articles/ukraine-war-hits-worlds-farmers-as-russia-cuts-fertilizer-supplies-hurting-brazil-11646487815; and Carla Bridi and Aamer Madhani, \u201cBrazil\u2019s Welcome of Russian Minister Prompts US Blowback,\u201d Associated Press, April 17, 2023, https://apnews.com/article/brazil-russia-lula-lavrov-putin-42c7c46fa629d98b2029aa1ff44a89b6.\n\n4 Jose Ara\u00fajo, \u201cBrazil Feeds Some 10% of World\u2019s Population, Research Finds,\u201d Reuters, March 4, 2021, https://www.reuters.com/article/brazil-grains/brazil-feeds-some-10-of-worlds-population-research-finds-idUSL2N2L23F6.\n\n5 Kali Robinson, \u201cRussia Killed the Black Sea Grain Deal.

        "text": "Biden could be left off Ohio ballot in November, state election office says\nPresident Joe Biden could be left off the ballot in Ohio in November, unless the GOP-led state legislature makes an exception to Ohio's ballot deadline or the Democratic Party moves up its nominating convention, according to the Ohio secretary of state's office.\n\nOhio set a deadline of Aug. 7 to certify presidential candidates for the general election, almost two weeks before the Democratic National Convention, where Mr. Biden is expected to be formally nominated by his party to run against presumptive GOP nominee former President Donald Trump. It is unlikely that the party would shift the date of the convention.\n\nIn a letter to state Democratic Party Chair Liz Walters last week, Paul DiSantis, the chief legal counsel for GOP Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, said Ohio law requires that presidential candidates be certified 90 days before this year's general election, which takes place on Nov. 5.\n\n\"The Democratic National Convention is scheduled to convene on August 19, 2024, which occurs more than a week after the August 7 deadline to certify a presidential candidate to this office,\" DiSantis wrote. \"Therefore, pending further clarification, I am left to conclude that the Democratic National Committee must either move up its nominating convention or the Ohio General Assembly must act by May 9, 2024 (90 days prior to a new law's effective date) to create an exception to this statutory requirement.\"\n\n\"Please contact me as soon as possible with any information that can assure this office of timely compliance with Ohio law,\" DiSantis wrote.\n\nThe Biden campaign said over the weekend that it does not expect the statute to keep the president off the ballot.\n\n\"We're monitoring the situation in Ohio, and we're confident that Joe Biden will be on the ballot in all 50 states,\" the campaign said in a statement.\n\nA similar situation occurred before the 2020 presidential election, too. Both the Republican and Democratic conventions were scheduled outside the deadline window, so Ohio lawmakers approved changing the cutoff to 60 days \u2014 but only for that election.\n\nThe Ohio Democratic Party confirmed it has received the letter and is reviewing it.\n\nTrump won Ohio in 2016 and also in 2020, when he lost to Mr. Biden, becoming the first losing presidential candidate Ohio had supported since it sided with Richard Nixon over John F. Kennedy in 1960.\n\nAaron Navarro contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Beyond Biden vs Trump: The other US elections that matter\nMany Australians are following the rematch in the 2024 US presidential election between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Trump's reality TV approach to politics makes it hard to avert one's eyes, with onlookers concerned about the consequences for Australia. But regardless of whether Trump or Biden wins the presidency, the party that controls the US Congress will influence foreign policy. The president may lead, but Congress can impede.\n\nUnder the US Constitution, Congress has considerable authority to push back against a president, which typically happens when a rival party controls a chamber.\n\nParties in the US Congress have razor-thin margins separating them, and the elections could give either of them power with just a small shift of seats. The Democrats control the Senate 51\u201349. In the House, Republicans control the 435-seat chamber by just two seats. With the country so polarised, it is doubtful there will be a sizable swing in seats that would give either party a mandate. But all it takes for power to shift is a few thousand votes in some states and districts.\n\nHere is why those votes will matter. Under the US Constitution, Congress has considerable authority to push back against a president, which typically happens when a rival party controls a chamber. For Australia, the US Senate will be especially important given its role in foreign policy debates, including presidential appointments like the Secretary of State and approval of treaties (last year, Congress passed legislation that prohibits any president from withdrawing from NATO without the approval of two-thirds of the US Senate). The US House weighs in heavily on defence spending, foreign aid and trade agreements. Many decisions by these chambers have implications for US allies. If Republicans run the table and win control of the White House and both chambers of Congress, radical policy change affecting Australia is still unlikely, but it is bound to introduce uncertainty in US foreign affairs, which has its own implications.\n\nUS President Joe Biden (C) delivers remarks on the AUKUS partnership with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese (L) and UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak (R), 13 March 2023 (Adam Schultz/White House/Flickr)\n\nWhat about AUKUS? Australians have committed themselves to a big financial and geopolitical investment with the trilateral partnership. Will the US Congress hold up its end of the bargain under new leadership? While any international deal holds risks, I think so. There appears to be more bipartisan consensus about security perils in the Pacific compared to Europe\u2019s threat from Russia. Trump has no special animus towards Australia (like he does Europe), and while he\u2019s not very strategic, he is transactional. This deal appears to benefit US domestic workers and the defence industry. Trump will get pushback from Congress if he tries to renege, especially if the Democrats have control. Republicans will push back too, if the replacement for the retiring Republican leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, is from the same hawkish wing of the party. Keep in mind that the National Defense Authorization Act, which approved AUKUS, passed with significant bipartisan support except for the ideological fringes of both parties. The centre still holds on foreign policy in Congress.\n\nThe Democrats have a decent shot at re-taking the US House, even if Trump wins. But bets are off if Trump expands his lead over Biden as the election nears.\n\nSo, who is likely to win control of these chambers? They are as hard to predict as the presidency. The Republicans probably have an advantage in the Senate because the Democrats are trying to protect more incumbents in highly competitive states. And three states are complete toss-ups: rust-belt Ohio, mountain-rural Montana, and western-sunbelt Arizona. All three Republican candidates have earned the MAGA label from Trump \u2014 meaning they support his brand of America First, election-denying populism. In two of those states, Ohio and Montana, the Democratic incumbents have defied gravity in previous elections by winning in states dominated by Republican voters. It is far from clear they can pull that off again.\n\nOver in the House, it is a somewhat different story with Democrats feeling like they have a decent shot of taking control. The seat margin favouring House Republicans gets smaller with each retirement of a disillusioned moderate Republican. Democrats and Republicans are defending roughly an equal number of toss-up seats, about ten each. Keep your eyes on California and New York. The good news for Democrats is that many toss-ups occupied by Republicans are in these two blue states with \"crossover\" districts (which vote for president of one party and House for the other). In an era of party polarisation, crossover districts are a vanishing breed. And Democrats certainly hope so in these districts, which will be lavished with millions in campaign funds to sway a few thousand, or maybe a few hundred, voters.\n\nHouse Democrats are typically at a disadvantage because of how local districts get drawn, and this election will be no different. But the House Republicans appear to be knee-capping themselves, looking like the chaos party with a radical faction, called the Freedom Caucus, pushing to depose its leaders, block funding for Ukraine, and shut down the government by refusing to approve budgets. The current Speaker, an evangelical Republican from Louisiana, is inexperienced and holding on by his fingernails. While gerrymandered districts give a slight edge to Republicans, if the party allows its most conservative factions to push hard on issues like abortion they will suffer in the suburban districts with moderate women voters.\n\nSo, the Democrats have a decent shot at re-taking the House, even if Trump wins. But bets are off if Trump expands his lead over Biden as the election nears, which would indicate a surge in Republican voters. I don't expect that to happen. The election is likely to be a nail-biter with an evenly divided electorate staying loyal to their party, even if they don't like the candidates. And in a close election for control of each office \u2014 president, Senate, and House \u2014 there are good odds of a divided government, which means the United States may drift but won't fundamentally change its relationships with allies like Australia. That may be the best news to offer during a time of rancorous disunity in the United States.",

        "text": "AI-fuelled election campaigns are here \u2014 where are the rules?\nOf the nearly two billion people living in countries that are holding elections this year, some have already cast their ballots. Elections held in Indonesia and Pakistan in February, among other countries, offer an early glimpse of what\u2019s in store as artificial intelligence (AI) technologies steadily intrude into the electoral arena. The emerging picture is deeply worrying, and the concerns are much broader than just misinformation or the proliferation of fake news.\n\nAs the former director of the Machine Learning, Ethics, Transparency and Accountability (META) team at Twitter (before it became X), I can attest to the massive ongoing efforts to identify and halt election-related disinformation enabled by generative AI (GAI). But uses of AI by politicians and political parties for purposes that are not overtly malicious also raise deep ethical concerns.\n\nGAI is ushering in an era of \u2018softfakes\u2019. These are images, videos or audio clips that are doctored to make a political candidate seem more appealing. Whereas deepfakes (digitally altered visual media) and cheap fakes (low-quality altered media) are associated with malicious actors, softfakes are often made by the candidate\u2019s campaign team itself.\n\nHow to stop AI deepfakes from sinking society \u2014 and science\n\nIn Indonesia\u2019s presidential election, for example, winning candidate Prabowo Subianto relied heavily on GAI, creating and promoting cartoonish avatars to rebrand himself as gemoy, which means \u2018cute and cuddly\u2019. This AI-powered makeover was part of a broader attempt to appeal to younger voters and displace allegations linking him to human-rights abuses during his stint as a high-ranking army officer. The BBC dubbed him \u201cIndonesia\u2019s \u2018cuddly grandpa\u2019 with a bloody past\u201d. Furthermore, clever use of deepfakes, including an AI \u2018get out the vote\u2019 virtual resurrection of Indonesia\u2019s deceased former president Suharto by a group backing Subianto, is thought by some to have contributed to his surprising win.\n\nNighat Dad, the founder of the research and advocacy organization Digital Rights Foundation, based in Lahore, Pakistan, documented how candidates in Bangladesh and Pakistan used GAI in their campaigns, including AI-written articles penned under the candidate\u2019s name. South and southeast Asian elections have been flooded with deepfake videos of candidates speaking in numerous languages, singing nostalgic songs and more \u2014 humanizing them in a way that the candidates themselves couldn\u2019t do in reality.\n\nWhat should be done? Global guidelines might be considered around the appropriate use of GAI in elections, but what should they be? There have already been some attempts. The US Federal Communications Commission, for instance, banned the use of AI-generated voices in phone calls, known as robocalls. Businesses such as Meta have launched watermarks \u2014 a label or embedded code added to an image or video \u2014 to flag manipulated media.\n\nBut these are blunt and often voluntary measures. Rules need to be put in place all along the communications pipeline \u2014 from the companies that generate AI content to the social-media platforms that distribute them.\n\nWhat the EU\u2019s tough AI law means for research and ChatGPT\n\nContent-generation companies should take a closer look at defining how watermarks should be used. Watermarking can be as obvious as a stamp, or as complex as embedded metadata to be picked up by content distributors.\n\nCompanies that distribute content should put in place systems and resources to monitor not just misinformation, but also election-destabilizing softfakes that are released through official, candidate-endorsed channels. When candidates don\u2019t adhere to watermarking \u2014 none of these practices are yet mandatory \u2014 social-media companies can flag and provide appropriate alerts to viewers. Media outlets can and should have clear policies on softfakes. They might, for example, allow a deepfake in which a victory speech is translated to multiple languages, but disallow deepfakes of deceased politicians supporting candidates.\n\nElection regulatory and government bodies should closely examine the rise of companies that are engaging in the development of fake media. Text-to-speech and voice-emulation software from Eleven Labs, an AI company based in New York City, was deployed to generate robocalls that tried to dissuade voters from voting for US President Joe Biden in the New Hampshire primary elections in January, and to create the softfakes of former Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan during his 2024 campaign outreach from a prison cell. Rather than pass softfake regulation on companies, which could stifle allowable uses such as parody, I instead suggest establishing election standards on GAI use. There is a long history of laws that limit when, how and where candidates can campaign, and what they are allowed to say.\n\nCitizens have a part to play as well. We all know that you cannot trust what you read on the Internet. Now, we must develop the reflexes to not only spot altered media, but also to avoid the emotional urge to think that candidates\u2019 softfakes are \u2018funny\u2019 or \u2018cute\u2019. The intent of these isn\u2019t to lie to you \u2014 they are often obviously AI generated. The goal is to make the candidate likeable.\n\nSoftfakes are already swaying elections in some of the largest democracies in the world. We would be wise to learn and adapt as the ongoing year of democracy, with some 70 elections, unfolds over the next few months.",

Well, that answer's no. Do I believe we're going to get better? I believe in that. I'm an optimistic guy, and I believe we can get better.\"\n\nThe actor said his endorsement, which was the first time he had ever publicly supported a presidential candidate, was the \"best decision for me at that time\".\n\n\"Am I going to do that again this year? That answer's no. I'm not going to do that,\" he said.\n\nHe told Fox News he believed it \"caused an incredible amount of, division in our country\", which he said \"tears me up in my guts back then and now\".\n\nThis time, he said, his \"goal is to bring our country together\".\n\n\"I believe in that, in my DNA,\" he added. \"So in the spirit of that, there's going to be no endorsement.\"\n\nHe said that given his level of influence, \"I'm going to keep my politics to myself\".\n\nHe added: \"I will tell you this, like a lot of us out there, not trusting of all politicians, I do trust the American people and I trust that whoever they vote for... that is my president who I will support 100%.\"\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 3:01 Biden takes aim at Trump\n\nWhat did Johnson say about cancel culture?\n\nAsked what was important to him, he said: \"To be real and to be direct and to be open and to be transparent\u2026 that's important to me.\n\n\"In today's easy cancel culture world and cancel culture, woke culture, this culture, that culture, division, etc, that really bugs me.\"\n\n\"In the spirit of that, you either succumb and be what you think other people want you to be or you go: 'Well no, that's not who I am, I'm going to be myself and I'm going to be real'\u2026 and that may get people upset, it may piss people off, and that's okay.\n\n\"But it took me some time to recognise that.\"\n\nJohnson said he didn't realise the power of fame until he \"got down the road a little bit\".\n\nHe said he later realised fame is \"a superpower when used correctly... when you can use it to influence people\", adding it could be used to make people more \"direct\" and \"honest\".\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:47 'Biden the worst president in US history'\n\nWhy is Johnson being criticised?\n\nMany on social media have accused Johnson of playing it too safe for the sake of his public image and wide appeal.\n\nOthers have said he could have simply stayed quiet on the matter, rather than announcing he would not be publicly supporting Mr Biden again.\n\nRead more:\n\nControversial Dwayne Johnson waxwork unveiled\n\nThe Rock's 'historic' charity donation\n\nSome have suggested his comments are an indirect endorsement of Donald Trump, claiming Johnson's lack of support for Mr Biden benefits Republicans more than Democrats.\n\nJohnson's comments were booed by the studio audience on chat show The View after a clip of the Fox interview was played.\n\nSky News has contacted Johnson's representatives for comment.\n\nFollow Sky News on WhatsApp Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky News Tap here\n\nWhat did Johnson say in 2020?\n\nThe actor interviewed Mr Biden and then running mate Kamala Harris ahead of what he called \"arguably the most critical election our country has seen in decades\".\n\nIn a video shared on his social media accounts, Johnson told his followers that endorsing a candidate \"is something that I've certainly not done in the past, so I'm going to go big - you guys know me, if I go, I go big!\"\n\n\"As a registered independent for years now with centrist ideologies, I do feel that vice president Biden and senator Harris are the best choice to lead our country and I am endorsing them to become president and vice president of our United States,\" he said at the time.\n\nJohnson talked about political careers of Mr Biden and Ms Harris and said her experience proved she is \"smart\" and \"tough\" and a \"certified badass\".\n\nThe Rock, who said he had voted for both parties in the past, also criticised Donald Trump in 2021, suggesting the then-president was absent in the aftermath of George Floyd's murder.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:41 Johnson hits out at Donald Trump in aftermath of George Floyd's death\n\nCould The Rock still run for president himself?\n\nJohnson has long touted the idea of becoming the US president himself, previously saying he would \"consider a presidential run in the future if that's what the people wanted\".\n\nHe first made the suggestion in 2017, telling GQ it was \"a real possibility\" and later revealed he had even considered running in the 2020 election.\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free\n\nLate last year, he said more than one political party had asked him if he was interested in running at the end of 2022.\n\nAsked in his latest interview if he still intended to run, Johnson told Fox News: \"As of now - no, that's not my intention\u2026 I'm not a politician.

        "text": "Arizona pushes abortion to centre stage before US election\nArizona pushes abortion to centre stage before US election\n\nGetty Images Donald Trump has said Arizona's Supreme Court went \"too far\" by paving the way for a near-total ban on abortions in the state.\n\nThe Arizona Supreme Court on Tuesday pushed the abortion issue to centre stage in a state that could be pivotal in deciding who wins November's US presidential election.\n\nIt has prompted Democrats to go on the attack, and set many Republicans scrambling to align themselves more closely with the public sentiment.\n\nThe court paved the way for a near-total ban on abortion, a law passed in 1864 when Arizona was still a US territory, to go into effect in the coming weeks if there is no further legal action. The law had been pre-empted for nearly a half-century, as a result of the 1973 US Supreme Court ruling in Roe v Wade that guaranteed a woman's right to abortion.\n\nTwo years ago, however, the US Supreme Court overturned that abortion precedent. This gave old bans like the one in Arizona - which became a state in 1912 - new life.\n\nThe Arizona court decision prompted quick condemnation from the Biden administration as well as from local Democrats and pro-choice activists.\n\n\"This ruling is a result of the extreme agenda of Republican elected officials who are committed to ripping away women's freedom,\" the president said in a statement provided by the White House.\n\nWhile anti-abortion groups heralded the decision, many Republicans have distanced themselves from the state court action, reflecting polls that suggest a majority of the public - in the US and in Arizona - favour abortion rights and oppose strict bans on the procedure.\n\nThe party had largely opposed abortion before Roe was overturned, but is now grappling with the fallout from that decision. Kari Lake, the presumptive Republican nominee for an open Arizona Senate seat, provided a vivid illustration of the challenges and contradictions the abortion issue is presenting for conservative candidates.\n\nIn a statement released on Tuesday, the former television news presenter condemned the court ruling and said that the 1864 law, which she had previously supported, was \"out of step with Arizonans\". She said Arizona voters would have the chance to decide the abortion issue in the forthcoming ballot referendum - although she has said she is against its passage.\n\nShe called on the Democrat who beat her in 2022, Governor Katie Hobbs, to work with the Republican-controlled legislature to find a \"common sense\" solution - without spelling out what that would entail.\n\nOn Monday, former President Donald Trump released a short video detailing his own shifting position, which included leaving the ultimate decision on legality to individual states. It was a message that Ms Lake echoed.\n\n\"I wholeheartedly agree with President Trump,\" she said. \"This is a very personal issue that should be determined by each individual state and her people.\"\n\nBy Wednesday, Mr Trump himself had weighed in on the Arizona ruling, saying it had gone \"too far\".\n\nWhile the Arizona Supreme Court left the door open to further legal challenges, if the 1864 ban goes into effect it could provide a stark illustration for voters of what individual states determining abortion policy can look like.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the Florida Supreme Court ruled that the state's six-week abortion ban could go into effect. This has fuelled speculation the issue could make the large state, which has trended toward Republican of late, a key presidential battleground.\n\nNow there's a new ground zero in the national abortion fight.\n\nArizona is already an electoral battleground. Joe Biden was the first Democrat in 24 years to win the state, with its 11 electoral votes, by a margin of about 10,000 votes. If he can repeat the feat there, it gives the president a path to victory even if he drops other closely contested states he won four years ago, like Wisconsin, Nevada and Georgia.\n\nThe state's Senate race, between Ms Lake and Democrat Ruben Gallego, will also help determine which party controls the upper chamber of Congress.\n\nWith the abortion-rights referendum expected to appear on the November ballot, Democrats were already hoping the issue would help drive turnout from voters more inclined to support Mr Biden and the rest of the party's slate of candidates.\n\nSimilar abortion-rights measures have passed in every state that has put them to a vote, including Republican-dominated states like Kansas, Kentucky and Ohio. Democrats have campaigned aggressively on the abortion issue, and the connection is widely considered to have helped the party post better-than-expected results in the 2022 midterm congressional elections.\n\nIn a March Fox News poll, 39% of Arizona voters said abortion would be \"extremely important\" in determining the presidential candidate they would support in November, and that those voters were much more likely to back Mr Biden.\n\nWith the state court's decision, the stakes have only been raised. November's ballot measure could determine whether Arizona enshrines abortion rights in its constitution, or has a virtual ban on the procedure.",

        "text": "Union Petitions Up 35%, Unfair Labor Practices Charge Filings Up 7% in the First Half of Fiscal Year 2024\nDuring the first six months of Fiscal Year 2024 (October 1\u2013March 31), union election petitions filed at NLRB field offices rose 35% over the same period in Fiscal Year 2023. Notably, this is driven by a spike in employer-filed RM-petitions, after the Board\u2019s Cemex decision, accompanied by an uptick in employee-filed RC-petitions. In total, 1,618 petitions were filed during this time, compared with 1,199 in the first half of Fiscal Year 2023. Of the recent petitions, 1,137 were RC-petitions and 281 were RM-petitions.\n\nAt the same time, unfair labor practice (ULP) charges filed across the NLRB\u2019s field offices have increased 7%\u2014from 9,612 to 10,278. Accounting for union petitions and unfair labor practice charges, the NLRB received 11,896 cases in the first half of Fiscal Year 2024, up 10% over the first half of Fiscal Year 2023 when the field offices received 10,811 cases.\n\nThis increase in filings continues the surge in NLRB caseload in recent years. In Fiscal Year 2023, ULP charges were up 10% and election petitions were up 3% over the previous year. In Fiscal Year 2022, union petitions were up 53% and ULP charges filed increased 19% over Fiscal Year 2021.\n\nThe surge in caseload occurs as the Agency struggles with funding and staffing shortages. Last month, Congress flat-funded the NLRB at $299.2 million at a time when more resources are desperately needed. Last year, Congress gave the NLRB a $25 million increase, which ended a hiring freeze, prevented furloughs, and allowed the NLRB to backfill some critical staff vacancies. However, the Agency remains understaffed after flat funding in nine of the past 10 years. In the past two decades, staffing in field offices has shrunk by 50%.\n\n\u201cAs the NLRB\u2019s case intake reflects a critical moment in our nation\u2019s history, I\u2019m proud of NLRB Field and Headquarters staff for processing cases with professionalism and care,\u201d said NLRB General Counsel Jennifer Abruzzo. \u201cHowever, Congress needs to fully fund the NLRB to effectively and efficiently comply with our Congressional mandate when providing quality service to the public in conducting hearings and elections, investigating charges, settling and litigating meritorious cases, and obtaining full and prompt remedies for workers whose rights are violated.\u201d",

        "text": "A Shift in Power: CHP Win Ushers in Recalibration in Turkish Politics\nThe Turkish local elections on March 31 were a real game-changer. The Justice and Development Party (AKP), led by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, did not put up a credible challenge to Republican People's Party (CHP) candidates in cities like Istanbul and Ankara and came second in total overall votes. The CHP not only came first\u2014a feat not achieved since the 1977 general elections\u2014but also secured a victory in almost all major cities in Turkey, including a province it had not won since 1946. Overall, the elections brought fresh energy to the opposition, positioning Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu at the center of Turkish politics.\n\nIn stark contrast to the pervasive disillusionment that characterized last year's May 14 presidential elections\u2014where a profound sense of apathy, particularly among the youth, prevailed\u2014 the local elections somewhat mitigated that wave of despair for the moment.\n\nElection night\n\nIt was a surprising night for many. The CHP won in 36 out of Turkey's 81 municipalities, making significant inroads into many of Erdogan's strongholds. It garnered 38% of the national vote, slightly edging out the president's party at 35%, marking the CHP's most substantial electoral triumph since Erdogan's ascent to power over two decades ago.\n\nTurkey's recent economic troubles played a big part, tipping the scales in favor of the opposition.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to this political shift. Turkey's recent economic troubles played a big part, tipping the scales in favor of the opposition. The country has been wrestling with serious financial issues since 2018, such as skyrocketing inflation and a lack of foreign currency reserves. These problems, in addition to the Erdogan government\u2019s austerity measures, have hit the wallets of ordinary people hard and sparked a lot of frustration with the government's approach to the economy.\n\nThe opposition jumped on this dissatisfaction. They criticized Erdogan's handling of the economy and promised to bring more transparency and effectiveness to public spending and local governance. Istanbul's Imamoglu had been implementing several policies, such as establishing restaurants that provide cheap yet quality food, distributing subsidized milk to school children, and providing free public transportation for mothers with children under 4 to bring relief to those battered by the harsh economic conditions.\n\nAs for the CHP, the overhaul in its leadership in November was pivotal. The election of new CHP leader Ozgur Ozel, alongside the opposition's key figure Ekrem Imamoglu and their respective teams, infused a fresh dynamism and direction, resonating deeply with voters.\n\nDespite the element of surprise for many, including observers from the international community, the mood at CHP headquarters on the evening of the election was distinctly upbeat. Nezih Onur Kuru, Director of the Research Department at the CHP Electoral Strategy Office, said, \"The CHP undertook thorough preparations for this election, devising a strategy anchored in solid data gathered from various districts throughout Turkey.\" In Istanbul, according to Kuru, the collaboration with the DEM Party via an informal coalition was instrumental in amplifying Imamoglu's vote tally while simultaneously securing additional seats for the CHP in the municipal council.\n\nIn essence, Kuru emphasized that the election outcomes were anticipated by those within the CHP headquarters, given the continuous polling throughout the campaign period. The new leadership underscored the CHP's commitment to transformation and readiness to govern, culminating in a significant triumph. However, the CHP wasn't the only winner of the election night.\n\nNew party prospects\n\nThe rise of the New Welfare Party (YRP), a new, far-right Islamist party, significantly impacted the elections by attracting disillusioned AKP supporters unhappy with the government's economic policies as well as Turkey's ongoing trade with Israel. The YRP's emergence as a formidable force, despite significant pressure from Erdogan to align with AKP, effectively siphoned a substantial portion of votes away from AKP.\n\nThe Peoples' Equality and Democracy Party (DEM Party), successor to the pro-Kurdish People\u2019s Democratic Party (HDP), successfully reversed its declining voter support since the 2015 elections. This success contrasts with the failure of the AKP-led governance, which relied on trustee-based politics. Despite attempts to criminalize the DEM Party, Kurdish opposition remains vibrant. The DEM Party's performance in local elections, winning in 12 municipalities and increasing votes in others, demonstrates dissatisfaction with trustee politics among Kurds.\n\nA significant portion of the supporters of the ruling AKP-MHP coalition did not vote, likely in protest. Despite increasing voter registration, the same amount of people voted as in previous elections, indicating a lack of enthusiasm for this round. The decrease in turnout suggests potential dissatisfaction among AKP voters, primarily attributed to ongoing economic and political crises.\n\nFor Erdogan, the elections spelled a stark reversal of fortune, marking the first time AKP fell to the second spot since its foundation. This outcome is a significant blow to the AKP's image, relegating it to Turkey's second party.\n\nThe Imamoglu effect\n\nIstanbul and its districts were particularly significant in this election. The acquisition of the city council by the CHP will remove obstacles for Ekrem Imamoglu, paving the way for new projects and potentially more effective governance compared to the previous five years, wherein AKP councilmembers blocked numerous policies such as the procurement of new taxis for the city.\n\nSince a significant portion (26 out of 39) of Istanbul's districts are now under CHP control, impactful projects in the metropolitan area have become feasible. The economic challenges highlight how crucial local governance is, especially since local authorities are key in delivering basic services and fostering economic opportunities.\n\nThe long-term effects of the elections on the political landscape are yet to unfold, yet it seems tougher days are ahead for Erdogan and his AKP. Imamoglu, having secured a decisive win and maintained his position in the recent mayoral elections, now stands as a likely contender for the presidency in the future, despite Erdogan's vigorous campaign efforts for the AKP. The president's attempt to win back Turkey's largest city was marked by significant attention from state-aligned media towards the AKP's candidate, Murat Kurum, and efforts from top ministers to engage Istanbul's populace directly.\n\nImamoglu's victory marks a significant shift. According to Kemal Buyukyuksel, Senior Analyst at the CHP Electoral Strategy Office, Imamoglu's success, in addition to his popular policies in Istanbul, stems from his ability to extend the social democratic CHP's appeal beyond its typical base of support (usually 25% of voters), attracting conservative and Kurdish voters alike. Buyukyuksel attributes this success to Imamoglu's focus on impactful policies over grand projects aimed at public relations, as well as his unifying personality.\n\nThe Turkish local elections will usher in a period of political recalibration in Turkey, with the next presidential election four years down the road.\n\nThe Turkish local elections will usher in a period of political recalibration in Turkey, with the next presidential election four years down the road. This shift will prompt the global community to reevaluate its stance towards Turkey in light of emerging leaders and evolving political landscapes. The opposition's significant win provides a boost of morale, hope, and encouragement, particularly for those worried about the erosion of democratic principles in the nation. For Erdogan, the challenge ahead lies in tackling an economy that desperately requires intervention, presenting a steep climb.\n\nThe views expressed in these articles are those of the author and do not reflect an official position of the Wilson Center.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Timeline: Haiti\u2019s history and current crisis, explained\n1492: The \u201cBeginning\u201d of History\n\nChristopher Columbus lands on what is now known as Hispaniola (the island shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic) and claims it for Spanish monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella. While this has been regarded as the beginning of Haiti\u2019s written history, the island had been inhabited by indigenous Ta\u00edno (who referred to the land as Ayiti) since the BC era and had a rich history long before Spanish conquest.\n\nAn engraving by Theodor de Bry of Christopher Columbus landing on Hispaniola on Dec. 6, 1492. (Image: Library of Congress)\n\n1496-1697: Spanish Colonization\n\nIn 1496, the first Spanish settlement on Hispaniola (and the first European settlement in the western hemisphere) is established in what is now present-day Dominican Republic. Five years later, after all but decimating the population of Ta\u00edno people, Spain brings 1,600 kidnapped and enslaved African people to the island to work in gold mines and on sugar plantations.\n\n1625-97: French Colonization\n\nThe first French settlers establish a colony on Tortuga Island and in the northwestern area of Haiti\u2019s mainland, naming the territory Saint-Domingue. In the latter part of the 17th Century, under Louis XIV, France authorizes African slave trade in the territory and introduces the Code Noir, which not further restricts the rights of enslaved people \u2014 as well as the rights of free people of color \u2014 in all French territories .\n\nIn 1697, Spain cedes its territory in western Hispaniola to France. Under French rule, Saint-Domingue is the country\u2019s richest colony in the 18th Century, producing half of all the sugar and coffee bought and sold in Europe and accounting for one-third of the Atlantic slave trade.\n\nAn engraving by Nicolace Ponce of Cap Fran\u00e7ais (present-day Cap-Ha\u00eftien), 1791. (Photo: New York Public Library Digital Collections)\n\n1789-1804: Revolution(s)\n\nThe 1789 French Revolution makes more people \u2014 on both sides of the Atlantic \u2014 outspoken for the rights of Black and indigenous people of color in the colony. France violently represses this activism, which leads to the beginning of the Haitian Revolution in 1791.\n\nThe Haitian Revolution continues for more than a decade, destroying much of Haiti\u2019s agricultural resources and infrastructure. On December 4, 1803, French forces surrender to Jean-Jacques Dessalines in the northwestern commune of Gona\u00efves. For the first time in over 300 years, Haiti is once again an independent nation.\n\n1804-20: A Fractured Peace and Civil War\n\nOn January 1, 1804, Dessalines assumes the role of Governor-General. He declares himself Emperor later that year, and is assassinated two years later. This leads to a Haitian civil war between the north and south that lasts until 1820. Reunification following the second peace excludes Black Haitians from power.\n\nHaiti's independence from France came at a cost: Reparations that cost the country approximately $20 billion that were paid through high-interest loans. The final payment was made in 1947.\n\n1825-1914: Independence, But At A Cost\n\nFrench King Charles X agrees to formally recognize Haiti as an independent nation, provided that the country pay 150 million francs in reparations to France (approximately $21 billion in today\u2019s currency, according to Forbes). Haiti takes out high-interest loans from American, German, and French banks to cover the cost (approximately 80% of the country\u2019s annual national budget and 10 times its annual revenue).\n\nIn 1838, France reduces this debt from 150 million to 90 million francs (ca. $12.6 billion). The final payment on the double-debt of Haiti's reparations to France and its loans from the United States is made in 1947, nearly 150 years after independence.\n\n1915-37: American Occupation and the Parsley Massacre\n\nAfter a series of border disputes with the Dominican Republic and short-lived presidencies culminating in the assassination of leader Jean Vilbrun Guillaume Sam, the United States invades Haiti in 1915 to protect its investments in-country. The United States withdraws its forces in 1934.\n\nThree years later, Dominican forces under the orders of President Rafael Trujillo kill an estimated 30,000 Haitians living in the border zone between the two countries in what\u2019s known today as the Parsley Massacre.\n\n1954-71: Fran\u00e7ois \u201cPapa Doc\u201d Duvalier Takes Power\n\nShortly after Haiti celebrates 150 years of independence, Hurricane Hazel makes landfall in the country in October 1954, killing 1,000 and destroying coffee and cocoa crops at the beginning of harvest season. In 1957, following two failed elections, physician Fran\u00e7ois \u201cPapa Doc\u201d Duvalier seizes power. His cult of personality turns despotic the following year when he establishes death squads to silence his opponents. In 1964, Duvalier declares himself president for life, a title he maintains until his death in 1971.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Duvalier during his 1957 presidential campaign (Photo: Wikimedia Commons / Public Domain)\n\n1971-86: The Reign and Fall of Jean-Claude \u201cBaby Doc\u201d Duvalier\n\nFollowing Duvalier\u2019s death, his 19-year-old son, Jean-Claude \u201cBaby Doc\u201d Duvalier, assumes the title of president for life. A popular revolt in 1986, however, leads to Baby Doc fleeing Haiti. He is replaced by Lieutenant-General Henri Namphy.\n\n1987-88: Leslie Manigat Elected and Overthrown\n\nThe elections of 1987 are delayed following the assassinations of two candidates and a massacre of Haitian voters. Military-run elections in January 1988 declare Leslie Manigat the winner. He is overthrown in a military coup led by Namphy six months later. In September, Namphy himself is overthrown by General Prosper Avril.",

        "text": "Emerging Powers and the Future of American Statecraft\nMuch existing thinking about the ten emerging powers\u2019 various alignments with China and Russia emphasizes the influence of economic interests. Economic interests do play an important role in shaping their desire to have positive relations with China and, in many cases, with Russia, but they are not the only factor that matters. The emerging powers\u2019 views of what constitutes a just international order, their geographies, their defense relationships, and, in some cases, their domestic politics also play a role. Chinese and Russian propaganda and disinformation also have some influence on them, although this should not be exaggerated. One factor that does not appear to drive the emerging powers is a concern about the state of democracy and human rights in other countries. Tables 4 and 5 summarize the analysis that follows.\n\nEconomic Interests\n\nEconomic interests play a key role in shaping the ten emerging powers\u2019 positions on China and Russia. As developing countries, they are less able to absorb the economic costs of international conflict. For many, their economies have been more vulnerable to the inflationary shock to food prices that the war in Ukraine caused. In addition, they see important future gains from economic cooperation with China and Russia, especially where that promises investment or technology. They also derive a large share of their GDP from exports, which can make them highly vulnerable to external economic disruptions. For example, Brazil\u2019s agricultural and food sector generates about one-third of its GDP, and Nigeria and Saudi Arabia are heavily dependent on oil exports.1 Their capacity to absorb shocks, such as the one that Europe underwent to end its reliance on Russian energy, is more limited than that of the developed economies of Asia and the West. All of this makes them disinclined to sacrifice economic ties with Russia or China.\n\nEconomic Relations With Russia\n\nWhen it came to Ukraine, economic interests were key factors that encouraged Brazil, India, T\u00fcrkiye, and Saudi Arabia to preserve ties to Russia. Some of the emerging powers were driven by the desire to maintain a specific economic relationship. Others were driven by a general concern about the economic impact of the war. And some were driven by economic opportunities created by the sanctions regime on Russia.\n\nBecause their economies are more fragile than, say, those of the G7 countries and are very much tied to the global economy, the emerging powers have less ability to absorb the economic effects of the war. They have faced disproportionate economic consequences, including high energy prices, food scarcity, and inflation.2\n\nBrazil\u2019s reliance on Russia for one-quarter of its fertilizer imports appears to have been a key factor that dissuaded it from backing the West\u2019s anti-Russia coalition.3 If Russia were to cut these exports, it would damage Brazil\u2019s agricultural output and harm its economy.4 Nigeria, Thailand, and Indonesia are heavily reliant on Russia and Ukraine for fertilizer and wheat and desperately want the war to end so that supply chains can be restored.5 Shipments of Russian wheat to Nigeria have dwindled to almost nothing as a consequence of the war, prompting a food security crisis.6 In Indonesia, the war led to shortages of Indomie instant noodles, raising the price of an affordable staple. When Jokowi visited Kyiv and Moscow in June 2022, Indonesians called it an \u201cIndomie mission\u201d\u2014a clear indication of how important food supply chain disruptions were to their country.7\n\nA few of their leaders blamed Western sanctions as much as they blamed Russia\u2019s invasion for this situation. South Africa\u2019s Ramaphosa, for example, warned in May 2022 that sanctions would lead \u201cbystander\u201d countries that are \u201cnot part of the conflict\u201d to suffer.8 Indeed, the global economic damage of the war is in part a consequence of Russia\u2019s threat to Ukraine\u2019s grain exports, but Western sanctions have played a part in intensifying the damage for many countries.9 Most of the emerging powers have seen their neighbors sanctioned by the United States. (T\u00fcrkiye itself has been sanctioned.) And they oppose such extraterritoriality, seeing the sanctions as a coercive violation of national sovereignty. Their decision not to join the sanctions regime on Russia is consistent with their long-standing opposition to sanctions in general, which is tied to their critiques of the structure of the current global order.10\n\nThe sanctions regime created economic opportunities for some of the emerging powers that they did not want to miss. For example, India\u2019s low per capita GDP and enormous demand for energy made it difficult to say no to the cheap energy Russia offered. As Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar put it, wealthy European countries were able to wean themselves from Russian oil imports in a way that was \u201ccomfortable,\u201d but \u201cI have a population at $2,000 [per capita annual income]. I also need energy, and I am not in a position to pay high prices for oil.\u201d11 Saudi Arabia similarly capitalized on the war by coordinating oil production cuts with OPEC+ and raking in extra profits.12 T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s initial increase in illicit exports to Russia can be put in the same category\u2014even though Ankara eventually tightened up controls.\n\nEconomic Relations With China\n\nEconomic interests loom no less large in the ten emerging powers\u2019 approaches to China, which uses its robust economic ties to increase its bargaining power with them as it does with other countries around the world.13\n\nEconomic ties are a key factor in the embrace of China by eight of these countries. In Argentina, Brazil, Indonesia, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Thailand, and T\u00fcrkiye, China has funded high-speed railways, seaports, 5G networks, nickel plants, renewable energy infrastructure, nuclear power plants, and more, mostly through the BRI. The economic and technological benefits they gain from China can make them hesitant to do anything that might antagonize Beijing, lest they lose out on future loans, investment, and trade. The United States has sought to draw attention to the problems that some countries have encountered with BRI financing, but this cannot counteract the benefits that emerging powers gain from it.14 China\u2019s claim that BRI-related growth has lifted 42 million people out of poverty is dubious, but it is clear that the initiative has expanded trade and connectivity, generated jobs, and enhanced development in most recipient countries.15\n\nEconomic ties have created pro-China constituencies in the emerging powers that are able to pressure the government to maintain positive relations with Beijing. For example, Brazil\u2019s agribusiness caucus pressures its government to deepen relations with China, its top importer.16 Such lobbies can constrain the range of action governments can take toward China without sacrificing domestic political support.\n\nChina also wields economic power through coercive measures, such as by threatening economic costs for nations that challenge its interests.17 The potential for such measures provides influence with the emerging powers, even though economic coercion can sometimes backfire.18 Most of the emerging powers have robust economic ties with the United States and thus seek a middle ground between the two powers. As discussed above, most of them receive more U.S. than Chinese investment but trade more with China than the United States. This makes them inclined to balance between the two powers and avoid situations in which they would have to make a choice.\n\nViews of International Order\n\nFor most of the ten emerging powers, economic interests converge with other motives in shaping their degree of alignment with China and Russia. One of the more important is their views of international order, which make them hesitant to isolate and exclude Russia from international forums and broadly supportive of China\u2019s critiques of the existing world order and its U.S.-led institutions.\n\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine, most Western countries saw this as the most brazen violation of international rules since World War II. U.S. President Joe Biden said that the war was part of \u201ca battle between democracy and autocracy, between liberty and repression, between a rules-based order and one governed by brute force.\u201d19 In his view, the international community had to support Ukraine in order to uphold the norms and laws that prohibit the use of force to change international borders.\n\nThe emerging powers, however, are skeptical that the United States is really concerned about the future of the rules-based international order, especially in light of the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq and recent support for Israel\u2019s bombing of Gaza. They view the war in Ukraine as springing from a decades-long NATO-Russia standoff over power in Europe, rather than a struggle over the principles of world order.20 They are thus inclined to resist U.S. demands that they sacrifice economic and political ties with China and Russia in defense of the current world order.21\n\nIn their view, a functioning international order would provide an institutional structure for working out conflicts without violence, including between warring states.22 To be sure, they do not have detailed plans for what the various components of a reformed international order ought to be, but they do have general views about what it should look like and have embraced some specific ideas for reform. They share qualms about the post-1945 international order, which they view as unfairly dominated by the former colonial powers in the West, and the United States in particular. Since Russia invaded Ukraine, for example, they have disliked the resurgence of the G7\u2014which U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan has called the \u201csteering committee of the free world\u201d\u2014because it seems to imply that the United States believes world affairs should be run primarily by a few wealthy Western economies, many of which were once colonial powers.23\n\nThese countries thus want to see greater equality on the UN Security Council, through the addition of more permanent members and an end to veto power, which they see as ineffective and undemocratic.24 They have long championed its enlargement, with Brazil and India aspiring for permanent seats and several countries calling for a permanent African representative.25 Historically, the United States has opposed enlargement of the Security Council, but the Biden administration has made an effort to build momentum behind the addition of at least six new permanent members.26 These countries also advocate reforms of the Bretton Woods institutions, including a redivision of the International Monetary Fund\u2019s quotas so that voting power is proportionate to each country\u2019s relative economic weight.27 Brazil says that a lack of reform in these financial institutions is driving the developing world toward China-led institutions such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the New Development Bank.28\n\nThe emerging powers also object to what they see as the uneven application of the rules and norms of the system. They criticize, for example, the way in which sovereignty\u2014a core principle of the UN Charter\u2014has been violated by the United States and thus view Western entreaties to support Ukraine as hypocritical.29 Similarly, they view the unilateral use of sanctions as violations of sovereignty that are inconsistent with the spirit of the existing order. U.S. third-party sanctions that do not have UN backing are particularly problematic for them.30 They take Washington\u2019s claims that it uses these tools to promote values such as human rights and democracy as justifications for its raw application of power.\n\nThe desire to change the system of global governance also influences their approaches to China. Part of what drives many developing countries toward the BRICS and the New Development Bank is the prospect of building up alternatives to older forums and institutions of the U.S.-led international order. Many of the emerging powers are positive about the rise of China if it results in a shake-up of this order, dilutes the institutional power of the United States and the West, and elevates their role on the world stage. This explains a statement by Brazil\u2019s Lula in 2023 that he and Chinese President Xi Jinping were working together to \u201cbalance world geopolitics,\u201d as well as former Argentine president Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s call in 2022 for the construction of a \u201cnew international financial architecture\u201d that accounts for developing countries\u2019 interests.31\n\nThe emerging powers nonetheless appreciate the importance of international law and existing multilateral institutions, given their weakness relative to the world\u2019s major powers. For many of them, a history of colonial rule or subjugation to foreign powers leads to embracing the UN Charter\u2019s principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity as well as opposing the use of force.32 Even if economic interests are as or more influential on their positions, these alternative visions of a just world are a meaningful factor behind their differences with the West, particularly on the question of Ukraine.\n\nGeography\n\nGeography plays a key role in shaping the positions of the ten emerging powers, in large part because of its impact on their security interests and economic flows but also because it affects historical attitudes and other influences. Geography\u2019s impact will be difficult for emerging powers to overcome. Proximity to a great power in particular creates various interests and vulnerabilities. Being near China, Russia, or the United States tends to make emerging powers adjust their policies to shield themselves from the actions of these great powers and avoid punitive measures.\n\nT\u00fcrkiye is the only country among the emerging powers to be in close proximity to the war in Ukraine. Ankara thus has an interest in helping Ukraine fight back against Russia\u2019s onslaught, but its proximity also obliges it to keep diplomatic channels open with Russia.33 Due to this proximity, T\u00fcrkiye and Russia also have a historical relationship dating back centuries. The Ottoman Empire was initially the dominant power in the region, but Russia encroached on and eventually absorbed large amounts of its territory during the eighteenth century. These realities have encouraged T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s middle-of-the-road stance on the war. Ankara has sought to play a leading role in negotiations between Russia and the West, for example, on the Black Sea Grain Initiative.\n\nGeography helps explain why Indonesia and Thailand make efforts to maintain good relations with China despite their different interests, whereas Mexico has been less concerned about doing so. For India, on one level, geography pushes New Delhi toward Washington as its border dispute with Beijing is a real source of tension and it sees itself as China\u2019s major regional competitor. At the same time, however, proximity also makes India much more exposed to retaliation from China than U.S. partners in other regions, which restrains it from throwing its whole weight behind U.S. military plans for the region, including when it comes to Taiwan.34 India\u2019s leaders are suspicious of China and view the countries\u2019 relationship as highly competitive, but they also are not keen for open conflict in the region, let alone on their border.35\n\nSimilarly, Indonesia\u2019s sprawling archipelagic geography in Southeast Asia and close proximity to China makes it especially wary about U.S.-China competition and the militarization of the Indo-Pacific.36 This, together with a troubled history with Australia, is the root of its hesitation about the United States\u2019 plan to provide Australia with nuclear submarines under the AUKUS agreement.37 Even though Indonesia has an ongoing territorial dispute with China in the South China Sea, it does not want the United States to get involved.38 Its position on U.S.-China competition is also informed by its history as a leader of the nonaligned movement during the Cold War. Thailand, for its part, has no territorial disputes with China, but its embrace of Chinese weapons and security cooperation is shaped by proximity as well.39\n\nGeography makes Mexico less likely to embrace China. It has a nearly 2,000-mile border with the United States, with which it cooperates on the cross-border movement of people and goods and which is its top trading partner.40 If Mexico were to significantly elevate its relationship with China, the United States would almost certainly retaliate.\n\nDefense Relations\n\nExisting and potential future weapons sales are an important factor shaping the positions of some of the ten emerging powers toward China and Russia. Costs, path dependency, and a desire to avoid dependence on Western arms all play a role in this.\n\nEven though its military ties with the United States have deepened in recent years, India has not ended its long-standing defense relationship with Russia and likely will not anytime soon.41 Russian weapons systems are cheaper than U.S. systems, and those that India already has are not easily replaced by U.S. arms. Moreover, New Delhi is not keen to develop a dependence on U.S. weapons, even as it seeks to benefit from closer defense cooperation with the country.42 The desire to balance against not just China but also the United States will likely factor in India\u2019s future procurement plans.\n\nT\u00fcrkiye acquired Russia\u2019s advanced S-400 missile defense system before the invasion of Ukraine, thus linking a key part of its national defense closely to the Russian military. After the acquisition, the United States sanctioned T\u00fcrkiye and removed it from the F-35 joint strike fighter program. Washington has told Ankara it can rejoin the F-35 \u201cfamily\u201d if it gives up the S-400 system, but Ankara seems set on retaining it.43 If T\u00fcrkiye keeps the system, operating it will require sustained cooperation with the Russian military.44 As a NATO member, T\u00fcrkiye is far more dependent on the West for its military equipment, but its acquisition of the S-400 is one consideration that makes it inclined to ensure friendly relations with Russia.\n\nNigeria has been purchasing more weapons from China, in part due to U.S. restrictions on weapons sales to states that do not meet certain human rights standards.45 Even if it prefers the more technologically advanced American weapons, Nigeria may see China as an easier source because it does place any human rights conditions.46 It has recently sought Beijing\u2019s help to fight a domestic insurgency, and it has signaled its interest in intelligence sharing, technology transfers, and joint training.47 The two countries have also announced plans to establish a Chinese military equipment firm in Nigeria. These defense ties likely shape Nigeria\u2019s policy calculations and make the country unlikely to side with the United States against China.\n\nBut weapons sales and defense relations do not appear to be important in other cases. Brazil\u2019s positions on China and Russia cannot be explained by defense ties. It is the leading military power in Latin America and has long invested in its defense industry, prioritizing ties to European producers such as France and Sweden.48 Indonesia has preserved friendly relations with Russia even as it has moved away from relying on its military equipment, dropping a plan to procure the Russian Su-35 fighter aircraft and turning instead to France for the Rafale.49 It increasingly imports military supplies from the United States, South Korea, and Europe.50\n\nIn general, arms sales are less important in explaining emerging powers\u2019 ties to China than they are in explaining their ties to Russia, a reflection of the fact that the former is a newer player in this global market. This could change if the desirability of Russian arms continues to decline and China remains a viable alternative to U.S. weapons for some nations.51\n\nDomestic Politics\n\nAs with many countries, domestic politics often plays a role in shaping the positions the emerging powers take in their foreign policies. The effects are naturally greatest for countries with democratic regimes, where the effects of populism, anti-colonialism, anti-Americanism, and nationalism all shape rhetoric and decisionmaking.\n\nPopulist politics, for example, has shaped Mexico\u2019s and Brazil\u2019s approaches to Russia. Mexico\u2019s L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s criticisms of U.S. policy on the Ukraine war were at least in part an expedient way for him to boost domestic support by vocally asserting Mexico\u2019s sovereignty and independence from America. He has long used criticism of the United States to play to a domestic elite audience that can be deeply skeptical of American motives and values (even if most Mexicans have favorable opinion on the United States).52 Lula\u2019s embrace of China and Russia is also a means of projecting Brazil\u2019s independence from the United States for a domestic audience and appeasing powerful, pro-China interest groups.53 A change in government might yield a somewhat different tone, but the nativist and anti-American currents on which Lula and L\u00f3pez Obrador are playing are real in both countries.\n\nBrazilian President Lula da Silva (then a presidential candidate) waves to a crowd at a campaign rally on October 9, 2022\n\nDomestic political dynamics in the emerging powers do not always play against the United States. None of these nations are eager to be subservient to China: just as nationalism and a desire for sovereignty leads them to resist America\u2019s dominance, it will also lead them to resist China\u2019s. Moreover, this will likely be more the case as China\u2019s power grows\u2014this may explain why, despite Lula\u2019s embrace of China, many Brazilians are worried that Brazil could drift too far into China\u2019s orbit.54\n\nFor now, however, most of these countries\u2019 leaders are likely to get more political benefits out of poking Washington rather than Beijing. Many of the emerging powers have strong memories of colonialism that affect their politics and thinking about the foreign policy of the United States and its European allies, some of which engaged in some of the most egregious sins of the colonial era. Anti-colonial sentiment may be less salient today, but it remains part of the political culture of many of the emerging powers. China stands to benefit from this because it was also dominated by European colonial powers in the nineteenth century and thus has an understanding of how colonialism continues to affect the emerging powers\u2019 worldviews. Meanwhile, Russia continues to benefit from the legacies of Soviet anti-imperialist propaganda. The colonial past also brings race into the equation, and China may be able to play on racial themes to make its case against the United States, particularly in a time when racial tensions have flared in the United States.\n\nColonial legacies, especially that of the unequal and often exploitative relationship that existed between the West and the rest of the world, will continue to make the emerging powers skeptical of the claims and aims of the United States in its approach to them. Even where it was not a colonial power, America will be at a disadvantage in making its case to many of the emerging powers on account of their colonial subservience to many of its European allies.\n\nRussian and Chinese Propaganda\n\nSome analysts have emphasized the role of propaganda, especially Russian disinformation, in shaping the policies of the ten emerging powers.55 Russian disinformation is real and China\u2019s propaganda efforts have also grown more robust in recent years, but the United States should be wary of mistaking genuine differences of national interest with the ten emerging powers for misunderstandings stemming from these propaganda efforts.\n\nRussia is especially adept at shaping the information space by saturating local news and social media platforms with pro-Russia and anti-NATO messages.56 It also plays on grievances against the West and capitalizes on the history of Soviet support for anti-colonial movements.57 Some of the emerging powers are more receptive to Russia\u2019s messaging, particularly those where Moscow continues to enjoy a positive image due to Soviet-era legacies. For example, the African National Congress tends to sympathize with Russian narratives due to the Soviet Union\u2019s support for the party during South Africa\u2019s anti-apartheid struggle.58 Russian disinformation can also stoke and exploit sometimes dangerous divisions inside nations.59\n\nChina\u2019s propaganda and influence operations are less sophisticated than Russia\u2019s but growing.60 It has recently expanded its capacity to disseminate its messages through state-run news agencies such as Xinhua and China Global Television News (CGTN).61 Xinhua now has thirty-seven bureaus in Africa, outnumbering all other media agencies on the continent.62 Most of its content aims to promote positive views of China, cast it as a benign alternative to the United States, and normalize its territorial claims over Taiwan and other contested areas.63 There is evidence that China\u2019s propaganda efforts may make populations in Africa and Latin America more sympathetic to its political and economic model, but the effects on the overall alignment of these countries\u2019 foreign policies appear minimal.64\n\nThere is no evidence that the presence of CGTN or Russia\u2019s RT shapes the emerging powers\u2019 foreign policy decisions in meaningful ways. To begin with, the effects of Chinese and Russian disinformation in these countries, while difficult to measure with any precision, appear limited to reinforcing preexisting tropes about Western imperialism or other historical legacies.65 The measurable effects on public opinion are not very significant, at least when it comes to Russian efforts, where there is data: a 2022 poll of 137 countries shows that Global South opinions of Russia have declined significantly since the invasion of Ukraine.66 In Latin America, for instance, where Russian propaganda has been prevalent, disapproval of Russia climbed from an average of 31 percent in 2021 to 61 percent in 2022.67 Moreover, it is unclear whether slightly more positive public views of China and Russia due to disinformation would have a significant impact on the emerging powers\u2019 foreign policy positions. In short, the role of disinformation should not obscure that, more often, the emerging powers\u2019 national interests drive them toward China or Russia.68\n\nThere is thus a risk that the United States will place excessive emphasis on the effects of Russian or Chinese disinformation in an information environment polluted by propaganda that casts U.S. policies in a negative light. Washington could do a better job of conveying its intentions and explaining its policies, but many of the emerging powers will lean toward China and Russia on many issues regardless. For example, emerging powers\u2019 views on the war in Ukraine cannot be meaningfully explained as the consequence of Russian disinformation. To view U.S. differences with the emerging powers as the result of disinformation by U.S. adversaries can be pernicious for the United States because it suggests paternalism and reinforces their view of it as a neocolonial power.\n\nDemocracy and Human Rights\n\nDefending and promoting democracy and human rights is one factor that plays a significant role in the West\u2019s approach to Russia and, to a lesser degree, China. This is not the case when it comes to the ten emerging powers. Their voting on UN resolutions indicates some concern about human rights, but that concern did not fundamentally alter their approaches to either Russia or China. For Saudi Arabia, T\u00fcrkiye, and Thailand, this could be explained by the fact that they are not democracies. Saudi Arabia itself has a bad human rights record. But even the more established democracies\u2014Argentina, Brazil, India, Mexico, and South Africa\u2014have not taken notably different positions on China and Russia. Interests supersede values when it comes to how the emerging powers approach the world. For example, Indonesia, has the world\u2019s largest Muslim population, but it has not spoken out against China\u2019s persecution of Uyghur Muslims in the Xinjiang region; Indonesia even blocked a resolution to debate this issue at the UN Human Rights Council in 2022.69 When asked if it was difficult for his country to criticize China, Jokowi said, \u201cIndonesia wants stability.\u201d70\n\nEven where the emerging powers voice concerns about human rights, this does not preclude them from maintaining friendly relations with the country in question. For example, T\u00fcrkiye has spoken out against China\u2019s policies against the Uyghur population, and it has rejected Beijing\u2019s requests to extradite Uyghurs from T\u00fcrkiye.71 But Ankara has nevertheless compartmentalized the issue to prevent it from affecting other aspects of its relationship with Beijing.\n\nDemocratic affinity with the United States does not increase the likelihood of the emerging powers aligning with it on China or Russia. For instance, despite Washington\u2019s strong support for the integrity of the election that brought Lula back to power in Brazil, the country has not aligned more closely with the United States on China\u2014in fact, it has moved in the opposite direction.72\n\nThe emerging powers often also have an abiding skepticism about the West\u2019s efforts to universalize liberalism and mold non-Western states in the shape of its democratic model. They tend to be pragmatic about the world\u2019s diverse political regimes and seek practical opportunities to profit from other states without running ideological litmus tests. This sentiment was clearly articulated by Brazil\u2019s Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira, when he said that his country will \u201calways talk to everyone,\u201d regardless of ideological orientation, under its universalist diplomatic doctrine.73\n\nFor much of the non-Western world, the West\u2019s rhetorical support for democracy has too often appeared hypocritical given long-standing U.S. and European backing for dictatorships. The picture is complicated by the fact that most of the democracies among the emerging powers\u2014Argentina, Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria, and South Africa\u2014have at some point been under autocratic regimes that were supported by the United States. It is not that they universally dislike democracy promotion, but that they see the West\u2019s pursuit of it as self-interested to the point of being disingenuous. To many of them, the United States promotes democracy selectively to punish rivals and pay lip service to liberal ideals, or as an instrument in its geopolitical struggle for influence with its rivals. This means that U.S. arguments framed in terms of democratic values carry less weight than policymakers in Washington sometimes assume (even if many foreign policy experts know this).74\n\nPotential Changes in Government and Leadership\n\nTo varying degrees, the foreign policy of each of the ten emerging powers could change if their leadership changes. For instance, the power transition that has taken place in Argentina has so far seen Milei vow to dollarize the economy, downgrade ties with China and Russia, and pull out of joining the BRICS\u2014all a far cry from his predecessor\u2019s approach. In T\u00fcrkiye, observers expected opposition leader Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu to adopt a more pro-West foreign policy if he won the 2023 presidential election.\n\nBut even in these countries where a change of leadership might have consequences, ties with China or Russia would likely remain fairly strong and domestic pressure could thwart an attempt to change course. For example, former president Jair Bolsonaro struggled to turn Brazil against China due to pressure from the agribusiness lobby.75 In Argentina, Milei may struggle to implement his more radical policies, and many of the business community\u2019s ties with China will endure.76 Since taking office, Milei has softened his rhetoric toward Beijing and made it clear that the private sector should not feel constrained in its dealings with China.77 For many of the emerging powers, their ties with China will have staying power from one government to the next.\n\nOther countries, such as India, Indonesia, and South Africa, have deep-rooted traditions of nonalignment and hedging that are unlikely to change with a change in government. Indonesia has adhered to an \u201cindependent and active foreign policy\u201d doctrine since its independence in 1945, essentially precluding it from aligning itself with any great power.78 South Africa\u2019s African National Congress, the party that has governed the country since 1994, is also committed to nonalignment.79 Though it faces a competitive election in 2024, observers still expect it to stay in power,80 but should it lose, any new government would find it hard to ditch its approach, given the public\u2019s strong support for nonalignment.81\n\nThe Limits of U.S. Influence\n\nThis chapter suggests that the United States\u2019 ability to shape the ten emerging powers\u2019 alignments is limited and varies across issues and countries. U.S. policymakers therefore need to assess whether it is worthwhile to invest time and diplomatic and economic resources into bringing any of these countries\u2019 policies more into alignment with Washington\u2019s.\n\nIt may be possible to tilt a few of the emerging powers away from Russia, and some may even move away from it over time with the realization that it has less to offer them than it claims. The United States might be able to gradually induce Argentina, Mexico, and Nigeria to adopt positions more in line with its own, but the question is whether this would be worth the effort given that the impact of doing so would be limited. A new generation of leaders whose worldview is not heavily shaped by the Cold War could also dampen the emerging powers\u2019 enthusiasm for ties to Moscow. If Russia used a nuclear weapon in Ukraine, this would likely also lead at least some of them to cut off relations.\n\nBut it will be difficult for the United States to meaningfully alter the positions of many of the emerging powers on Russia. Brazil, India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, and South Africa are likely to continue to maintain an open diplomatic posture toward Moscow. T\u00fcrkiye is the most closely aligned with the United States on Ukraine and the only emerging power to have provided the latter with weapons early on. T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s responsiveness to the U.S. request that it prevent transshipments of military goods to Russia suggests that U.S. overtures can make a difference in Ankara. But Erdo\u011fan has a long-standing pragmatic relationship with Putin that he is unlikely to abandon, and he is almost certain to respond negatively to U.S. efforts to twist his arm.\n\nThere are also limits to what the United States can achieve in influencing the emerging powers\u2019 positions on China. India is the power most closely aligned with the U.S. approach to China, but this should not be mistaken for Washington having outsized influence over New Delhi\u2019s future policy. India is aligned on China not because it wants to please the United States but because it sees a common strategic interest. India\u2019s security cooperation with the United States results almost entirely from its desire to strengthen its defenses against China.82 If Washington tried to push New Delhi to go further in countering China, such as by providing support in a Taiwan contingency, it would almost certainly fail. India will not allow its national interests to be defined, or even significantly influenced, by great powers like the United States.\n\nMeanwhile, Brazil, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, and South Africa seem set on deepening their relations with China and are likewise determined not to allow the United States to dictate the nature of these. For example, Washington failed to get these countries to restrict the use of Huawei equipment in their 5G networks. \u201cWe are not afraid of the big bad wolf,\u201d Lula\u2019s chief adviser said when asked about the United States\u2019 opposition to Brazil\u2019s technological cooperation with China.83 Indonesia\u2019s geographical and economic imperatives make a significant shift in its approach to China very unlikely. Saudi Arabia under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman will not eschew opportunities to cooperate with China. As already noted, changes in government could alter these positions to some degree in certain countries, yet the record suggests that these changes may not have a dramatic effect.\n\nThere may be more possibility for the United States to prevent Mexico from pursuing closer ties to China, but even there the picture is complex. There is little question that the United States is more important than China to Mexico\u2019s future. But as the United States considers nearshoring supply chains from China to Mexico, Chinese firms too are poised to invest heavily there, which could increase Beijing\u2019s influence.84\n\nOn narrow issues, the United States does have some capacity to shape the positions of the emerging powers. It often gets a positive response when it expresses compelling security concerns about a country\u2019s relationship with China. For example, Argentina envisaged allowing China to build a naval base in Ushuaia in 2022 but is now reconsidering the project after Washington expressed its concerns. Thailand regularly conducts military exercises with China, but it has an agreement with the United States not to use its F-16 or F-5 fighters in the exercises due to U.S. concerns about intelligence collection by China.85\n\nOn the whole, the United States\u2019 capacity to directly influence the alignments of the ten emerging powers is limited. That is why it needs a different approach.\n\nNotes\n\n1 Constanza Valdes, \u201cBrazil\u2019s Momentum as a Global Agricultural Supplier Faces Headwinds,\u201d U.S. Department of Agriculture, September 27, 2022, https://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2022/september/brazil-s-momentum-as-a-global-agricultural-supplier-faces-headwinds.\n\n2 Channing Ardnt et al., \u201cThe Ukraine War and Rising Commodity Prices: Implications for Developing Countries,\u201d Global Food Security 36, March 2023, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10015268; and Justine-Damien Gu\u00e9nette, Philip Kenworthy, and Collete Wheeler, \u201cImplications of the War in Ukraine for the Global Economy,\u201d World Bank Group, April 2022, https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/5d903e848db1d1b83e0ec8f744e55570-0350012021/related/Implications-of-the-War-in-Ukraine-for-the-Global-Economy.pdf.\n\n3 Lucian Magalhaes and Samantha Pearson, \u201cUkraine War Hits Farmers as Russia Cuts Fertilizer Supplies, Hurting Brazil,\u201d Wall Street Journal, March 5, 2022, https://www.wsj.com/articles/ukraine-war-hits-worlds-farmers-as-russia-cuts-fertilizer-supplies-hurting-brazil-11646487815; and Carla Bridi and Aamer Madhani, \u201cBrazil\u2019s Welcome of Russian Minister Prompts US Blowback,\u201d Associated Press, April 17, 2023, https://apnews.com/article/brazil-russia-lula-lavrov-putin-42c7c46fa629d98b2029aa1ff44a89b6.\n\n4 Jose Ara\u00fajo, \u201cBrazil Feeds Some 10% of World\u2019s Population, Research Finds,\u201d Reuters, March 4, 2021, https://www.reuters.com/article/brazil-grains/brazil-feeds-some-10-of-worlds-population-research-finds-idUSL2N2L23F6.\n\n5 Kali Robinson, \u201cRussia Killed the Black Sea Grain Deal.

        "text": "Remarks by CSO Gen. Chance Saltzman at the 2024 Space Symposium (April 10, 2024)\n\n\n\n\nAs Delivered by Chief of Space Operations U.S. Space Force Gen Chance Saltzman on April 10, 2024.Thanks for that kind introduction.I was a little worried you would tell a bunch of stories that I\u2019d have to refute the rest of the week so I appreciate you focusing on my better half.I\u2019m honored to be here with Secretary Kendall.During this time of Great Power Competition, he has instilled a sense of urgency and focus across this Department, and it is spreading beyond the Department to industry and international partners \u2013 you can actually feel the energy.We owe that to Secretary Kendall.So, thank you for your leadership, sir.You can feel that energy here in the Space Symposium.I feel it walking around.And then it occurs to me.Perhaps that energy is because some of you expect me to tell a dad joke\u2026[Laughter]Let me tell you trying to be funny with a space crowd is a lot of pressure\u2026I told my wife, Jennifer, that coming up with a good dad joke about space was a bit nerve-wracking\u2026but she didn\u2019t seem to understand the gravity of the situation.[Laughter/Applause]So, I went for advice to my friend Col Nick Hague\u2026great Guardian\u2026 great astronaut.Many of you know is scheduled to launch back to the International Space Station for a second tour in space later this Summer.Now as an astronaut, he does a lot of Public Affairs work so I figured he could help.Well, he started to tell me this joke about being on the ISS for 6 months and needing space, blah, blah, blah, blah\u2026and when I didn\u2019t laugh, he looked me square in the eye and said, \u201cWell, I guess you had to be there.\u201d[Laughter]Touche, touch\u00e9 Nick\u2026I\u2019d like to give a big thank you to the Space Foundation and everybody who has been involved in bringing this event together. Another terrific turnout for the space community\u2026thanks to everybody.Now it\u2019s been brought to my attention that today is the 112th anniversary of the maiden voyage of the Titanic.Not an event normally associated with space so you might wonder why that is of any importance to our space community\u2026 but in fact that disaster resulted in the first ever International Conference on the Safety of Life at Sea and the establishment of the International Ice Patrol.And these new initiatives paved the way for greater international cooperation in the sea domain, including stronger communications requirements, and shared domain awareness\u2026 in this case of course tracking and reporting icebergs \u2013 this goes to show space operators are not the only ones worried about hazardous chunks floating around in their domain.And it is in this same vein of safety that we\u2019re working hard on similar arrangements, but hopefully we won\u2019t need a Titanic-level catastrophe to drive international cooperation.Instead, we are strengthening our international efforts on space control, space cooperation and space classification to increase communication and collaboration to prevent a disaster in space.This includes full spectrum collaboration with our allies and industry\u2026planning, operations, situational awareness, information sharing, capabilities development, and everything in between.That\u2019s why this week, this gathering, is so important for the space community and so important for allies and partners.I don\u2019t think I have to convince this crowd how important space is to the Joint fight \u2013 it is in the DNA of this event.Back in 2007, I was a Commander at the 614th Space Operations Squadron, General Kevin Chilton, then Air Force Space Command Commander, talked about how \u201cspace had become integral to virtually every combat operation whether it is on land, sea, undersea, or in the air.\u201dIn 2016, Deputy Secretary of Defense Bob Work said, \u201cour space capabilities are central to our ability to project power anywhere on the globe\u2026they contribute to every aspect of the Joint multi-dimensional battle networks we assemble to fight and prevail over any opponent.\u201dAnd in 2022, our first Chief of Space Operations, General Jay Raymond, said, \u201cIf we lose our access and ability to operate freely in space\u2026we all lose.\u201dAnd just last year, my good friend, Admiral Sam Papparo while serving as the PACFLEET Commander told the PACOM Commander in an exercise, \u201cIf space is off plan, then I\u2019m off plan.\u201dSeveral different decades, several different leaders, from several different services but the same message \u2013 Our success on the battlefield, no matter the location or domain, is tied to our success in space.And I agree with them. I have been a part of this evolution personally for decades.Back in the day, it was common for planners to think of space as being kind of the \u201cicing on the cake\u201d making things better but only added in to the final product after it was fully baked.But that changed over the years and today I think the better analogy is that space is like the eggs in the batter.It is integral to the final product, a critical ingredient and once baked, it's impossible to separate.So, we do space superiority not for space\u2019s sake, we do space superiority as a critical part of the joint team, an essential element to meeting military objectives.The talking points are well known to this crowd\u2026the Air Force uses position, navigation, and timing to increase the accuracy of their munitions.The Navy uses satellite communications to provide seamless connectivity across vast maritime expanses.The Army uses tactical warning and environmental monitoring to plan and execute ground maneuvers.But now let\u2019s go a step further. Our use of space is not just limited to the military.Our economy, as with that of the rest of the world, is also dependent on unfettered access to the domain.As this crowd understands, our very way of life is directly tied to space!Remote sensing satellites provide key data for monitoring soil, snow cover, drought, and crop development.This information helps famers plan the timing and amount of irrigation they will need for crops.The precise timing provided by the GPS constellation is crucial to a variety of economic activities around the world.Communication systems, electrical power grids, and financial networks all rely on precision timing for synchronization.Wireless telephone and data networks rely on GPS timing, companies worldwide use GPS to time-stamp business transactions to ensure accuracy and traceability.Power companies rely on this timing signal for power transmission and distribution.The list goes on. In short, space capabilities and the continued access to a safe, stable, and secure space domain is a vital U.S. interest.That is why collaboration and cooperation between all space stakeholders is essential.The Space Force is committed to enhancing its partnerships with the commercial space industry, our allies, and other international partners.Today, though we find ourselves in the midst of a Great Power Competition with our adversaries that extends from the traditional terrestrial war fighting domains into space itself.As Russia has reminded us, war can return quickly, and in unexpected ways.Cooperation among industry leaders and allies has proven particularly effective in challenging Russia\u2019s efforts in Ukraine.And throughout our nation\u2019s history, military success has hinged on support from commercial industry.During the Spanish American War in 1898, the U.S. Navy relied heavily on commercial coaling stations to support its naval operations.The war, fought in both the Caribbean and the Pacific, proved naval power to be decisive, allowing expeditionary forces to disembark at desired locations unconstrained by distance.These \u201crefueling stations\u201d in Singapore, Hong Kong, Honolulu, Manilla \u2013 which were run by the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company, and the Oceanic Steamship Company \u2013 were vital to replenishing coal supplies during the war, enabling our naval ships to extend their range and remain operational for extended periods.And over the past 2 decades, the demand for military satellite communication bandwidth increased dramatically due to the heavy reliance on bandwidth-intensive operations\u2026 operations like aerial vehicle feeds-unmanned aerial vehicle feeds.To offset this demand, the Air Force partnered with Inmarsat and Intelsat to meet the rising operational demand.Now these two historical examples highlight the spectrum of commercial connections to military operations.So whereas the SATCOM example shows how commercial capabilities can add extra capacity when needed, the coaling stations represent a more complete integration into military operations.The Navy\u2019s operational infrastructure at that time was not complete without the commercial services completely incorporated.In space operations we have become more comfortable with using commercial capabilities to add capacity than we have with fully integrated commercial capabilities into our force design.It is this basic thought that led to the US Space Force\u2019s Commercial Space Strategy.Now, first I want to set some expectations for this document, released today in fact.If you read the strategy expecting to see answers to the most challenging problems of commercial integration, you will be disappointed.If you are expecting the document to outline how much money is available for us to dole out for each mission area, you will be disappointed.But, if you understand that effective integration will only come about with a common understanding of our priorities, the missions where we need help, our proposal evaluation criteria, and clear definitions of terms to enhance that collaboration\u2026I think you will find the document useful.Useful as a tool to drive process change, to shift our mindset and useful to see the Space Force\u2019s relationship with industry in a new light.As Secretary of Defense Austin stated in OSD\u2019s Commercial Space Integration Strategy, \u201cIntegrating commercial solutions, as opposed to merely augmenting existing government systems, will require a shift in approach within the Department.\u201dThe Space Force\u2019s Commercial Space Strategy is dual signed by myself and the Service Acquisition Executive, the honorable Frank Calvelli, because this is a partnership between the acquisitions community and the broader operational Space Force.Together, we are going to ensure we are optimizing resiliency and capability by balancing the decisions necessary to shift our approach.The Space Force Commercial Space Strategy follows OSD\u2019s 4 guiding principles for effective commercial integration:First, Balance \u2013 We will appropriately balance government and commercial solutions.Number two is Interoperability \u2013 We will strengthen interoperability between government and commercial solutions without stifling commercial sector innovation, speed, or scale.Third is Resilience \u2013 We will strengthen resilience by increasing the number of commercial providers, diversifying supply chains, and expanding the variety and number of solutions used.And four, Responsible Conduct \u2013 We will continue to support international norms and the DoD Tenets of Responsible Behavior in Space.And these guiding principles will assist decision-makers as they work through the myriad of activities needed to put together the force design. A force design which effectively accounts for and integrates commercial offerings.The Space Force Commercial Space Strategy will be implemented across 4 Lines of Effort.The first Line of Effort we call Collaborative Transparency.All stakeholders must be aware of the capabilities and limitations of their partners if we are to work together to solve our operational challenges.By building partnerships, collaborating with the commercial sector, the Space Force will enhance its competitive advantage by developing a comprehensive understanding of the commercial sector\u2019s innovative culture, short\u2026shorter development timelines, and a burgeoning array of commercial space solutions to the greatest extent possible.Simplify that to say if industry doesn\u2019t understand our challenges, they cannot contribute and if we do not understand what industry can bring to bear, we miss opportunities.The second Line of Effort is Operational and Technical Integration.In this line of effort, we will work the details of integrating commercial space solutions into a hybrid space architecture.This line of effort includes developing the policies, processes, technical standards, procedures that allow the commercial sector to integrate data and hardware with the Space Force\u2026 and it will require unity of effort between the Space Force and the Joint Force when conducting missions involving employment of hybrid architectures.In this portion of the strategy, we describe and prioritize the mission areas where we see the best opportunity for industry to assist the Space Force.The third line of effort is Risk Management.The integration of commercial space solutions into the Space Force architecture is not without risk.Being a part of a hybrid space architecture means being a part of a mission from competition through crisis and conflict.Ensuring that our architectures can meet the demands of each of these conditions will be essential to effective performance.The Space Force will work to ensure that all stakeholders understand risks and receive actionable, timely data to aid in risk mitigation. But this must be a collective effort by all partners.The fourth and final line of effort is about Securing the Future.In this line of effort, the Space Force will continue to seek out emerging technologies in the commercial space sector that have the potential to support the Joint and Combined Force today and in the future.The Space Force will prioritize our Science and Technology efforts that are tailored to the operational environment and optimized for fielding capabilities on operationally relevant timelines.We must continuously assess the future operating environment.What missions will need to perform, what threats will we face, and what technologies can we bring to bear to meet our operational challenges?We know we will need substantial support from the space industry to answer these vital questions.Now as we work these lines of effort, we will have to make tough choices about where to place our precious resources.As we all understand, there is never enough money to go around so we will prioritize and scrutinize our investments.We are in an era of constrained resources, and we are going to have to make trades between what we buy and what we build.Therefore, we are challenging the team to identify how best to optimize our resources as we work to deliver space capabilities needed by the Joint Force.To help industry understand our thinking, the Commercial Space Strategy outlines four broad assessment criteria that will used to evaluate proposals.The first is Operational Utility.This is the ability for a capability to satisfy a needed requirement for Space Force operations in support of a joint or combined campaign.We are not just buying things because we can \u2013 we will be contracting for capabilities that directly enable us to satisfy Service or Joint requirements and are clearly traceable to those requirements.The second principle is Feasibility, and this refers to the cost to acquire and exploit the capability at sufficient value and at a cost that the Space Force is prepared to resource. For example, evaluating the feasibility of purchasing time on a commercial ground architecture for Telemetry, Tracking, and Commanding versus buying new antennas for the Satellite Control Network or evaluating the feasibility of on-orbit refueling or servicing operations for Space Force missions.Our third criteria, Resilience by Design, centers around the capability\u2019s ability to contribute to resilience and secure an enduring competitive advantage.Commercial space capabilities enhance our capacity and resiliency but only if they contribute to defense in-depth.If commercial capabilities place a \u201cprotect and defend\u201d tax on the Space Force they may not be as valuable as those that are able to protect themselves or operate effectively under contested circumstances.Proliferated architectures, disaggregated missions, and cyber defense capabilities help to increase our resilience and decrease the risk to the Joint Force.And the final assessment criteria is Speed to Fielding.Time matters because we are running out of it.The timeline from concept to operational capability will be important.We don\u2019t have the luxury of waiting years for programs to deliver \u2013 the speed of need is right now, and we will evaluate commercial capabilities not just on their level of innovation and capability but also on the timeline to get it to the field and available for use by the Joint Force.We believe that understanding the guiding principles, our lines of effort, and the criteria we will use to assess proposals will help our industry partners better understand our needs and how best to meet them.Now as I said at the outset, the Commercial Space Strategy is not a panacea\u2026it does not provide all the answers.But I do think it frames the discussion that must take place, it sets the conditions for productive collaboration, and it starts the critical processes needed to accelerate the Purposeful Pursuit of Hybrid Space Architectures.For those partners interested in helping us fortify our capabilities, a great place to start is with our Commercial Space Office and the Space Force\u2019s Front Door.Drop by their booths this week.And I am looking forward to your feedback and working closely with all of you in this critical endeavor. We need it now and we need it to secure our future.Now speaking of our future\u2026if you will permit me to shift gears. I\u2019d like to finish up this morning by talking about my favorite subject\u2026Guardians.Another way we are ensuring our future success is by tapping into the talent and innovation of our number one resource, our Guardians.In fact, as part of our commitment to innovation and skills development, the Space Force recently hosted the second annual Guardian Field Forum.And once again, it was an amazing and productive event.The forum brought together a diverse group of relatively junior people, including Officers, Enlisted, and Civilians, to share innovative ideas with the Senior Leaders about training, acquisitions, and operations.We\u2019re still working through the many recommendations from this year\u2019s event\u2026 but I can tell you that last year, this forum yielded a variety of innovative recommendations currently being implemented, to include increasing our training pipeline capacity, outlining better collaboration between analysts and defenders in the Space Force and in US Cyber Command, and the assignment and utilization of Supra Coders.I often say that innovation is a key component of what sets our Guardians apart, and this year\u2019s Guardian Field Forum was another great demonstration of that. Our Guardians never cease to inspire and impress me.As I finish up, I am reminded of the quote from Neil deGrasse Tyson.He says, \u201cWith only rare exceptions, history shows that while strategy and bravery can win a battle, the frontiers of science and technology must be exploited to win a war.\u201dWith China and Russia now challenging our Space Superiority at levels never before seen in the domain, the frontiers of science and technology \u2013 the innovation that can be found in the commercial space sector, innovation that will be talked about in these halls \u2013 will be crucial to our success.At the Guardian Field Forum, our junior Guardians demonstrated to me that they understand we need to do things differently, and they showed me that they are interested in rolling up their sleeves to do the hard work.I think we all understand that the process needed to completely ready ourselves to meet the challenges we face is extensive and requires all hands-on deck.The Commercial Space Strategy is intended to help start that process.This strategy acknowledges that old ways of doing business will not produce the results we need.The Space Force must harness the benefits of technological innovation and emerging capabilities if we are going to be able to outcompete our competitors \u2013 or the Space Force will lose\u2026the Joint Force will lose\u2026and the U.S. will lose!Thank you again to the Space Foundation for allowing me to come out today and spend some time with you talking about our new Commercial Space Strategy.My hope is that today\u2019s conversation adds to the collective spirit of this event in the same way the words of Generals Chilton and Raymond, Admiral Papparo, and Secretary Bob Work, did over the past three decades.I look forward to continuing to partner with each and every one of you\u2026 To Secure our Nation\u2019s Interests In, From, and To Space!Thank you, and Semper Supra![Applause]",

        "text": "AI-fuelled election campaigns are here \u2014 where are the rules?\nOf the nearly two billion people living in countries that are holding elections this year, some have already cast their ballots. Elections held in Indonesia and Pakistan in February, among other countries, offer an early glimpse of what\u2019s in store as artificial intelligence (AI) technologies steadily intrude into the electoral arena. The emerging picture is deeply worrying, and the concerns are much broader than just misinformation or the proliferation of fake news.\n\nAs the former director of the Machine Learning, Ethics, Transparency and Accountability (META) team at Twitter (before it became X), I can attest to the massive ongoing efforts to identify and halt election-related disinformation enabled by generative AI (GAI). But uses of AI by politicians and political parties for purposes that are not overtly malicious also raise deep ethical concerns.\n\nGAI is ushering in an era of \u2018softfakes\u2019. These are images, videos or audio clips that are doctored to make a political candidate seem more appealing. Whereas deepfakes (digitally altered visual media) and cheap fakes (low-quality altered media) are associated with malicious actors, softfakes are often made by the candidate\u2019s campaign team itself.\n\nHow to stop AI deepfakes from sinking society \u2014 and science\n\nIn Indonesia\u2019s presidential election, for example, winning candidate Prabowo Subianto relied heavily on GAI, creating and promoting cartoonish avatars to rebrand himself as gemoy, which means \u2018cute and cuddly\u2019. This AI-powered makeover was part of a broader attempt to appeal to younger voters and displace allegations linking him to human-rights abuses during his stint as a high-ranking army officer. The BBC dubbed him \u201cIndonesia\u2019s \u2018cuddly grandpa\u2019 with a bloody past\u201d. Furthermore, clever use of deepfakes, including an AI \u2018get out the vote\u2019 virtual resurrection of Indonesia\u2019s deceased former president Suharto by a group backing Subianto, is thought by some to have contributed to his surprising win.\n\nNighat Dad, the founder of the research and advocacy organization Digital Rights Foundation, based in Lahore, Pakistan, documented how candidates in Bangladesh and Pakistan used GAI in their campaigns, including AI-written articles penned under the candidate\u2019s name. South and southeast Asian elections have been flooded with deepfake videos of candidates speaking in numerous languages, singing nostalgic songs and more \u2014 humanizing them in a way that the candidates themselves couldn\u2019t do in reality.\n\nWhat should be done? Global guidelines might be considered around the appropriate use of GAI in elections, but what should they be? There have already been some attempts. The US Federal Communications Commission, for instance, banned the use of AI-generated voices in phone calls, known as robocalls. Businesses such as Meta have launched watermarks \u2014 a label or embedded code added to an image or video \u2014 to flag manipulated media.\n\nBut these are blunt and often voluntary measures. Rules need to be put in place all along the communications pipeline \u2014 from the companies that generate AI content to the social-media platforms that distribute them.\n\nWhat the EU\u2019s tough AI law means for research and ChatGPT\n\nContent-generation companies should take a closer look at defining how watermarks should be used. Watermarking can be as obvious as a stamp, or as complex as embedded metadata to be picked up by content distributors.\n\nCompanies that distribute content should put in place systems and resources to monitor not just misinformation, but also election-destabilizing softfakes that are released through official, candidate-endorsed channels. When candidates don\u2019t adhere to watermarking \u2014 none of these practices are yet mandatory \u2014 social-media companies can flag and provide appropriate alerts to viewers. Media outlets can and should have clear policies on softfakes. They might, for example, allow a deepfake in which a victory speech is translated to multiple languages, but disallow deepfakes of deceased politicians supporting candidates.\n\nElection regulatory and government bodies should closely examine the rise of companies that are engaging in the development of fake media. Text-to-speech and voice-emulation software from Eleven Labs, an AI company based in New York City, was deployed to generate robocalls that tried to dissuade voters from voting for US President Joe Biden in the New Hampshire primary elections in January, and to create the softfakes of former Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan during his 2024 campaign outreach from a prison cell. Rather than pass softfake regulation on companies, which could stifle allowable uses such as parody, I instead suggest establishing election standards on GAI use. There is a long history of laws that limit when, how and where candidates can campaign, and what they are allowed to say.\n\nCitizens have a part to play as well. We all know that you cannot trust what you read on the Internet. Now, we must develop the reflexes to not only spot altered media, but also to avoid the emotional urge to think that candidates\u2019 softfakes are \u2018funny\u2019 or \u2018cute\u2019. The intent of these isn\u2019t to lie to you \u2014 they are often obviously AI generated. The goal is to make the candidate likeable.\n\nSoftfakes are already swaying elections in some of the largest democracies in the world. We would be wise to learn and adapt as the ongoing year of democracy, with some 70 elections, unfolds over the next few months.",
