        "text": "Democratic mood darkens as Joe Biden faces new pressure\nDemocratic mood darkens as Biden faces new pressure\n\nParty elders have reportedly privately said they do not believe Biden can win\n\nBut Mr Biden's campaign batted away reports of high-level Democratic concern as \"baseless\", insisting he would remain the nominee.\n\nPolling on Thursday by the BBC's US partner, CBS News, showed him five points behind Trump - the widest margin recorded this campaign.\n\nSome Democrats painted a bleak picture. One senior party official told the BBC that many in the party felt Mr Biden's stepping down was \"inevitable\".\n\nJoe Biden's campaign faced further pressure on Thursday amid reported concerns from Barack Obama about the presidential election, a darkening mood among Democrats and polls suggesting Donald Trump was pulling ahead.\n\nCan Biden be replaced as nominee? Not so easily\n\nMr Obama was reported by the Washington Post to have privately stated Mr Biden's chances were greatly diminished. Spokespeople for the former president have declined to comment.\n\nThe most recent lawmaker to pull support from Biden's run is Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown. On Friday, the Democrat released a statement saying it is his ''job to keep fighting'' for his constituents.\n\n\u201cI agree with the many Ohioans who have reached out to me. At this critical time, our full attention must return to these important issues. I think the President should end his campaign,\" he said.\n\nIt followed several reports that former house speaker Nancy Pelosi and the two most senior Democrats in Congress, Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer, had advised Mr Biden to consider his candidacy for the good of the party. All have rejected the reports.\n\nBut a senior Democrat source told BBC News that the mood in Washington was grim, adding: \"We are all waiting for the inevitable decision.\"\n\nAdam Smith, a Democratic congressman for Washington state, painted a similarly grim picture. Asked by BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight whether the party was \"coming to the end\" of Mr Biden's candidacy, he said: \"That is my sense\".\n\n\"I mean, I don\u2019t know. But without question, I think that is the direction that this is heading right now.\"\n\nMr Biden has faced a torrid few weeks since his poor showing in the first presidential debate late last month. He is currently in isolation in Delaware while he recovers from a Covid infection.\n\nBy contrast, Donald Trump officially accepted his party's presidential nomination at the Republican national convention in Milwaukee on Thursday evening.\n\nHe struck a confident tone in his first speech since surviving an assassination attempt. Delegates and supporters at the convention have been in high spirits all week.\n\nMr Biden has so far taken a defiant tone in response to Democratic pressure for him to step aside as his party's candidate. He continues to enjoy the public support of many politicians, including members of the powerful Congressional black caucus.\n\nMr Schumer, the Senate Majority Leader and Mr Jeffries, the ranking Democrat in the House of Representatives, are reported to have told Mr Biden last week that their colleagues in Congress were \"concerned\" that his troubles would hit their own chances of re-election.\n\nMr Schumer said the reports were \"idle speculation\", while Mr Jeffries said his was \"a private conversation that will remain private\".\n\nCNN meanwhile reported that Mrs Pelosi had told Mr Biden that polls show he cannot win. She later slammed the reporting as a \"feeding frenzy\", but did not deny that a conversation with Mr Biden had taken place.\n\nJamie Raskin, a congressman from Maryland, wrote to Mr Biden, comparing him to a baseball pitcher at the end of his career - saying there was \"no shame\" in retiring \"to the overflowing appreciation of the crowd when your arm is tired out\".\n\nBut TJ Ducklo, a Biden campaign senior adviser, slammed reports of grandee concern as \"baseless conjecture from anonymous sources\".\n\n\"Joe Biden is his party's nominee,\" he wrote on X. \"He's running for re-election.\"\n\nDeputy campaign manager Quentin Fulks said Mr Biden was \"not wavering on anything. The president has made his decision. I don't want to be rude, but I don\u2019t know how many more times we can answer that.\"\n\nMr Biden has mild upper respiratory symptoms associated with Covid but does not have a fever, presidential doctor Kevin O'Connor said on Thursday,\n\nThe White House said he was expected to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after he arrives in the US on Wednesday.",

        "text": "Who are the Democrats calling for Joe Biden to quit?\nWho are the Democrats calling time on Joe Biden?\n\nGetty Images Joe Biden does not appear ready to call time on his re-election bid\n\nJoe Biden's campaign has been thrust into a pressure cooker of doubt, as panic and worry about his election chances pour in from the highest levels of the Democratic party. In recent days, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have all reportedly expressed concerns in private to Mr Biden about his candidacy. Even his former running mate, former President Barack Obama, has reportedly said Mr Biden's chances of winning the election have greatly diminished. A 6 July letter from high-ranking congressman Jamie Raskin was made public on Thursday, where the Maryland representative compared the president to a baseball pitcher whose arm has \"tired out\". Mr Biden, 81, has repeatedly and defiantly declared he is \"not going anywhere\", urging his party to refocus on the task of defeating Donald Trump. But the calls to exit are nearing a crescendo as Democratic politicians, donors and voters speak out against the president's candidacy.\n\nWho wants Biden to go?\n\nLawmakers on both sides of the Capitol are coming out in growing numbers against the idea of Mr Biden staying in the race. It began five days after the June 27 debate with Lloyd Doggett, a 15-term Texas congressman, who said that it was time for Mr Biden to \"make the painful and difficult decision to withdraw\". Mr Doggett, 77, who sits on the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, said he respected \"all that President Biden has achieved\" but that the Democrat had failed to \"effectively defend his many accomplishments\" on the debate stage. Only three members of the Senate have so far publicly called for Mr Biden to drop out. They are Peter Welch of Vermont, Martin Heinrich of New Mexico and Montana's Jon Tester, who is fighting for re-election. They have been joined by House colleagues including the likes of Adam Schiff, California's likely next senator, and several members in tight re-election races of their own. The others are: Raul Grijalva of Arizona\n\nof Arizona Seth Moulton of Massachusetts\n\nof Massachusetts Mike Quigley of Illinois\n\nof Illinois Angie Craig of Minnesota\n\nof Minnesota Adam Smith of Washington\n\nof Washington Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey\n\nof New Jersey Pat Ryan of New York\n\nof New York Earl Blumenauer of Oregon\n\nof Oregon Hillary Scholten of Michigan\n\nof Michigan Brad Schneider of Illinois\n\nof Illinois Ed Case of Hawaii\n\nof Hawaii Greg Stanton of Arizona\n\nof Arizona Jim Himes of Connecticut\n\nof Connecticut Scott Peters of California\n\nof California Eric Sorensen of Illinois\n\nof Illinois Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington state\n\nof Washington state Mike Levin of California\n\nof California Brittany Pettersen of Colorado\n\nof Colorado Jim Costa of California\n\nof California Sean Casten of Illinois\n\nof Illinois Jared Huffman of California\n\nof California Marc Veasey of Texas\n\nof Texas Chuy Garcia of Illinois\n\nof Illinois Mark Pocan of Wisconsin\n\nof Wisconsin Greg Landsman of Ohio\n\nof Ohio Zoe Lofgren of California\n\n'Hard to imagine' Biden serving full term, says Michael Douglas\n\nOther prominent figures have also joined the growing chorus: New York Lt Gov Antonio Delgado , a former member of the House of Representatives, said Mr Biden \"can add to his legacy, showing his strength and grace, by ending his campaign\".\n\n, a former member of the House of Representatives, said Mr Biden \"can add to his legacy, showing his strength and grace, by ending his campaign\". Ex-Ohio congressman Tim Ryan , former housing secretary Julian Castro and self-help guru Marianne Williamson - all former primary opponents of Mr Biden - have called on him to withdraw.\n\n, former housing secretary and self-help guru - all former primary opponents of Mr Biden - have called on him to withdraw. George Clooney , the Hollywood actor and major party fundraiser, said in The New York Times that Mr Biden could not beat time. His article was titled: \"I Love Joe Biden. But We Need a New Nominee.\"\n\n, the Hollywood actor and major party fundraiser, said in The New York Times that Mr Biden could not beat time. His article was titled: \"I Love Joe Biden. But We Need a New Nominee.\" Disney heiress Abigail Disney, another megadonor, said she was suspending donations to Democrats \"unless and until they replace Biden at the top of the ticket\".\n\nWhat are others saying?\n\nSenior Democrats, including party leaders in Washington, have parsed their tongues in public on whether Mr Biden should continue his 2024 bid. Nancy Pelosi, the former House Speaker, had previously declined to directly answer whether she wanted him to keep running. She did so on MSNBC's Morning Joe, the president's favourite news programme. \"I want him to do whatever he decides to do,\" she said, adding that \"time is running short\" for him to make that call. CNN reported that since then, Mrs Pelosi had met with Mr Biden privately and told him that polls show he cannot win in November. She later slammed the reporting as a \"feeding frenzy\", but did not deny that a conversation with Mr Biden had taken place. Her replacement as House Democratic chief, Hakeem Jeffries, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer have reportedly also met Mr Biden to privately express both their concerns about his ability to win re-election and the potential impact of his candidacy on Democratic hopes of controlling the House and Senate.\n\nBiden is on 'really good form' says Starmer",

        "text": "Election 2024: Will Joe Biden Exit the Presidential Race?\nThe nation turned its eyes to Milwaukee last night as Donald J. Trump accepted the Republican Party\u2019s presidential nomination for the third election in a row. But the question on everyone\u2019s mind inside and outside the Fiserv Forum was, who will be his opponent in November?\n\nThe pressure on Joe Biden to step aside as the Democratic presidential candidate that died down last week flared again this week. The news media reported that former President Barack Obama, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, and House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi each told Biden privately in their own way that his chances of winning were fading and that he would be imperiling the party if he stayed in the race. Jon Tester of Montana and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico became the second and third Democratic senators to call on Biden to head to the sidelines. California Democratic Senate candidate Adam Schiff, a close confidant of Pelosi\u2019s, added his name to those urging Biden to step down. Just this morning, four Democratic Congressmen asked Biden \u201cto pass the torch to a new generation of Democratic leaders.\u201d More defections, possibly a stampede of them, seem likely.\n\nBiden, who tested positive for Covid on Wednesday and had to leave the campaign trail, can\u2019t find much comfort in poll numbers or campaign contributions. An AP-NORC poll out this week found that 65 percent of Democrats want him to leave the race, and just 27 percent are very or extremely confident about his mental capacity to be an effective president. Campaign contributions in July have fallen to less than half the $50 million originally projected.\n\nThe Water's Edge James M.

The Democratic Party\u2019s rules establish a process for replacing a potential nominee.\n\nThe question is instead whether Biden will leave the race. It is difficult, though not impossible, to push him off the ticket. But that would mean a bruising internal fight that would likely guarantee what Biden\u2019s critics are seeking to prevent\u2014Trump\u2019s election. That outcome could happen even if Biden bows out gracefully. Presidential campaigns are unforgiving, especially for new candidates and campaign organizations in flux.\n\nBiden continues to signal that he will remain in the race. His campaign chair told Morning Joe today that he will return to the campaign trail next week. That, of course, is not dispositive. If Biden decides to step aside, it\u2019s in his interest and the Democratic Party\u2019s to break that news rather than telegraph it.\n\nOne group rooting for Biden to stay in the race is the Trump campaign. It has built its Election 2024 strategy around attacking his weaknesses. Indeed, Trump advisers have attacked the dump-Biden movement as illegitimate. Senior Trump campaign adviser Chris LaCivita yesterday called the effort an \u201cattempted coup.\u201d If Biden does stand down, former Trump adviser Stephen Miller has signaled the Trump campaign\u2019s likely line of attack: \u201cNothing says democracy like holding a fake primary and then having donors handpick a nominee behind closed doors.\u201d\n\nWhether Biden stays in the race or not, the protracted debate over his fitness will only further complicate U.S. foreign policy. As I have noted before, countries, like people, hedge their bets. Many foreign capitals are already concluding that they will be dealing with a new president next January and trimming their sails accordingly. And if Biden does decide to step aside, he will automatically become a lame duck. That will raise a whole new set of questions and challenges.\n\nCampaign Update\n\nLast Saturday night\u2019s attempted assassination of Trump shocked the world and raised difficult questions about why the Secret Service and other law enforcement officials ignored warning signs that a shooter threatened the president. What\u2019s unknown is how the shooting will affect the presidential race, both in terms of tone and outcome. Fears of violence on the campaign trail were voiced long before Saturday. Democratic and Republican leaders\u2014there were exceptions\u2014joined Trump and Biden in calling for calm and a lowering of the political rhetoric, but fears about escalating violence and the fraying of U.S. democracy remain real. Adding an additional layer of concern are reports that the U.S. intelligence community has compiled substantial evidence that Iran is seeking to assassinate Trump.\n\nWith the selection of J.D. Vance as Trump\u2019s running mate, Democrats and Republicans have turned to negotiations over the timing and host of a vice-presidential debate. Trump agreed back in May on behalf of his yet-to-be-named nominee to a debate on either July 23 or August 13, or on an unspecified date after the Democratic National Convention closed. Harris had previously agreed to the July and August dates. The sticking point was which network would host the event. Harris agreed to appear on CBS, while Trump called for the debate to be on Fox. The July 23 date is no longer an option, and given the uncertainty about the Democratic ticket, August 13 likely isn\u2019t either.\n\nJudge Aileen Cannon dismissed the case that Special Counsel Jack Smith filed charging Trump with mishandling classified-documents case. Cannon based her ruling on the grounds that Smith's appointment was unconstitutional. Cannon\u2019s decision rejected longstanding precedent and builds on a point that Justice Clarence Thomas made in his concurring opinion in the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision on Trump\u2019s claim to unqualified presidential immunity. The Justice Department will likely appeal Cannon\u2019s ruling. Regardless of how that appeal fares, Trump will not face prosecution on the classified-documents charges before Election Day.\n\nWhat the Candidates Are Saying\n\nTrump\u2019s acceptance speech to the Republican National Convention last night set the record for length. It clocked in at a shade over ninety-two minutes. He beat the old record, which he set back in 2016, by nearly eighteen minutes.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Trump at RNC Video Pause Video Pause Trump at RNC Embed\n\nTrump didn\u2019t break any new policy ground in his remarks. As usual, he made a number of false claims, which news outlets fact-checked even if many voters don\u2019t seem to care. On the foreign policy front, he didn\u2019t stop North Korean missile launches\u2014they resumed before he left office. He didn\u2019t defeat ISIS in a \u201ccouple of months.\u201d The fight against ISIS, which began during Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, continued for more than two years into his presidency. And while China signed a $50 billion trade deal with Trump, it didn\u2019t live up to the terms of the agreement. The United States didn\u2019t leave $85 billion worth of military equipment behind in Afghanistan; the number was closer to $7 billion.\n\nBloomberg Businessweek ran a story this week based on an interview with Trump at Mar-a-Lago. Much of the interview addressed economic matters. But Trump\u2019s answer to whether he would defend Taiwan against Chinese aggression likely set off alarm bells in Taipei and triggered smiles in Beijing. Trump complained that Taiwan took away the U.S. chip industry and said:\n\nTaiwan should pay us for defense. You know, we\u2019re no different than an insurance company. Taiwan doesn\u2019t give us anything. Taiwan is 9,500 miles away. It\u2019s 68 miles away from China. A slight advantage, and China\u2019s a massive piece of land, they could just bombard it.\n\nHe went on to add that if he were China \u201cI wouldn\u2019t feel so secure right now.\u201d No doubt.\n\nJoe Biden sat down with Lester Holt of NBC News for a one-on-one interview. Most of the conversation dealt with Biden\u2019s reaction to the attempted assassination of Trump, heated rhetoric on the campaign trail, and Biden\u2019s fitness for office. Foreign policy did not get a mention.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Biden Holt Interview Video Pause Video Pause Biden Holt Interview Embed\n\nBiden did apologize for saying a week ago that \u201cit\u2019s time to put Trump in the bull\u2019s-eye.\u201d\n\nWhat the Pundits Are Saying\n\nPolitico\u2019s Jonathan Martin detailed the alarm that Trump\u2019s pick of Vance to be his running mate has created among internationalist Republicans. Martin doesn\u2019t pull any punches about the division within the GOP over how active the United States should be in the world and where: \u201cTrump didn\u2019t just select a running mate here\u2014he doused political kerosene on the raging Republican fire over foreign policy.\u201d\n\nThe New Yorker\u2019s Jonathan Blitzer explored the evolution of the network of far-right groups that are championing Trump\u2019s election and creating the agenda they hope he will enact should he return to the White House. Blitzer wrote that \u201cthe Trump campaign has tried to distance itself from the most radical aspects of Project 2025. There are no benefits\u2014only political liabilities\u2014to endorsing so many specifics. Trump\u2019s supporters already know what he stands for, in a general sense. And there is the more delicate matter of the former President\u2019s ego. \u2018He wouldn\u2019t want to be seen as taking guidance from any other human being,\u2019 the former senior White House official told me. \u2018He doesn\u2019t like to be seen as someone who doesn\u2019t know everything already.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhat the Polls Show\n\nThe Pew Research Center issued a report today showing that American adults under the age of thirty have different foreign policy priorities than their elders do. Six-out-of-ten Americans between the ages of eighteen and twenty-nine flag combating climate change as their top priority. Only about four-in-ten Americans over the age of thirty feel the same way. Conversely, nine-in-ten Americans over the age of fifty see preventing terrorism as a top priority. Just 55 percent of young Americans do. The young and the old show similar divergences on issues such as Iran, Israel, NATO, and Ukraine, with younger voters being less supportive. One thing to keep in mind. Older Americans are far more likely to vote than younger ones.\n\nThe Campaign Schedule\n\nThe Democratic National Convention opens in Chicago in thirty-one days (August 19, 2024).\n\nThe second presidential debate is in fifty-three days (September 10, 2024).\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s sentencing hearing on his New York felony convictions is in sixty-one days (September 18, 2024).\n\nThe first in-person absentee voting in the nation begins in Minnesota and South Dakota in sixty-three days (September 20, 2024).\n\nElection Day is 109 days away.\n\nInauguration Day is 185 days away.\n\nAliya Kaisar assisted in the preparation of this post.",

        "text": "Silicon shift? Major tech titans throw financial, political support to Trump\nMilwaukee \u2014 Amid the pomp and partying at the Republican National Convention, one development is adding to the air of triumphalism in Milwaukee: A slew of major tech players have turned their political and financial support to former President Donald Trump and the Republican Party, signaling a possible realignment in support from traditionally liberal Silicon Valley.\n\nIt began with reports at the beginning of the week that Elon Musk had pledged $45 million a month for at least the next three months to Trump's election effort. This was reinforced by the selection of Ohio Sen. JD Vance, a former venture capitalist who has nurtured close relationships with right-leaning or libertarian tech leaders in Silicon Valley, as Trump's running mate. By Tuesday, Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, co-founders of a high-flying venture capital firm, had endorsed Trump on their podcast and said they would kick in financially to support the former president.\n\nIt's an adage in American politics that \"money follows money,\" so many expect the influx of contributions from Musk and the other tech moguls to generate a lot more cash for Republicans in the coming weeks. Those at the vanguard of this trend are taking full advantage of the momentum.\n\nVenture capitalist David Sacks, a past supporter of Democrat Hillary Clinton and relatively early adopter of the Trump tech money machine, is urging his comrades to get off the sidelines and give to the Republican nominee. He took to X this week with a social media post that listed the growing number of Trump contributors, including Musk, Andreessen Horowitz, Joe Lonsdale, a co-founder of the data mining company, Palantir, and Doug Leone, the billionaire venture capitalist and major tech investor, who have all given to Trump.\n\n\"Come on in, the water's warm,\" Sacks wrote.\n\nAn angel investor in major companies like SpaceX, Uber and Palantir, Sacks believes Trump has a much larger base of support in Silicon Valley than is readily apparent but that those who back him are afraid to admit it publicly in a place where the prevailing politics have been overwhelmingly liberal. Still, he says his fellow techies are gaining the courage of their convictions and senses an inflection point.\n\n\"I think what we're seeing is that each incremental endorsement makes the next one more likely,\" Sacks told CBS News in an email. \"Now the dominoes are falling quite quickly.\"\n\nHow significant this Silicon shift is \u2014 and how lasting it will be \u2014 is a matter of debate. Some of those who closely track campaign finance say it's a bit too early to tell. Moreover, there's no sign yet that most of the dominant tech platforms, like Meta, Google or Apple, or their leaders, are moving into the Trump camp.\n\n\"This isn't about Big Tech players who have traditionally leaned Democratic switching sides,\" said Anna Massoglia of OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan watchdog group that keeps tabs on political donations. \"Instead, we're seeing an anti-establishment conservative faction starting to become more politically active,\" Massoglia added, cautioning that there is not enough data yet to know whether this represents a sea change or just a temporary shift.\n\nEither way, campaign finance experts say the amount of money moving to Trump is significant and could have a material effect in this election cycle. If Elon Musk follows through on his pledge $45 million per month pledge, he'd immediately catapult into the ranks of the top five or 10 donors of the past few elections, including mega-donors like George Soros, who backs Democrats, and Miriam Adelson and her late husband Sheldon, who has bankrolled Trump the tune of more than $200 million.\n\nMusk and many of his fellow tech titans who have opened up the spigot for Trump are backing Trump for the first time. Some have supported Democrats, including Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and Joe Biden in 2020.\n\n\"What's new here is the emergence of a group of people who were not previously committed now spending hundreds of millions of dollars trying to elect Republicans and certainly trying to get Donald Trump elected,\" says Saurav Ghosh, director of federal campaign finance reform at the Campaign Legal Center.\n\nBut why is this shift happening in the first place? There are different theories.\n\nTo the Trump campaign, the shift is the result of its candidate's pro-business agenda.\n\n\"In the tech sector we've seen this surge of support as fundamentally driven by President Trump's pro-business vision, reducing regulatory burdens and producing an economic environment in which American innovation can thrive,\" said Brian Hughes, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign.\n\nIn some instances, the connection between policies and financial support from the tech world has been explicit. The cryptocurrency industry's underwriting of the Trump election effort is one such example. After a months-long conversation between prominent crypto investors \u2014 including Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss \u2014 and the Trump campaign, the former president publicly embraced cryptocurrencies. The campaign's website declared that it was part of a counteroffensive against \"socialistic government control.\" Not long after that, the Winklevoss twins each donated a cool $1 million in Bitcoin to Trump, while slapping at Mr. Biden's \"war against crypto.\" The Trump campaign opened a portal to accept crypto donations, the first major party general election presidential campaign to do so.\n\nThe crypto industry's embrace of Trump has been disconcerting to some Democrats. The Washington Post reported that Biden administration officials held a meeting last week to try to repair the relationship. According to the report, Biden senior adviser Anita Dunn \"appeared taken aback by the open hostility\" from the tech start-up community.\n\nEven in Trump world there is a sharp debate about how meaningful the recent flow of tech money into the Trump reelection effort is. Roger Stone, one of the most fervent Trump supporters and a MAGA diehard, expressed skepticism.\n\n\"I suspect it's transactional for this election,\" Stone said in the bar of Milwaukee's tony Trade Hotel, where the high command of the Trump campaign was staying during the convention. He attributed the development to Vance's selection as VP.\n\nIt is true that many of the biggest players in Silicon Valley who have supported Trump, including Musk and David Sacks, are also big boosters of Vance. Musk hailed Trump's choice on X shortly after it was announced. For his part, Sacks kicked in a million dollars to Vance's 2022 Ohio Senate campaign, and Vance was instrumental in organizing a $12 million Trump fundraiser that Sacks co-hosted in June.\n\nBut the tech mogul most important to Vance's political rise has a more complicated history with Trump. Peter Thiel, the mercurial co-founder of PayPal and Palantir, met Vance when he was a law student at Yale and took him under his wing, giving him jobs, contributing lavishly to his political campaigns, and eventually introducing him to Trump.\n\nThiel was the first major Silicon Valley player to open up his wallet for Trump, when he donated $1.25 million during the 2016 campaign. That earned him a speaking gig at the GOP convention in Cleveland and sent tremors through Silicon Valley and drew scorn from many other tech leaders.\n\nBut tech titans can be fickle with their money. Eight years after breaking a Silicon Valley taboo and wholeheartedly backing Trump, Thiel decided that he is disillusioned with the former president \u2014 and other politicians \u2014 who he believes haven't delivered the change they promised. He recently announced that he won't be giving any money to Trump or other candidates. \"You hold a gun to my head and I will vote for Trump,\" he said at the Aspen Ideas Festival in June.",

        "text": "FiveThirtyEight\nAmerican news website\n\n538, originally rendered as FiveThirtyEight, is an American website that focused on opinion poll analysis, politics, economics, and sports blogging in the United States.[2] Founder Nate Silver left in 2023, taking the rights to his forecasting model with him to his website Silver Bulletin.[3][4][5] 538's new owner Disney hired G. Elliott Morris to develop a new model.[3][4] On September 18, 2023, the original website domain at fivethirtyeight.com was closed, and web traffic became redirected to ABC News pages.[2] The logo was replaced, with the name 538 now used instead of FiveThirtyEight.\n\nThe website, which takes its name from the number of electors in the United States electoral college,[538 1] was founded on March 7, 2008, as a polling aggregation website with a blog created by analyst Nate Silver. In August 2010, the blog became a licensed feature of The New York Times online and was renamed FiveThirtyEight: Nate Silver's Political Calculus. In July 2013, ESPN acquired FiveThirtyEight, hiring Silver as editor-in-chief and a contributor for ESPN.com; the new publication launched on March 17, 2014.[6] Since then, the FiveThirtyEight blog has covered a broad spectrum of subjects including politics, sports, science, economics, and popular culture. In 2018, the operations were transferred from ESPN to sister property ABC News (also under parent The Walt Disney Company).\n\nDuring the presidential primaries and general election of 2008 the site compiled polling data through a unique methodology derived from Silver's experience in sabermetrics to \"balance out the polls with comparative demographic data\".[7][8] Silver weighted \"each poll based on the pollster's historical track record, sample size, and recentness of the poll\".[9] Since the 2008 election, the site has published articles\u2014typically creating or analyzing statistical information\u2014on a wide variety of topics in current politics and political news. These included a monthly update on the prospects for turnover in the Senate; federal economic policies; Congressional support for legislation; public support for health care reform, global warming legislation and LGBT rights; elections around the world; marijuana legalization; and numerous other topics. The site and its founder are best known for election forecasts, including the 2012 presidential election in which FiveThirtyEight correctly predicted the vote winner of all 50 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nFiveThirtyEight has won numerous awards. These include Bloggie Awards for Best Political Coverage in 2008 and Best Weblog about Politics in 2009 as well as Webbies for Best Political Blog in 2012 and 2013. While under the ownership of ESPN in 2016, FiveThirtyEight won the Data Journalism Website of the Year award from the Global Editors Network.\n\nMethods [ edit ]\n\nOne aspect of the site is Silver's efforts to rank pollsters by accuracy, weight their polls accordingly, and then supplement those polls with his own electoral projections based on demographics and prior voting patterns. Silver said: \"I did think there was room for a more sophisticated way of handling these things.\"[10][11]\n\nFiveThirtyEight weighs pollsters' historical track records through a complex methodology,[538 2] and assigns them values to indicate \"Pollster-Introduced Error\". At its base, Silver's method is similar to other analysts' approaches to taking advantage of the multiple polls that are conducted within each state: he averaged the polling results. But especially in the early months of the election season polling in many states is sparse and episodic. The \"average\" of polls over an extended period (perhaps several weeks) would neither reveal the true state of voter preferences at the present time, nor provide an accurate forecast of the future. One approach to this problem was followed by Pollster.com: if enough polls were available, it computed a locally weighted moving average or LOESS.\n\nWhile adopting such an approach in his own analysis, Silver reasoned that there was additional information available in polls from \"similar\" states that might help to fill the gaps in information about the trends in a given state. Accordingly, he adapted an approach that he had previously used in his baseball forecasting: using nearest neighbor analysis he first identified \"most similar states\" and then factored into his electoral projections for a given state the polling information from \"similar states\". He carried this approach one step further by also factoring national polling trends into the estimates for a given state. Thus, his projections were not simply based on the polling trends in a given state.\n\nFurthermore, a basic intuition that Silver drew from his analysis of the 2008 Democratic party primary elections was that the voting history of a state or Congressional district provided clues to current voting. This is what allowed him to beat all the pollsters in his forecasts in the Democratic primaries in North Carolina and Indiana, for example.[12] Using such information allowed Silver to come up with estimates of the vote preferences even in states for which there were few if any polls. For his general election projections for each state, in addition to relying on the available polls in a given state and \"similar states\", Silver estimated a \"538 regression\" using historical voting information along with demographic characteristics of the states to create an estimate that he treated as a separate poll (equivalent to the actually available polls from that state). This approach helped to stabilize his projections, because if there were few if any polls in a given state, the state forecast was largely determined by the 538 regression estimate.\n\nTransparency of pollster ratings [ edit ]\n\nOn June 6, 2010, FiveThirtyEight posted pollster rankings that updated and elaborated Silver's efforts from the 2008 election. Silver expanded the database to more than 4,700 election polls and developed a model for rating the polls that was more sophisticated than his original rankings.[538 3][13] Silver responded on 538: \"Where's the transparency? Well, it's here [citing his June 6 article], in an article that contains 4,807 words and 18 footnotes. Every detail of how the pollster ratings are calculated is explained. It's also here [referring to another article], in the form of Pollster Scorecards, a feature which we'll continue to roll out over the coming weeks for each of the major polling firms, and which will explain in some detail how we arrive at the particular rating that we did for each one\".[538 4]\n\nAs for why the complete 538 polling database had not been released publicly, Silver responded: \"The principal reason is because I don't know that I'm legally entitled to do so. The polling database was compiled from approximately eight or ten distinct data sources, which were disclosed in a comment which I posted shortly after the pollster ratings were released, and which are detailed again at the end of this article. These include some subscription services, and others from websites that are direct competitors of this one. Although polls contained in these databases are ultimately a matter of the public record and clearly we feel as though we have every right to use them for research purposes, I don't know what rights we might have to re-publish their data in full.\" Silver also commented on the fact that the 538 ratings had contributed to Markos Moulitsas's decision to end Daily Kos's use of Research 2000 as its pollster.[14]\n\nOn June 11, 2010, Mark Blumenthal also commented on the question of transparency in an article in the National Journal titled \"Transparency In Rating: Nate Silver's Impressive Ranking Of Pollsters' Accuracy Is Less Impressive In Making Clear What Data Is Used\".[15] He noted that in the case of Research 2000 there were some discrepancies between what Silver reported and what the pollster itself reported. Other researchers questioned aspects of the methodology.[16]\n\nOn June 16, 2010, Silver announced on his blog that he is willing to give all pollsters who he had included in his rating a list of their polls that he had in his archive, along with the key information that he used (poll marginals, sample size, dates of administration); and he encouraged the pollsters to examine the lists and the results to compare them with the pollster's own record and make corrections.[538 5]\n\nIn September 2014, Silver put into the public domain all of his pollster ratings,[538 6] as well as descriptive summary data for all of the more than 6,600 polls in his data collection for the final three weeks of U.S. presidential primaries and general elections, state governor elections, and U.S. Senate and U.S. Congress elections for the years 1998\u20132012.[17] In addition to updating his pollster ratings, he published an updated methodological report.[538 7]\n\nOrigin [ edit ]\n\nLogo for FiveThirtyEight until 2023\n\nNate Silver started FiveThirtyEight in early March 2008, published under the pseudonym Poblano, the same name that he had used since November 2007 when he began publishing a diary on the political blog Daily Kos.[18] The name FiveThirtyEight derives from the 538 electors in the United States Electoral College.[19] Writing for Daily Kos, Silver had gained a following, especially for his primary election forecast on Super Tuesday, February 5, 2008.[20][21] From that primary election day, which included contests in 24 states plus American Samoa, Poblano predicted that Barack Obama would come away with 859 delegates, and Hillary Clinton 829; in the final contests, Obama won 847 delegates and Clinton 834. Based on this result, New York Times op-ed columnist William Kristol wrote: \"And an interesting regression analysis at the Daily Kos Web site (poblano.dailykos.com) of the determinants of the Democratic vote so far, applied to the demographics of the Ohio electorate, suggests that Obama has a better chance than is generally realized in Ohio\".[22]\n\nFiveThirtyEight gained further national attention for beating out most pollsters' projections in the North Carolina and Indiana Democratic party primaries on May 6, 2008. As Mark Blumenthal wrote in National Journal, \"Over the last week, an anonymous blogger who writes under the pseudonym Poblano did something bold on his blog, FiveThirtyEight.com. He posted predictions for the upcoming primaries based not on polling data, but on a statistical model driven mostly by demographic and past vote data. ... Critics scoffed. Most of the public polls pointed to a close race in North Carolina. ... But a funny thing happened. The model got it right.\"[12] Silver relied on demographic data and on the history of voting in other states during the 2008 Democratic primary elections.[10] On May 30, 2008, Silver revealed his true identity for the first time to his FiveThirtyEight readers.[538 8] After that date, he published just four more diaries on Daily Kos.[18]\n\nAs the primary season was coming to an end, Silver began to build a model for the general election race. This model, too, relied in part on demographic information but mainly involved a complex method of aggregating polling results. In 2008, Rasmussen Reports had an apparently short-term partnership with FiveThirtyEight in order to include this unique methodology for generating poll averages in their \"Balance of Power Calculator\".[23] At the same time, FiveThirtyEight's daily \"Today's Polls\" column began to be mirrored on \"The Plank\", a blog published by The New Republic.[24]\n\nIn July 2008, the site began to report regular updates of projections of 2008 U.S. Senate races. Special procedures were developed relying on both polls and demographic analysis. The projections were updated on a weekly basis.[538 9]\n\nBy early October 2008, FiveThirtyEight approached 2.5 million visitors per week, while averaging approximately 400,000 per weekday.[538 10] During October 2008 the site received 3.63 million unique visitors, 20.57 million site visits, and 32.18 million page views.[538 11] On Election Day, November 4, 2008, the site had nearly 5 million page views.[25]\n\nFinal projections of 2008 elections [ edit ]\n\nIn the final update of his presidential forecast model at midday of November 4, 2008, Silver projected a popular vote victory by 6.1 percentage points for Barack Obama and electoral vote totals of 349 (based on a probabilistic projection) or 353 (based on fixed projections of each state).[538 12] Obama won with 365 electoral college votes. Silver's predictions matched the actual results everywhere except in Indiana and the 2nd congressional district of Nebraska, which awards an electoral vote separately from the rest of the state. His projected national popular vote differential was below the actual figure of 7.2 points.\n\nThe forecasts for the Senate proved to be correct for every race, but the near stalemate in Minnesota led to a recount that was settled only on June 30, 2009. In Alaska, after a protracted counting of ballots, on November 19 Republican incumbent Ted Stevens conceded the seat to Democrat Mark Begich, an outcome that Silver had forecast on election day.[26] In Georgia, a run-off election on December 2 led to the re-election of Republican Saxby Chambliss, a result that was also consistent with Silver's original projection.\n\nThe ground game and \"On the Road\" [ edit ]\n\nDuring the 2008 electoral campaign, Sean Quinn, a second contributor, drew on his knowledge and experience with campaign organizations to evaluate the ground game and \"get out the vote\" strategies of the McCain and Obama campaign teams. A poker player, Quinn drew an analogy between Barack Obama's electoral strategy and a poker player having multiple \"outs\" for winning a hand.[27]\n\nIn September, Quinn launched a series of essays under the name On the Road.[28] Quinn traveled from state to state telling the story of the campaign from the electoral battleground, drawing on observations and interviews with grassroots campaign workers.\n\nAfter the 2008 U.S. election [ edit ]\n\nFocus [ edit ]\n\nDuring the first two months after the election, no major innovations in content were introduced. A substantial percentage of the articles focused on Senatorial races: the runoff in Georgia, won by Saxby Chambliss; recounts of votes in Alaska (won by Mark Begich), and Minnesota (Al Franken vs. Norm Coleman); and the appointments of Senatorial replacements in Colorado, New York, and Illinois.\n\nAfter President Obama's inauguration, Sean Quinn reported that he was moving to Washington, D.C., to continue political writing from that locale.[538 13] On February 4, 2009, he became the first blogger to join the White House press corps.[538 14] After that time, however, he contributed only a handful of articles to FiveThirtyEight.\n\nDuring the post-2008 election period Silver devoted attention to developing some tools for the analysis of forthcoming 2010 Congressional elections,[538 15][538 16] as well as discussing policy issues and the policy agenda for the Obama administration, especially economic policies.[538 17][538 18] He developed a list of 2010 Senate races in which he made monthly updates of predicted party turnover.[538 19]\n\nLater, Silver adapted his methods to address a variety of issues of the day, including health care reform, climate change, unemployment, and popular support for same-sex marriage.[29] He wrote a series of columns investigating the credibility of polls by Georgia-based firm Strategic Vision, LLC. According to Silver's analysis, Strategic Vision's data displayed statistical anomalies that were inconsistent with random polling. Later, he uncovered indirect evidence that Strategic Vision may have gone as far as to fabricate the results of a citizenship survey taken by Oklahoma high school students, which led him to denounce Strategic Vision as \"disreputable and fraudulent\".[30][538 20][538 21][538 22][538 23][538 24][31][a] FiveThirtyEight devoted more than a dozen articles to the Iranian presidential election in June 2009, assessing of the quality of the vote counting. International affairs columnist Renard Sexton began the series with an analysis of polling leading up to the election;[538 25] then posts by Silver, Andrew Gelman and Sexton analyzed the reported returns and political implications.[538 26]\n\nFiveThirtyEight covered the November 3, 2009, elections in the United States in detail.[538 27][538 28] FiveThirtyEight writers Schaller, Gelman, and Silver also gave extensive coverage to the January 19, 2010 Massachusetts special election to the U.S. Senate. The \"538 model\" once again aggregated the disparate polls to correctly predict that the Republican Scott Brown would win.[538 29]\n\nIn spring 2010, FiveThirtyEight turned a focus on the United Kingdom general election scheduled for May 6, with a series of more than forty articles on the subject that culminated in projections of the number of seats that the three major parties were expected to win.[538 30] Following a number of preview posts in January[538 31] and February,[538 32] Renard Sexton examined subjects such as the UK polling industry[538 33][538 34][538 35] and the 'surge' of the third-party Liberal Democrats,[538 36] while Silver, Sexton and Dan Berman[b] developed a seat projection model. The UK election was the first time the FiveThirtyEight team did an election night 'liveblog' of a non-U.S. election.[538 37]\n\nIn April 2010, The Guardian published Silver's predictions for the 2010 United Kingdom General Election. The majority of polling organisations in the UK use the concept of uniform swing to predict the outcome of elections. However, by applying his own methodology, Silver produced very different results, which suggested that a Conservative victory might have been the most likely outcome.[33] After a series of articles, including critiques and responses to other electoral analysts, his \"final projection\" was published on the eve of the election.[538 38] In the end, Silver's projections were off the mark, particularly compared with those of some other organizations, and Silver wrote a post mortem on his blog.[538 39] Silver examined the pitfalls of the forecasting process,[538 39] while Sexton discussed the final government agreement between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats.[538 40]\n\nPartnership with The New York Times: 2010\u20132013 [ edit ]\n\nOn June 3, 2010, Silver announced that in early August the blog would be \"relaunched under a NYTimes.com domain\".[538 41][34][35] The transition took place on August 25, 2010, with the publication of Silver's first FiveThirtyEight blog article online in The New York Times.[538 42]\n\nOn June 3, 2010, The New York Times and Silver announced that FiveThirtyEight had formed a partnership under which the blog would be hosted by the Times for a period of three years.[36] In legal terms, FiveThirtyEight granted a \"license\" to the Times to publish the blog. The blog would be listed under the \"Politics\" tab of the News section of the Times.[37] FiveThirtyEight would thus be subject to and benefit from editing and technical production by the Times, while FiveThirtyEight would be responsible for creating the content.\n\nSilver received bids from several major media entities before selecting the Times.[37][38] Under terms of the agreement, Silver would also write monthly articles for the print version of both the newspaper and the Sunday magazine.[538 41] Silver did not move his blog to the highest bidder, because he was concerned with maintaining his own voice while gaining the exposure and technical support that a larger media company could provide. \"There's a bit of a Groucho Marx quality to it [Silver has said]. ... You shouldn't want to belong to any media brand that seems desperate to have you as a member, even though they'll probably offer the most cash\".[39]\n\nThe first column of the renamed FiveThirtyEight: Nate Silver's Political Calculus appeared in the Times on August 25, 2010, with the introduction of U.S. Senate election forecasts. At the same time, Silver published a brief history of the blog.[538 43] All columns from the original FiveThirtyEight were also archived for public access.[40]\n\nShortly after FiveThirtyEight relocated to The New York Times, Silver introduced his prediction models for the 2010 elections to the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives, and state Governorships. Each of these models relied initially on a combination of electoral history, demographics, and polling. The 538 model had forecast a net pickup of 8 seats by the Republicans in the Senate and 55 seats in the House, close to the actual outcome of a pickup of 6 seats in the Senate and 63 seats in the House.[538 44]\n\nWriters [ edit ]\n\nWhen the transition to The New York Times was announced, Silver listed his staff of writers for the first time.[40] However, of the seven listed writers, only three of them had published on 538/New York Times by late December 2010: Silver, Renard Sexton and Hale Stewart. Andrew Gelman contributed again in early 2011.[538 45] Brian McCabe published his first article in January 2011.[538 46][c]\n\nBeginning in 2011, one writer who emerged as a regular contributor was Micah Cohen. Cohen provided a periodic \"Reads and Reactions\" column in which he summarized Silver's articles for the previous couple of weeks, as well as reactions to them in the media and other blogs, and suggested some additional readings related to the subject of Silver's columns. Silver identified Cohen as \"my news assistant\".[538 47] Cohen also contributed additional columns on occasion.[538 48]\n\nOn September 12, 2011, Silver introduced another writer: \"FiveThirtyEight extends a hearty welcome to John Sides, a political scientist at George Washington University, who will be writing a series of posts for this site over the next month. Mr. Sides is also the founder of the blog The Monkey Cage, which was named the 2010 Blog of the Year by The Week magazine\".[538 49]\n\nBeyond electoral politics [ edit ]\n\nWhile politics and elections remained the main focus of FiveThirtyEight, the blog also sometimes addressed sports, including the March Madness[538 50][538 51][42] and the 2012 NCAA Men's Basketball tournament selection process,[538 52] the B.C.S. rankings in NCAA college football,[43] the NBA,[538 53][538 54][538 55] and Major League Baseball matters ranging from the 2011 attendance at the New York Mets' Citi Field[538 56] to the historic 2011 collapse of the Boston Red Sox.[538 57] The site has also posted forecasts for the Academy Awards.[44]\n\nIn addition, FiveThirtyEight sometimes turned its attention to other topics, such as the economics of blogging,[538 58] the financial ratings by Standard & Poors,[538 59] economists' tendency to underpredict unemployment levels,[538 60] and the economic impact and media coverage of Hurricane Irene (2011).[538 61][538 62]\n\nAdapted from a FiveThirtyEight October 2011 graph published in The New York Times [ 538 63 ]\n\nFiveThirtyEight published a graph showing different growth curves of the news stories covering Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street protests. Silver pointed out that conflicts with the police caused the sharpest increases in news coverage of the protests[538 63] and assessed the geography of the protests by analyzing news reports of the size and location of events across the United States.[538 64]\n\n2012 U.S. elections [ edit ]\n\nFiveThirtyEight rolled out its 2012 general election forecasting model on June 7, 2012. The model forecast both the popular vote and the Electoral College vote, with the latter being central to the exercise and involving a forecast of each state. In the initial forecast, Barack Obama was estimated to have a 61.8% chance of winning the electoral vote. The website provided maps and statistics about the electoral outcomes in each state as well as nationally. Later posts addressed methodological issues such as the \"house effects\" of different pollsters as well as the validity of telephone surveys that did not call cell phones.[538 65]\n\nOn the morning of November 6, Election Day, Silver's model gave President Obama a 90.9% chance of winning a majority of the electoral votes.[538 66] The 538 model correctly predicted the winner of all 50 states and the District of Columbia.[45][d] Silver, along with at least two academic-based analysts who aggregated polls from multiple pollsters, thus not only correctly predicted all 50 states, but also all nine \"swing states\".[46] In contrast, individual pollsters were less successful. For example, Rasmussen Reports \"missed on six of its nine swing-state polls\".[47]\n\nAn independent analysis of Silver's state-by-state projections, assessing whether the percentages of votes that the candidates actually received fell within the \"margin of error\" of Silver's forecasts, found that \"48 out of 50 states actually fell within his margin of error, giving him a success rate of 96%. And assuming that his projected margin of error figures represent 95 percent confidence intervals, which it is likely they did, Silver performed just about exactly as well as he would expect to over 50 trials. Wizard, indeed\".[48][49] Additional tests of the accuracy of the electoral vote predictions were published by other researchers.[50][51]\n\nESPN and ABC News affiliation [ edit ]\n\nIn July 2013, it was revealed that Silver and his FiveThirtyEight blog would depart The New York Times and join ESPN.[52] In its announcement of its acquisition of FiveThirtyEight, ESPN reported that \"Silver will serve as the editor-in-chief of the site and will build a team of journalists, editors, analysts and contributors in the coming months. Much like Grantland, which ESPN launched in 2011, the site will retain an independent brand sensibility and editorial point-of-view, while interfacing with other websites in the ESPN and Disney families. The site will return to its original URL, www.FiveThirtyEight.com.\"[53]\n\nAccording to Silver, the focus of FiveThirtyEight in its ESPN phase would broaden: \"People also think it's going to be a sports site with a little politics thrown in, or it's going to be a politics site with sports thrown in. ... But we take our science and economics and lifestyle coverage very seriously. ... It's a data journalism site. Politics is one topic that sometimes data journalism is good at covering. It's certainly good with presidential elections. But we don't really see politics as how the site is going to grow\".[54]\n\nFiveThirtyEight launched its ESPN webpage on March 17, 2014. The lead story by Silver explained that \"FiveThirtyEight is a data journalism organization. ... We've expanded our staff from two full-time journalists to 20 and counting. Few of them will focus on politics exclusively; instead, our coverage will span five major subject areas \u2013 politics, economics, science, life and sports. Our team also has a broad set of skills and experience in methods that fall under the rubric of data journalism. These include statistical analysis, but also data visualization, computer programming and data-literate reporting. So in addition to written stories, we'll have interactive graphics and features\".[538 67] FiveThirtyEight launched its ESPN-affiliated stage on March 17, 2014. As of July, it had a staff of 20 writers, editors, data visualization specialists, and others.[538 68] By March 2016, this staff had nearly doubled to 37 listed on the masthead, and 7 listed as contributors.[55] The site produced articles under 5 headings: politics, economics, science and health, (cultural) life, and sports. In addition to feature articles it produced podcasts on a range of subjects.\n\nMonthly traffic to the site grew steadily from about 2.8 million unique visitors in April 2014 to 10.7 million unique visitors in January 2016.[56]\n\n2014 U.S. elections [ edit ]\n\nOn September 3, 2014, FiveThirtyEight introduced its forecasts for each of the 36 U.S. Senate elections being contested that year.[538 69] At that time, the Republican Party was given a 64 percent chance of holding a majority of the seats in the Senate after the election. However, Silver also remarked, \"An equally important theme is the high degree of uncertainty around that outcome. A large number of states remain competitive, and Democrats could easily retain the Senate\".[538 70] About two weeks later, the forecast showed the Republican chances of holding the majority down to 55 percent.[538 71]\n\n2016 Oscars predictions [ edit ]\n\nFiveThirtyEight sought to apply its mathematical models to the Oscars, and produced internal predictions regarding the subject, predicting four out of six categories correctly.[57] The website also compiled a list of other predictions made by other people using different methods.[58]\n\n2016 U.S. elections [ edit ]\n\nPresidential primary elections [ edit ]\n\nFiveThirtyEight applied two separate models to forecast the 2016 presidential primary elections \u2013 polls-only and polls-plus models. The polls-only model relied only on polls from a particular state, while the polls-plus model was based on state polls, national polls and endorsements. For each contest, FiveThirtyEight produced probability distributions and average expected vote shares according to both models.[59]\n\nAs early as June 2015, FiveThirtyEight argued that Donald Trump \"isn't a real candidate\".[60] When Donald Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee in May 2016, New York Times media columnist Jim Rutenberg wrote that \"predictions can have consequences\" and criticized FiveThirtyEight for underestimating Trump's chances. He argued that by giving \"Mr. Trump a 2 percent chance at the nomination despite strong polls in his favor ... they also arguably sapped the journalistic will to scour his record as aggressively as those of his supposedly more serious rivals\".[61]\n\nIn a long retrospective, \"How I Acted Like a Pundit and Screwed up on Donald Trump\", published in May 2016 after Trump had become the likely nominee, Silver reviewed how he had erred in evaluating Trump's chances early in the primary campaign. Silver wrote, \"The big mistake is a curious one for a website that focuses on statistics. Unlike virtually every other forecast we publish at FiveThirtyEight \u2013 including the primary and caucus projections I just mentioned \u2013 our early estimates of Trump's chances weren't based on a statistical model. Instead, they were what we [call] 'subjective odds' \u2013 which is to say, educated guesses. In other words, we were basically acting like pundits, but attaching numbers to our estimates. And we succumbed to some of the same biases that pundits often suffer, such as not changing our minds quickly enough in the face of new evidence. Without a model as a fortification, we found ourselves rambling around the countryside like all the other pundit-barbarians, randomly setting fire to things\".[62]\n\nOn the Democratic side, FiveThirtyEight argued that Senator Bernie Sanders could \"lose everywhere else after Iowa and New Hampshire\"[63] and that the \"Democratic establishment would rush in to squash\" him if he does not.[64] Sanders went on to win 23 states in the primaries.\n\nFairness and Accuracy in Reporting, a progressive nonprofit media watch group, wrote in May 2016 that FiveThirtyEight \"sacrificed its integrity to go after Sanders\" and that they have \"at times gone beyond the realm of punditry into the realm of hackery \u2013 that is, not just treating their own opinions as though they were objective data, but spinning the data so that it conforms to their opinions.\"[65]\n\nFiveThirtyEight's predictions for each state primary, both for the Republican and the Democratic party nominations, were based on statistical analysis, not on the analyst's opinions. The core data employed were polls, which FiveThirtyEight aggregated for each state (while also considering national polls) using essentially the same method it had employed since 2008. In the 2016 primaries, the projections also took into account endorsements.[66] The website also kept track of the accumulation of national party convention delegates.[67] In a comparison of prediction success published by Bloomberg News after the primary season was completed, FiveThirtyEight's prediction success tied for the highest percentage of correct primary poll winners, at 92%; but it lagged behind PredictWise in predicting a larger set of primaries.[68] Notably, even with FiveThirtyEight's track record of correctly predicting elections that pollsters get wrong, it still missed Bernie Sanders's upset victory in the Michigan primary, for instance, regarded as \"one of the biggest upsets in modern political history\".[65]\n\nPresidential general election [ edit ]\n\nThe final prediction by FiveThirtyEight on the morning of election day (November 8, 2016) had Hillary Clinton with a 71% chance to win the 2016 United States presidential election,[69] while other major forecasters had predicted Clinton to win with at least an 85% to 99% probability.[70][71] FiveThirtyEight's model pointed to the possibility of an Electoral College-popular vote split widening in final weeks based on both Clinton's small lead in general polls, but also on Trump's improvement in swing states like Florida or Pennsylvania, mixed with Clinton's poor performance in several of those swing states in comparison with Obama's performance in 2012.[72] The main issues pointed out by the forecast model was the imbalance of Clinton's improvement in very populated states like Texas, Georgia (projected safe for Republican) and California (projected safe for Democrats);[72] mixed with her inability to attract white voters without a college degree, an increasing demographic in swing states, in addition to a potential decline in turnout from minorities.[73] In consequence, Clinton's probabilities to win the Electoral College were not improving.[72] Silver also focused on state-by-state numbers in so-called 'must-win' states like Ohio and Florida, plus a consideration of polls' margin of error in advantages of less than three points.[74]\n\nDonald Trump won the election. FiveThirtyEight projected a much higher probability of Donald Trump winning the presidency than other pollsters,[70] a projection which was criticized by Ryan Grim of the Huffington Post as \"unskewing\" too much in favor of Trump.[75] While FiveThirtyEight expressed that \"nonetheless, Clinton is probably going to win, and she could win by a big margin\", the forecaster also made points about the uncertainty of poll trackers in some cases, the considerable number of undecided voters, and the unpredictable outcome in traditional swing states.[76]\n\nIn April 2018, it was announced that FiveThirtyEight would be transferred to ABC News from ESPN, Inc., majority owned by The Walt Disney Company.[77] ABC News Live streaming channel was launched on Roku in May 2019.[78] With the reorganization creating the Walt Disney Direct-to-Consumer and International segment in March 2018, ABC News Digital and Live Streaming (websites, ABC News Live and FiveThirtyEight) was transferred to the new segment.[79]\n\n2020 U.S. elections [ edit ]\n\nRedesign of forecast [ edit ]\n\nIn early August 2020, FiveThirtyEight announced that for their 2020 general election forecast they had designed a new graphical structure. This included going with modular structure, a \"ball swarm\" design for the chart depicting each candidate's chances, and the addition of a \"forecast mascot\" named Fivey Fox.[538 72] An episode of \"Chart Chat\" discussing the design described the direction saying \"FiveThirtyEight has leaned heavily towards a cutesy and engaging approach. The Fivey Fox mascot pops up next to most charts with call-outs to more further information.\"[80]\n\nFivey Fox would also issue reminders to readers of \"the potential for extreme outcomes\" according to Jessica Hullman, in a piece written for The Hill. Hullman also said of the design that the introduction of the mascot, in conjunction with the new simplified look of the page, was \"perhaps the strongest indicator that Silver intends to emphasize uncertainty\" in his coverage of the 2020 election.[81]\n\nJasmine Mithani, visual journalist with FiveThirtyEight, said in an interview when asked about the complaints of new mascot said \"I think the biggest complaint about Fivey Fox is that some people find it infantilizing, but that wasn't our intention\" and that the motivation for including the character was to help make the forecast more of \"a teaching tool\".[82] In November 2020, Rolling Stone reported that Fivey Fox had reached over 7,000 followers on his dedicated Twitter account.[83]\n\nThe forecast favored the actual winner of 48 states, the District of Columbia, and four of the five congressional districts awarding electoral votes, only missing Florida, North Carolina, and Maine's 2nd congressional district. In those three contests the forecast had favored Biden, but they were carried by Trump. Despite correctly forecasting Biden to win nationally, they overestimated Biden's margins in some battleground states such as Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania and underestimated Trump's margins in states such as Ohio, Iowa and Texas. Their forecast showed Democrats winning Senate races in North Carolina and Maine, which Republicans ended up winning. However, their forecast did correctly predict that the Democrats would take control of the Senate. In the House elections, their forecast favored Democrats to gain seats, yet Democrats suffered a net loss of 10 seats. The actual house results fell outside their 80% confidence interval, with Democrats winning 222 seats, lower than the confidence interval's lower bound of 225.[84]\n\n2023 cost-cutting and 2024 elections [ edit ]\n\nIn January 2023, The Daily Beast reported that the website was on the \"chopping block\" amid cost-cutting measures by ABC News, and a sale of the website was being considered. It also noted that several key employees including managing editor Micah Cohen, politics editor Sarah E. Frostenson and sports editor Sara Ziegler had left the website and their positions had not been filled.[85] An ABC spokesperson responded to the report, asserting \"no imminent decisions about [its] relationship with FiveThirtyEight.\"[86] Nonetheless, in April, Silver announced that he would be leaving the site amid widespread layoffs at ABC News, who said the website would be \"streamlined\" ahead of the 2024 election cycle; editor Chadwick Matlin was among the many laid off.[87] According to Silver, two thirds of FiveThirtyEight's staff were cut in one day.[88] Since the layoffs, FiveThirtyEight's sports and science coverage has ground to a halt, with the website mostly returning to its roots of exclusive politics coverage.[89][90]\n\nIn May 2023, ABC News hired G. Elliott Morris, a data journalist for The Economist who has often been described as a rival of Silver,[91] to head the site as editorial director of data analytics.[92] At 538, Morris developed a new election forecasting model of the 2024 election. In the leadup to Biden's withdrawal, 538 was the only professional election forecaster to give Biden majority odds of winning the 2024 election.[93] Silver criticized Morris's model, describing it as at best ignoring the polls and giving Biden positive odds merely due to his incumbency, and at worst as being \"buggy\".[93][94] The election forecast remained suspended for a month after Biden withdrew, before being replaced by a new model for Kamala Harris versus Trump that put more emphasis on polling.[95]\n\nRecognition and awards [ edit ]\n\nMascot [ edit ]\n\nFivey Fox is the mascot of FiveThirtyEight.[538 72] This is in reference to a phrase attributed to Archilochus: \"The fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing\".[538 67] The name \"Fivey\" is a reference to the website's name, FiveThirtyEight.

        "text": "Joe Biden drops out of election, upending race for White House\nBiden ends re-election bid, upending White House race\n\nWatch: Biden\u2019s disastrous few weeks... in 90 seconds\n\nUS President Joe Biden has ended his re-election campaign and endorsed Vice-President Kamala Harris to succeed him as the Democratic candidate, in an extraordinary decision that upends an already dramatic race for the White House. Mr Biden, 81, said in a Sunday written statement that it was the \"greatest honour\" to serve but his withdrawal was \"in the best interest of my party and the country\". The announcement caps a tumultuous period in US politics, which began with his sometimes incoherent debate performance against Donald Trump on 27 June. Mr Biden says he will remain president until January. Ms Harris, 59, said that she was \"honoured\" to be endorsed, adding she would \"earn and win this nomination\" and unite the country against Trump. \"We have 107 days until election day,\" she said. \"Together, we will fight. And together, we will win.\" While Ms Harris has been picking up endorsements from many big figures in the party, she is yet to be officially nominated, and that may not happen until the Democratic National Convention in August. A resurgent Trump meanwhile has pulled ahead in polling and was confirmed as Republican nominee at the party's convention in Milwaukee this week, five days after surviving an assassination attempt. In the wake of Mr Biden's decision, he declared the president \"was not fit to run... and is certainly not fit to serve\". Other senior Republicans joined him in their criticism, and called on Mr Biden to leave the White House immediately, not just the Democratic candidacy. LIVE UPDATES: Joe Biden withdraws from US presidential race\n\nPotential Harris rivals fall in line\n\nSources told the BBC that even senior White House staff and campaign officials were told of Mr Biden's decision only moments before the statement was released on Sunday afternoon, although the president had spoken to Ms Harris and a handful of others beforehand. Dozens of senior Democrats and grandees including former president Barack Obama, Senate leader Chuck Schumer and former House speaker Nancy Pelosi immediately praised the decision and lauded Mr Biden's accomplishments in office. Former president Bill Clinton and 2016 Democratic candidate for president Hillary Clinton said they backed Kamala Harris as the party's candidate for November's vote, saying they would \"fight with everything we've got to elect her\". While Mr Obama stated that he had \"extraordinary confidence\" that an \"outstanding nominee emerges\", he did not explicitly back Ms Harris or any other candidate. Ms Pelosi has not commented. Peter Welch, the first Democratic senator to call on Biden to drop his re-election run, called for an \"open process\" to nominate Harris. But there are already signs that many in the party will unify behind her, including from high-profile politicians who had been touted as potential rivals for the nomination in the event Mr Biden stepped aside. California Governor Gavin Newsom, who is believed to have presidential ambitions, praised Mr Biden as \"selfless\" and said he backed the \"fearless\" and \"tenacious\" Ms Harris to face Trump. Josh Shapiro, the Pennsylvania governor, said he would do \"everything I can to help elect Kamala Harris as the 47th President of the United States\". Pete Buttigieg, the current transport secretary and a former presidential contender, said Mr Biden was \"one of the most consequential presidents in American history\", adding he would do \"all that I can to help elect Kamala Harris the next President.\" Gretchen Whitmer, the governor of Michigan, stated that her job \"will remain the same... doing everything I can to elect Democrats and stop Donald Trump.\" The Democratic National Committee meanwhile filed to amend the names of its fundraising committees to the Harris Victory Fund and Harris Action Fund. Two major Democratic donors - LinkedIn co-funder Reid Hoffman and investor Alexander Soros - publicly endorsed Harris. And within an hour of Mr Biden's announcement, the pro-Trump super-PAC campaign fund Make America Great Again posted an advert attacking Ms Harris, claiming \"she covered up Joe's obvious mental decline\". Trump added: \"Whoever the Left puts up now will just be more of the same.\"\n\nGetty Images Biden and Trump at the 27 June debate\n\nWeeks of intense scrutiny",

Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year. Democrats \u2014 it's time to come together and beat Trump. Let's do this.\"\n\nHarris issued a statement on Sunday saying she is \"honored to have the President's endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination.\"\n\n\"Over the past year, I have traveled across the country, talking with Americans about the clear choice in this momentous election,\" Harris said. \"And that is what I will continue to do in the days and weeks ahead. I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party\u2014and unite our nation\u2014to defeat Donald Trump and his extreme Project 2025 agenda. We have 107 days until Election Day. Together, we will fight. And together, we will win.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden waves to the crowd at an appearance in Las Vegas on July 16, 2024. KENT NISHIMURA/AFP via Getty Images\n\nHarris also paid tribue to Mr. Biden, calling his decision to step aside for the 2024 race a \"selfless and patriotic act.\"\n\nTrump reaction\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, who was officially nominated by the Republican Party on Thursday night, told CNN after the decision that Mr. Biden is the \"worst president by far in the history of our country,\" but he said that he thought if Harris is the nominee, she would be easier to beat than Mr. Biden.\n\nTrump told CBS News' Robert Costa in a phone conversation that Mr. Biden's decision is a \"shock,\" but also said it is good for the country. Costa said Trump believes Mr. Biden was pressured out of the race, and it is a \"total shock to the country to have a president forced out by his own party,\" Costa said, describing Trump's view of the developments.\n\nBut Trump would not commit to debating Harris, telling Costa he is not sure Harris will be the nominee and Trump is waiting to see how the Democratic race shakes out.\n\nLater Sunday evening, Trump posted on Truth Social that his campaign had been \"forced to spend time and money\" running against Mr. Biden but \"now we have to start all over again.\"\n\n\"Shouldn't the Republican Party be reimbursed for fraud in that everybody around Joe, including his doctors and the Fake News Media, knew he was not capable of running for, or being, President?\" Trump wrote.\n\nWhat comes next for Democrats\n\nDNC chair Jaime Harrison said Sunday afternoon that \"in the coming days, the Party will undertake a transparent and orderly process to move forward as a united Democratic Party with a candidate who can defeat Donald Trump in November.\"\n\n\"This process will be governed by established rules and procedures of the Party. Our delegates are prepared to take seriously their responsibility in swiftly delivering a candidate to the American people,\" Harrison said.\n\nDNC executive committee member Alan Clendenin of Florida told CBS News on Sunday that he expects a \"supermajority\" of delegates to coalesce around Harris in the coming days.\n\n\"The delegates at the convention are the ones who place our candidate on the ballot,\" Clendenin said. \"If Biden was still on the ticket, that was going to be process.\"\n\nNever before has a sitting president and presumptive nominee dropped out of the race so late in the process, and Mr. Biden's decision to do so underscores the severity of the crisis that enveloped his campaign after his disastrous debate performance against Trump.\n\nIn the days following the debate, a growing chorus of Democrats openly expressed concern over the president's health and mental state, his ability to defeat Trump in November and his capacity to lead the country for four more years. The pressure to step aside steadily increased as Democratic lawmakers and governors went days without hearing from Mr. Biden directly, allowing questions about his future to swirl within the party ranks. And a growing number of Democrats on Capitol Hill publicly called for him to step aside.\n\nIn the weeks since the debate, the president tried to push back, insisting in a series of public appearances and meetings with Democratic elected officials that he was committed to staying in the race. \"I'm not going anywhere,\" he vowed. But even longtime allies began to urge him to change course.\n\nThe pressure eventually became insurmountable, with top Democrats in Congress telling Mr. Biden that he should step aside and allow a replacement to face off against Trump in November.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris laugh as they view the fireworks on the National Mall from the White House balcony on July 4, 2024. Samuel Corum / Getty Images\n\nMr. Biden is the first sitting president who is eligible for reelection to decline to run again since President Lyndon Johnson stepped aside the spring before the 1968 election. Johnson's vice president, Hubert Humphrey, won the Democratic nomination that year and lost to Richard Nixon.\n\nOnly a handful of first-term presidents in American history have not sought a second term, the last being Rutherford B. Hayes, who declined to run again in the 1880 election. James Buchanan and James Polk also chose not to seek the presidency a second time. Calvin Coolidge, who assumed the presidency in 1923 after the death of Warren Harding, won his own term in 1924 and declined to seek another full term four years later.\n\nBiden family reaction\n\nMembers of Mr. Biden's family publicly reacted Sunday to Mr. Biden's decision, with first lady Jill Biden reposting Mr. Biden's statement on social media with a heart emoji.\n\nHis granddaughter Naomi Biden posted shortly after his announcement that she is \"nothing but proud of my Pop, our President, Joe Biden, who has served our country with every bit of his soul and with unmatched distinction.\"\n\nNaomi Biden's father, Mr. Biden's son Hunter, said in statement posted by Naomi on social media that he has always looked at his father with \"awe.\"\n\n\"How could he suffer so much heartache and yet give so much of whatever remained of his heart to others?\" Hunter said. \"Not only in the policies he passed, but in the individual lives he's touched.\"\n\nHunter added \"thank you, Mr. President. I love you, Dad.\"\n\nMr. Biden's brother, Frank, told ABC News that his brother's decision to step out of the race \"boils down\" to his \"overall health and vitality\" but also \"beating this genuine threat to our nation in the form of Donald Trump.\" Frank Biden also told CBS News that \"selfishly I will have him back to enjoy whatever time we have left in our lives.\"\n\nBut a source familiar with the Biden family pushed back against Frank's statement, telling CBS News \"Frank Biden suffers from alcoholism and hasn't spoken to his brother, the President, in weeks. What he said about President Biden's health being a factor in his decision is completely untrue.\"\n\nA disastrous debate\n\nFor months, the Biden campaign and allies reassured the public that the president was up to the rigors of leading the free world, often dismissing questions about his age and fitness even as polls consistently showed Americans had concerns. Mr. Biden would be 86 at the end of a second term.\n\nBut on the night of the debate on June 27, over 50 million Americans watched the president, lacking his teleprompter and without notes, struggle not only to refute Trump, but to articulate his own policies. Mr. Biden, never the most eloquent speaker, repeatedly lost his train of thought and confused his answers, at one point saying his administration \"beat Medicare.\"\n\nThe flubs baffled members of his own party, many of whom soon recognized the political peril of having Mr. Biden at the top of the ticket if the overwhelming majority of voters considered him not fit to serve.\n\nBefore winning the White House in 2020, Mr. Biden called himself a \"bridge\" to a new \"generation of leaders,\" causing many to wonder if he would only serve one term. In the aftermath of the debate, he explained that his thinking had changed, and the divisiveness in the country led him to believe only he could defeat Trump.\n\nAfter days of his campaign and other allies trying to contain the fallout, the dam had broken, and the president faced pressure from a growing number of Democrats on Capitol Hill to step aside and let a new nominee step up to the plate. He resisted that pressure for more than a week, defiantly and publicly stating that he would not drop his reelection bid. But he continued to misspeak in interviews and speeches, doing little to allay concerns about his ability to win in November.\n\nCalls for him to step aside died down in the aftermath of the failed assassination attempt of Trump on July 13. But behind the scenes, Democratic leaders in Congress were reportedly urging him to make his exit, and polls showed large majorities of Democratic voters saying they preferred a different nominee. News of that private pressure campaign began to break on July 17, coinciding with a call from powerful Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff for Mr. Biden to drop out.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee also pushed back a virtual vote that would have cemented Mr. Biden's status as the nominee, saying on July 17 that plans for a quick resolution would be pushed back until August. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries were said to have encouraged the party's rules committee to delay the vote.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nStates have already held their primaries, meaning Democratic voters have no time or mechanism to pick a replacement directly. At this point in the process, it's up to Democratic delegates \u2014 state and local party officials who were selected during the primaries \u2014 to decide who will replace Mr. Biden at the top of the ticket, either at August's Democratic National Convention in Chicago or beforehand. However it ultimately happens will be a logistical nightmare for Democrats in the weeks ahead.\n\nThe convention is scheduled to begin Aug. 19 in Chicago.\n\nThe party affirmed Friday it would hold a virtual roll call between Aug. 1-7 to formally select a nominee to ensure access to the ballot in Ohio. amid a dispute about the state's ballot certification deadline. Whether that happens now that Mr. Biden has dropped out remains to be seen.\n\n\u2013Ed O'Keefe and Aaron Navarro contributed to this report.",

Mr Biden says he will remain president until January.\n\nMs Harris, 59, said that she was \"honoured\" to be endorsed, adding she would \"earn and win this nomination\" and unite the country against Trump.\n\n\"We have 107 days until election day,\" she said. \"Together, we will fight. And together, we will win.\"\n\nWhile Ms Harris has been picking up endorsements from many big figures in the party, she is yet to be officially nominated, and that may not happen until the Democratic National Convention in August.\n\nA resurgent Trump meanwhile has pulled ahead in polling and was confirmed as Republican nominee at the party's convention in Milwaukee this week, five days after surviving an assassination attempt.\n\nIn the wake of Mr Biden's decision, he declared the president \"was not fit to run... and is certainly not fit to serve\". Other senior Republicans joined him in their criticism, and called on Mr Biden to leave the White House immediately, not just the Democratic candidacy.",

        "text": "2024 United States presidential election in Utah\nThe 2024 United States presidential election in Utah took place on Tuesday, November 5, 2024, as part of the 2024 United States presidential election in which all 50 states plus the District of Columbia will participate. Utah voters chose electors to represent them in the Electoral College via a popular vote. The state of Utah has six electoral votes in the Electoral College, following reapportionment due to the 2020 United States census in which the state neither gained nor lost a seat.[1]\n\nIncumbent Democratic president Joe Biden initially ran for reelection to a second term, but dropped out of the race prior to the Democratic National Convention.[2] Former President Donald Trump ran for reelection to a second non-consecutive term after losing to Biden in 2020.[3] Robert F. Kennedy Jr. gathered the required signatures to qualify for the ballot in early-January but would later withdraw.[4]\n\nA Mountain West state, Utah has not been won by a Democratic presidential candidate since Lyndon B. Johnson in his 1964 landslide and is a strongly red state, a trait vastly owed to the state's conservative Mormon base. As expected, Donald Trump won the state handily\u2014though with only a 1.1% Republican swing, Utah proved to have one of the smallest rightward shifts in the nation.[5] Trump became the first Republican to win the White House without carrying Grand County since William McKinley in 1900.\n\nPrimary elections [ edit ]\n\nDemocratic primary [ edit ]\n\nThe Utah Democratic primary was held on Super Tuesday, March 5, 2024. Incumbent president Joe Biden easily won the state, facing minor opposition from activist Marianne Williamson and Congressman Dean Phillips.\n\nPopular vote share by county Biden 70\u201380%\n\n80\u201390%\n\n>90%\n\nUtah Democratic primary, March 5, 2024 [ 6 ] Candidate Votes Percentage Actual delegate count Pledged Unpledged Total Joe Biden (incumbent) 58,872 86.9% 30 Marianne Williamson 3,521 5.2% Dean Phillips 3,024 4.5% Gabriel Cornejo 1,503 2.2% Frankie Lozada 859 1.3% Total: 67,779 100% 34 34\n\nRepublican primary [ edit ]\n\nThe Utah Republican caucuses were held on Super Tuesday, March 5, 2024. Former president Donald Trump defeated former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley in one of his weakest performances of the greater Republican primaries. The state GOP returned to organizing a caucus after its use of the primary system in 2020, which significantly lowered turnout.\n\nPopular vote share by county Trump 50\u201360%\n\n60\u201370%\n\n70\u201380%\n\n80\u201390%\n\n>90% Haley 50\u201360%\n\nUtah Republican caucus, March 5, 2024 [ 7 ] Candidate Votes Percentage Actual delegate count Bound Unbound Total Donald Trump 48,350 56.35% 40 40 Nikki Haley 36,621 42.68% Ryan Binkley (withdrawn) 826 0.96% Total: 85,797 100.00% 40 40\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral election [ edit ]\n\nPredictions [ edit ]\n\nAs of August 2024, the following candidates have been designated as \"Election Candidates\":[18]\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. lawsuit [ edit ]\n\nOn December 5, 2023, independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. filed a lawsuit against lieutenant governor Deidre Henderson and state elections director Ryan Cowley, arguing that the state's requirement for unaffiliated candidates to attain 1,000 verified signatures before the January 8 deadline is unconstitutional and that it forces Kennedy's campaign to hire professional petition circulators. In the 2020 election, the filing deadline was August 17, and was moved up in a bill passed by the Utah State Legislature in February 2022. Campaign lawyer Paul Rossi argued that the deadline was made \"to block any third-party candidates from appearing on Utah's ballot,\" showing \"an absolute contempt for the Constitution.\"[19] A court filing was made by state attorney general Sean Reyes on December 7, stating that Henderson and Cowley have agreed to not enforce the deadline until March 5, 2024, per request of senior judge David Nuffer.[20] Kennedy later qualified to appear on the Utah ballot on December 28, 2023, marking the first state to award him official ballot access.[21] Kennedy would later withdraw from the ballot in Utah after the suspension of his campaign and endorse Donald Trump for President.[18]\n\nPolling [ edit ]\n\nDonald Trump vs. Kamala Harris\n\nDonald Trump vs. Kamala Harris vs. Cornel West vs. Jill Stein vs. Chase Oliver\n\nResults [ edit ]\n\n2024 United States presidential election in Utah [ 33 ] Party Candidate Votes % Total votes 1,488,469 100.00%\n\nBy county [ edit ]\n\nSwing by county: Democratic \u2014 +2.5-5% Democratic \u2014 +0-2.5% Republican \u2014 +0-2.5% Republican \u2014 +2.5-5% Republican \u2014 +5-7.5% Republican \u2014 +7.5-10% Republican \u2014 +10-12.5%\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nNotes [ edit ]\n\nPartisan clients",

        "text": "Kamala Harris wants to be U.S. president. Her mixed record might make it an uphill battle\nHours after Joe Biden made the stunning decision to end his bid for re-election, U.S. Vice-President Kamala Harris \u2014 with Biden's endorsement \u2014 announced that she is running for president in the 2024 general election against Donald Trump.\n\nHarris, a former prosecutor and California senator who first ran for president in 2020 before she was picked as Biden's running mate, said she was \"honoured to have the president's endorsement.\"\n\n\"My intention is to earn and win this nomination,\" she wrote in a statement.\n\nHarris is not guaranteed the nomination until she is voted in by delegates during the Democratic National Convention next month in Chicago.\n\nDuring a White House event honouring college athletes on Monday, Harris made her first public appearance since Biden's endorsement, calling his presidential legacy \"unmatched in modern history.\"\n\nWATCH | Harris praises Biden's legacy at White House event: Kamala Harris: Biden's legacy is \u2018unmatched\u2019 Duration 0:42 U.S. Vice-President Kamala Harris delivered remarks for the first time since President Joe Biden stepped down from the presidential race at an event for the National Collegiate Athletics Association. Harris said Biden\u2019s legacy is \u2018unmatched in modern history.\u2019\n\n\"Every day, our president, Joe Biden, fights for the American people, and we are deeply, deeply grateful for his service to our nation,\" Harris said, though she did not specifically refer to her own campaign.\n\nIf elected, Harris's presidency would be historic, making her the first woman, first Black woman and first South Asian to serve as president.\n\nShe's led the Biden administration's response on key issues, including immigration, voting rights and abortion.\n\nBut she has an uphill battle ahead, having struggled with public image issues and poor polling throughout her vice-presidency.\n\nWhat she achieved, how she was criticized\n\nHarris, the daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants, first ran for president in 2020 after serving in the U.S. Senate and as attorney general of California. Her presidential campaign faltered early due to low polling and messaging issues, leading her to drop out of the race before the primaries began.\n\nThose issues bled into her first year as vice-president, amid a growing perception that she had been cast aside by the Biden administration that year \u2014 to the point that White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre released a statement stressing that Harris was a \"vital partner\" to Biden.\n\nHarris was further challenged by early turnover among her staff. The Washington Post called it an \"exodus,\" and a Politico investigation found that aides and senior officials were \"experiencing low morale, porous lines of communication and diminished trust.\"\n\nWATCH | How will Harris handle Trump \u2014 and vice-versa?: Joe Biden endorses Kamala Harris. How would she fare against Donald Trump? Duration 18:45 U.S. President Joe Biden has thrown his support behind Vice-President Kamala Harris after ending his re-election campaign on Sunday. Political science professor Chris Galdieri reacts to Biden\u2019s backing of Harris, while Republican strategist Chip Felkel looks at how she stacks up against Trump.\n\nEarly into her tenure, Harris was appointed by the Biden administration to lead its immigration response at the southern U.S.-Mexico border and was tasked with exploring the root cause of mass migration from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.\n\nOne of her most significant achievements came when she secured $4.2 billion US in private-sector investments for job creation and economic development in Central America.\n\nThe initiative was meant to quell the flow of migrants out of those countries and into the U.S., and the administration has said that it's on track to reach its goals in the region.\n\nWATCH | Who should be her running mate? Democrats face 'headwinds' in Midwest Duration 2:20 Kamala Harris should pick a centrist running mate who can help her overcome some of the 'significant headwinds' that Democrats face in battleground states, most notably in the Midwest, says Democratic strategist Brett Bruen. The party must win back voters 'who are sitting in the middle, sitting on the fence,' he said.\n\nPoliticians on both sides of the aisle criticized Harris for delaying a trip to the Mexican border, and conservatives called her a failed \"border czar\" who had dropped the ball as the humanitarian crisis at the border intensified.\n\nAnother key issue in Harris's vice-presidential portfolio is abortion rights, for which she became an especially outspoken advocate after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022.\n\nAt the beginning of this year, she launched a \"fight for reproductive freedoms\" tour pushing for further access to abortion across the country, while mobilizing voters on abortion issues ahead of the election.\n\nHarris has also been outspoken on lowering prescription drug costs and promoting gun reform, and has led efforts to legislate voting rights protections. A legislative victory on the latter file was ultimately stalled when two Senate Democrats withheld their support.\n\nHarris, shown at Nashville's Fisk University in April 2023, would make history if elected as the first woman, first Black woman and first South Asian to serve as U.S. president. (George Walker IV/The Associated Press)\n\nSome polling has shown Harris might be a stronger matchup against Trump, the Republican candidate, than Biden was. Another poll has shown that most Democrats think she would make a good president, with about six in 10 saying they believe Harris would do a good job as president. Two in 10 say they don't believe she would, and another two in 10 said they don't know enough to respond.\n\nIn that same poll, there was broader skepticism among Americans regardless of party. Only three in 10 U.S. adults said Harris would do well in the top job. Her favourability rating is similar to Biden's, but the share of voters who have an unfavourable opinion of her is lower.\n\nThe poll of 1,253 adults was conducted July 11-15, 2024, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.8 percentage points.\n\nA growing chorus of support, an influx of cash\n\nHarris has been endorsed by a majority of Democrats in Congress and by most Democratic governors, including, as of Monday afternoon, former House speaker Nancy Pelosi, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine.\n\nShe has also received endorsements from the Congressional Black Caucus, the Latino Victory Fund and the Human Rights Campaign, as well as from former U.S. president Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, a former secretary of state.\n\nNotably, former president Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, have not endorsed Harris. Obama similarly held off on endorsing Biden during his 2020 election run, doing so only after Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders dropped out of the race for the Democratic nomination.\n\nAs endorsements rolled in, Harris's announcement was met with an influx of cash from Democratic donors. The New York Times reported on Monday that in less than 24 hours, she had raised more than $50 million US while ActBlue \u2014 a donation portal used by the Democrats \u2014 had processed more than $80 million after Biden's announcement that he would step down.\n\nPolls suggests Harris might be stronger than U.S. President Joe Biden in an election campaign against former U.S. president Donald Trump, right. (LM Otero, Evan Vucci/The Associated Press)\n\nA lot of Democrats are increasingly realizing \"that Vice-President Kamala Harris is probably the simplest and most straightforward alternative to Biden,\" said Chris Galdieri, a political science professor at Saint Anselm College in New Hampshire. \"It's literally her job to step in if Biden is not able to do the job.\"\n\nThere is also the question of who her running mate will be, assuming that she is the nominee. While Harris might appeal to Black and female voters, she will have less of a hold on important swing voter states like Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\n\nShe'll likely choose a candidate who can move the needle in regions where the Democrats are struggling.\n\n\"Will it be somebody who can appeal to those Midwestern industrial states?\" Galdieri said.\n\n\"Will she look for somebody who can help Democrats in the southwest, where they've made inroads into places like Nevada and Arizona in the last few years? Or will she go for somebody who can help in the south?\"\n\nWATCH | Kamala Harris's little-known ties to Montreal: Kamala Harris keeps quiet about Canadian ties Duration 2:00 U.S. vice-presidential candidate Kamala Harris has significant ties to Canada, but it\u2019s not something she talks about much. Her mother brought Harris and her sister to Montreal in the 1970s, and she even graduated from Westmount High School.\n\nHaving spent four years working in the White House, Harris is probably best suited to articulate the case for the Biden administration's record and argue that she can continue their work in another term, he said.\n\nBiden's support had been lagging among Black voters, who have shown less enthusiasm for him during this campaign than they had during his initial 2020 run. Harris, by contrast, polls favourably among Black voters and will likely prove more popular among female voters, Galdieri said.\n\n\"I think for the Democrats to pass over the first woman vice-president, the first Black woman to serve as vice-president, would provoke a major rift with Black voters, particularly Black women who have become such an important bedrock constituency for the Democratic Party in recent years.\"",

We just have to remember we are the United States of America.\"\n\nFirst Lady Jill Biden, whose loyalty to her husband has been unswerving, responded by sharing his statement on X with a simple heart emoji.\n\nMs Harris, who many are touting as the frontrunner to replace Mr Biden, said she was \"honoured\" to have the president's endorsement, adding \"my intention is to earn and win this nomination\".\n\nShe thanked Mr Biden for his \"extraordinary leadership\" and for making a \"selfless and patriotic act\" by stepping aside.\n\nShe said: \"I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party - and unite our nation - to defeat Donald Trump and his extreme Project 2025 agenda.\n\n\"We have 107 days until Election Day.

        "text": "What Kamala Harris\u2019s historic bid for the US presidency means for science\nUS President Joe Biden has endorsed vice-president Kamala Harris to take his place in the November election.Credit: Andrew Harnik/Getty\n\nAfter US President Joe Biden ended his re-election campaign on Sunday, he and other senior Democratic politicians threw their support behind current vice-president Kamala Harris. Although the situation could change between now and the official selection of the Democratic candidate for the presidency in August, she is widely expected to face off against former president Donald Trump in the election this November.\n\nHere, Nature talks to policy analysts and researchers about what a potential Harris administration might mean for science, health and the environment.\n\nA background in science and justice\n\nHealth and science have been a part of Harris\u2019s life since an early age: her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, whom Harris cites as a major influence, was a leading breast-cancer researcher who died of cancer.\n\nMuch of Harris\u2019s career has centred on criminal justice \u2014 she served as the district attorney for San Francisco in California from 2004 to 2011 and state attorney general for six years until 2017. She then became a US senator for California.\n\nAs senator, Harris co-sponsored efforts to improve the diversity of the science, technology, engineering and medicine (STEM) workforce. She introduced legislation to aid students from under-represented populations in obtaining jobs and work experience in STEM fields. And in the race for the Democratic nomination for the 2020 presidential election, she proposed a plan to invest US$60 billion to fund historically Black universities and to bolster Black-owned businesses.\n\nAs vice-president, Harris has been chair of the National Space Council, which advises the president on US space policy and strategy. Under her leadership, the body has focused on international cooperation \u2014 for example, with the Artemis mission, which aims to send astronauts to the Moon.\n\nIt is unclear whom Harris will choose to be her running mate if she receives the party nomination. One contender is Mark Kelly, a Democratic US senator for Arizona and former astronaut with decades of experience in science and engineering.\n\nHealth care and drug pricing\n\nDuring the 2020 Democratic primary race, Harris was to Biden\u2019s left on health-care policy. For one, she endorsed a universal single-payer national health insurance system, although she left room for a role for private insurance companies. Biden preferred tweaking the existing system, which he had helped to engineer through the 2010 Affordable Care Act as vice-president under Barack Obama.\n\nNature 632, 15-16 (2024)\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-02394-6\n\nRelated Articles\n\nSubjects",

Who will face Trump?\nVP Kamala Harris is expected to be the new nominee\n\n\u2b50\ufe0fHERE\u2019S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW\u2b50\ufe0f\n\nJoe Biden has pulled out of the 2024 U.S. presidential race.\n\nThe news comes after weeks of Democrats calling for him to step down after a \u2018disastrous\u2019 debate performance in June.\n\nBiden and many other Democrats have endorsed Vice-President Kamala Harris as the new nominee.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s still possible that someone else could be the Democrats\u2019 new candidate.\n\nRead on to find out more. \u2b07\ufe0f \u2b07\ufe0f \u2b07\ufe0f\n\nWith less than four months until the 2024 U.S. presidential election, one of the likely candidates has thrown in the towel.\n\nOn July 21, U.S. President Joe Biden announced he\u2019d be pulling out of the race, and endorsed Vice-President Kamala Harris as the new candidate.\n\nThe announcement comes after weeks of calls for Biden to step down following what the Associated Press and others have called a \u201cdisastrous\u201d debate performance in late June.\n\n\u201cWhile it has been my intention to seek re-election, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President,\u201d said Biden in a letter posted to X, formerly Twitter.\n\nDespite Biden\u2019s endorsement, there is no guarantee that Harris will be the Democrats\u2019 new candidate in what both parties describe as the most important presidential election in generations.\n\nMany Democrats called on Biden to step down after his shaky debate with Trump in late June. (Image credit: CBC)\n\nWhat led to this?\n\nAlthough Biden has not said exactly why he stepped down, the announcement follows weeks of Democrats calling him unfit to run after his June 27 debate with Donald Trump.\n\nIn that debate, Biden often trailed off, was difficult to understand, and failed to call out many of Trump\u2019s lies.\n\nHowever, other Democrats wanted him to stay on, warning that it was too late in the campaign to switch candidates.\n\nA party\u2019s expected nominee has never stepped down this close to an election, according to the Associated Press. The election is on Nov. 5.\n\nKamala Harris endorsement\n\nJust 30 minutes after stepping down, Biden endorsed Harris as the new nominee.\n\nIn a statement, Harris praised Biden\u2019s \u201cselfless and patriotic act\u201d and said she hopes to earn her party\u2019s nomination.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden is throwing his support behind Vice-President Kamala Harris. (Image credit: Matt Kelley/The Associated Press)\n\nIn order to be the Democrats\u2019 official candidate, Harris has to win the most votes from party members called \u201cdelegates\u201d at the Democratic National Convention, which starts on Aug. 19.\n\nFormer U.S. President Bill Clinton and other leading Democrats also rallied behind Harris following Biden\u2019s endorsement.\n\nBut not everyone was quick to pledge their support \u2014 former U.S. president Barack Obama praised Biden for stepping down, but stopped short of a Harris endorsement.\n\n\u201cI have extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nOther Democrats could still pop up in the coming weeks to run for the party\u2019s nomination.\n\nBut Harris has a big advantage: as Biden\u2019s running mate in the election, she\u2019s the only candidate who is allowed to access his campaign funds, according to federal campaign finance rules.\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nBiden said he\u2019ll address the public later this week to give more details about his resignation from the race.\n\nDemocrats don\u2019t have much time to convince voters that their new nominee can beat Trump in November.\n\nBut the Trump campaign will also have to do some scrambling \u2014 after years of developing a campaign strategy focused on Biden as their opponent, they will have to figure out a new approach to a new opponent heading into voting day.\n\n\ufeff\ufeffHave more questions? \ufeffWant to tell us how we're doing?

Moments after his announcement, speculation started running wild over who would be Harris\u2019 running mate, with some Democrats pushing the names of their picks around.\n\nAs of now Harris has only said she will be running for President but has not said anything about who would be her running mate.\n\nBefore the name of Harris\u2019 running mate is announced, let\u2019s take a look at some of the front-runners.\n\nAlso Read Union Cabinet to soon decide on Rs 100 CR credit guarantee scheme for MSMEs: Finance Minister Fifth column by Tavleen Singh: Socialist prince vs real princes Susie Wiles \u2013 All you need to know about first woman to serve as White House Chief of Staff US Elections 2024: What are the swing states? Take a look at who is ahead right now\n\nKentucky Governor Andy Beshear\n\nAccording to Politico, 46-year-old Beshear is one of the front-runners. Coming from Kentucky political royalty, he was elected governor in 2019 and won reelection last November.\n\nAfter Biden\u2019s announcement, he wrote on X, \u201cWhile his decision today could not have been easy, it is in the best interest of our country, and our party. I want to thank him for his leadership, kindness, and for a successful presidency that got big, important things done.\u201d\n\nArizona Senator Mark Kelly\n\nNext up is Arizona Senator Mark Kelly. The 60-year-old has served as a senator since 2020 and is a former NASA astronaut and a Navy combat pilot. Four years ago, he defeated incumbent Republican Martha McSally in the special election for former Sen. John McCain\u2019s seat, becoming the first Democrat to hold the seat since 1962. He then won reelection with ease two years later.\n\nMichigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer\n\nGretchen Whitmer, 52, has been Michigan\u2019s Governor since 2019. Before that, she served in both the Michigan House of Representatives and the Michigan Senate. Her decisive victory in the 2022 gubernatorial race, where she won by nearly 11 points in a battleground state, has positioned her as a potential successor in 2028.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom\n\nThree years younger to Harris, Gavin Newsom, 56, was the mayor of San Francisco when she was the city\u2019s district attorney. They were both elected to statewide office in 2010, with her becoming attorney general and Newsom becoming lieutenant governor.\n\nPennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro\n\nJosh Shapiro, 51, has served as the Governor since 2023. A former Attorney General, he pushed back against Trump\u2019s claims that the 2020 election was rigged. In his 2022 run, he garnered relatively high support from Republicans compared to other Democrats and continues to maintain decent approval ratings across party lines, NBC News said.",

        "text": "The impact of election stress: Is political anxiety harming your health?\nOn the surface, basic strategies for regulating emotions can work to reduce stress about politics. Ford and her colleagues found that after the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton voters who reframed their negative thoughts about the election outcome using cognitive reappraisal techniques had better emotional well-being (Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Vol. 117, No. 5, 2019).\n\nBut the benefits came at a cost because those respondents were also less motivated to take political action. A follow-up study replicated the results, finding that emotion regulation strategies (including distraction and reframing) improved well-being but reduced political engagement (Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Vol. 125, No. 1, 2023).\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a trade-off between reducing negative emotions about politics, which is a perfectly reasonable goal, and the motivation to be politically active,\u201d Ford said.\n\nThose findings beg the question: \u201cIs there a way of regulating the negative emotions politics triggers so politics doesn\u2019t impair our well-being, but at the same time, doesn\u2019t decrease our motivation to take action?\u201d said psychologist Matthew Feinberg, PhD, an associate professor of organizational behavior at the University of Toronto and a collaborator of Ford\u2019s.\n\nThe team\u2019s latest research is exploring whether the positive emotions politics can evoke\u2014things like admiration, compassion, inspiration, and gratitude\u2014can be used to motivate voters to action without raising their stress levels. So far, the study is yielding promising results.\n\n\u201cJust as negative emotions help drive us to take action, so too do our positive emotions,\u201d Ford said. \u201cThese kinds of socially engaged emotional experiences appear to help push people to get involved, but with less cost to their well-being.\u201d\n\nThose results are echoed by recent reports. The election may be a source of stress for more U.S. adults this year, but they also plan to volunteer and contribute more to causes they value, according to APA\u2019s Stress in America survey. Fifty-one percent of adults planned to do so, compared to 45% prior to the 2020 presidential election.\n\nSocial connection clearly makes a difference, but some social ties are more helpful than others, according to research on partisanship by Costas Panagopoulos, PhD, a professor of political science at Northeastern University in Boston, and his colleagues.\n\nIn polarized communities, they found that bonding ties, or bonds between people who are similar (in this case, politically similar), were linked with better physical and mental health (International Political Science Review, Vol. 75, No. 3, 2022). Bridging ties\u2014connections with dissimilar people\u2014were associated with worse overall health for people who were politically isolated.\n\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re worried, we have an instinct to isolate ourselves, but we have to reach out and connect,\u201d said Steven Stosny, PhD, a clinical psychologist, consultant, and author based in Washington, D.C., who works with individuals and couples experiencing stress around politics and daily news.",

What happens next?\n\nGetty Images\n\nPresident Joe Biden has dropped out of the US election race and announced his support for Vice-President Kamala Harris as the Democratic Party's nominee. The decision threw the party into uncharted waters, although Ms Harris appears to have quickly gained the support necessary to become the party's official candidate for president. But nothing is yet set in stone, including the question of who she might pick as an election running mate.\n\nIs Biden still the US president?\n\nYes, he has only ended his campaign to be re-elected to the White House on 5 November. He has pledged to remain president until his successor is formally inaugurated in January. However, Mr Biden faces calls from senior Republicans to step down now.\n\nIs Kamala Harris now the Democrats\u2019 presidential candidate?\n\nIt was not guaranteed that Ms Harris would simply take Mr Biden's place as the Democrats' nominee for president, despite having his backing. However, she now appears to have an unassailable level of support within her party. Her backers include other leading figures who might have mounted a challenge for the nomination and, crucially, from party delegates. Delegates are people selected to represent their electoral area at the Democratic National Convention (DNC), the party's key nominating event, which starts on 19 August. After Mr Biden announced he was dropping out of the race for the White House, hundreds of delegates whose support he had won switched to Ms Harris. A tally by the Associated Press said she passed the required number of 1,976 the next day. Their pledges of support are non-binding until the DNC, but their votes are unlikely to change. The situation triggered by Mr Biden's decision is unusual. The last time an incumbent US president abandoned their campaign for re-election was Lyndon Baines Johnson in 1968.\n\nCould other candidates come forward and how will the nominee be confirmed?\n\nAs calls grew for Mr Biden to drop out of the race, a number of potential replacements emerged. But no serious contender has mounted a challenge against Ms Harris. Something strengthening the VP's hand is the fact that a number of Mr Biden's rumoured replacements have rallied behind her. They include Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, California Governor Gavin Newsom, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro. Ms Harris could either be confirmed by a procedural vote at the convention or in a virtual \"roll call\" run by the party ahead of the gathering. The Associated Press has reported that this could happen 12 days before the convention. Or, in the increasingly unlikely event that the Democratic Party does not unite behind a single candidate, we could see an open convention for the first time in decades. Delegates would be free to decide who to vote for among multiple candidates. Candidates would need signatures from at least 300 delegates - no more than 50 coming from one state - for their name to appear on the ballot. There would be an initial round of voting among the 3,900 pledged delegates, which includes voters deemed loyal to the Democratic Party. If no candidate received a majority of votes after this first round, then more rounds of voting would take place. These rounds would include superdelegates, party leaders and elected officials, who would all cast ballots until a nominee is chosen.\n\nHow does the winning candidate make their VP pick?\n\nThis tends to be a less formal process than the choice of presidential nominee, with the person selected by the nominee generally accepted as their running mate. If Ms Harris does take Mr Biden\u2019s place at the top of the Democratic ticket, some of the names being discussed as her running mate include some of the prominent Democrats now backing her, including Mr Shapiro, and others such as Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Arizona Senator Mark Kelly. Her running mate would become her future vice-president if she wins office.\n\nWhat happens with the money pledged to Biden?",

        "text": "Ask an expert: Harris 2024? Here\u2019s what election and campaign finance laws say\nUNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. \u2014 President Joe Biden announced he is dropping out of the 2024 presidential race, leaving Vice President Kamala Harris the top contender for the Democratic nomination. Biden\u2019s decision not to seek re-election comes after the states held their presidential primaries and his campaign raised tens of millions of dollars.\n\nWhat happens now that the presidential primaries are over, but the winning candidate has decided not to seek office? And if Harris becomes the official nominee, can she use the money that the Biden-Harris campaign raised? Penn State News turned to two experts to discuss the historical precedent and what election and campaign finance laws say about the sudden change to the Democratic ticket.\n\nQ: Has a presidential candidate ever dropped out mid-race in U.S. history?\n\nRobert Speel, associate professor of political science at Penn State Behrend, studies American elections and voting behavior, state and urban politics, Congress and the presidency, public policy and ethnic and racial politics.\n\nSpeel: There were no primary elections prior to the 20th century, so I assume there were presidential candidates who let it be known they would welcome the nomination but dropped out some time before the convention during the 19th century. And even during most of the 20th century, presidential primaries were not that important, held by only 10-15 states, and served only to demonstrate potential candidate popularity to the national convention delegates, who were mostly still chosen by state party leaders at a state convention.\n\nSince the modern presidential primary process began in the 1970s, there has not yet been a presidential candidate who dropped out after winning a majority of delegates in primary elections, so Biden is the first.\n\nIn 1968, when primaries were mostly symbolic, Lyndon B. Johnson (LBJ) had not officially announced yet whether he was running for re-election, but still won the New Hampshire Democratic primary with write-in votes. Yet LBJ finished with under 50% of the vote, due to large support for anti-war candidate Eugene McCarthy, and soon after, LBJ announced that he would not seek re-election that year. The situation with President Biden is very different due to the change in importance of primary elections.\n\nQ: If Vice President Harris becomes the official nominee, could she use the funds raised by the Biden-Harris campaign?\n\nStanley Brand, distinguished fellow in law and government, studies election law, the campaign finance system, the electoral college and the conduct of contested elections. Affiliated with both Dickinson Law and Penn State Law, he also served as general counsel to the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nBrand: There are competing interpretations of federal election law on this question. The Biden re-election committee has already set in motion the transfer of funds to the Harris campaign by filing amended Federal Election Commission (FEC) forms changing the committee name to \u201cHarris for President.\u201d Some Republican lawyers have questioned this, asserting that this can\u2019t be done before the nominating convention, while Democratic lawyers maintain that the committee is for both Biden and Harris and her committee can keep it as long as she is still on the ticket. Normally this could be resolved by either an advisory opinion by or a complaint to the FEC, but that body is split 3-3 Republican to Democrat and so a stalemate is likely. While a lawsuit could be filed there are both timing and jurisdictional issues that might prevent a timely resolution of such a suit. It is an untested issue like so many we have seen in the Trump era.\n\nQ: Now that the presidential primaries are over, how will the Democratic Party choose its nominee? What does election law say about the process?\n\nSpeel: In coming weeks, we will see Kamala Harris choose a vice-presidential candidate. We will see if she chooses a running mate who excites and galvanizes the Democratic base \u2014 and some independents, the way her candidacy has so far \u2014 or if she chooses someone experienced and safe, like Hillary Clinton did with Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia in 2016, and Barack Obama with Biden in 2008, and Michael Dukakis with Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas in 1988. I expect that Republican lawsuits to try to prevent the Democratic National Convention from nominating anyone other than Joe Biden will fail. There is nothing in any law or in the U.S. Constitution regulating how political parties choose candidates, other than campaign contribution limits.\n\nBrand: One other question has been raised by some Republicans about challenging the process involved in endorsing Harris upon Biden\u2019s dropping out. The claim is that voters have been disenfranchised by this switch. This challenge, if made, is unlikely to succeed legally because the voters cast ballots for delegates to the convention who were pledged to Biden but who are \u201cunbound\u201d if the candidate withdraws, allowing them to vote for another person at the convention; and the Supreme Court has held that political parties control the nominating process, and they are entitled to manage how they arrive at a nominee as an incident of their First Amendment associational rights.\n\nFor more information or to speak with one of our election experts, contact mediarelations@psu.edu.",

        "text": "UK readies for new US presidential race\nUK readies for new US presidential race\n\nAnd yet an hour or so later, the president appeared in command at a lengthy news conference.\n\nPresident Biden was barely audible and mumbling - and managed to call Rishi Sunak \u201cMr President.\u201d\n\nThe president and a prime minister half his age, Mr Sunak, sat yards away from each other and from us.\n\nA year ago, I was in the Oval Office of the White House, and I would get to witness it first hand myself.\n\n\"He was really struggling. His mind drifting. He would have moments where he was lucid, but then things would drift off.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll this stuff about the president being too old said by the Trump lot. I never really believed it, but then I heard him,\" this person said.\n\nIt was the best part of a couple of years ago, and a senior government figure was confiding in me about listening in on a call between the then prime minister and President Biden.\n\n\u201cI thought, blimey. It turns out you don\u2019t need to be one of Donald Trump\u2019s megafans to think it.\u201d\n\nBut in recent weeks, things seem to have deteriorated.\n\nThere was the disastrous presidential debate for Joe Biden against Mr Trump.\n\nAnd then that excruciating moment at the Nato summit in Washington.\n\nEvery day in politics, people claim there has been some deeply awkward, embarrassing moment for this politician or another. Most are mildly blush inducing - and almost certainly instantly forgettable.\n\nBut not this one.\n\nWe had just witnessed a jaw dropper, as President Biden managed to introduce President Zelensky of Ukraine, standing next to him, as President Putin.\n\n\u201cThat was quite a thing, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d a different senior UK government figure said to me, with a knowing look. \u201cThat\u2019ll be consequential, without question.\u201d\n\nIt would be mortifying for anyone at any time, but its political danger for President Biden was obvious to us all because it appeared to illustrate a charge he was now finding impossible to escape: that he was simply too old to stand for re-election.\n\nIt was a theme that had dominated Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s first trip to America as prime minister.\n\nI asked him about that moment just after it happened, and had asked him whether the president was senile the day before.\n\nI didn\u2019t use that word lightly.\n\nIt was what an increasing number of people were implying publicly and many had said privately for some time, and the new prime minister was a character witness.\n\nOK, but what was he likely to say on camera about the man in the Oval Office, you might reasonably ask.\n\nFair point, but it is my job to ask nonetheless \u2013 and to pose those difficult, blunt questions.\n\nThey mattered because they relate to the sitting president of the United States.\n\nToday, the prime minister paid tribute to President Biden, saying how defence and security has been \u201ccentral\u201d to his leadership, including by leading \u201cus through the Nato council just 10 days or so ago\u201d, which the PM described as a \u201creally important Nato summit\u201d.\n\nAnd Sir Keir said he looked forward to \u201cworking with him [President Biden] for the remainder of his presidency\".\n\nThere'll be plenty for the two men to discuss and decide in the coming months.\n\nBut the race between Donald Trump and the - as yet unconfirmed - Democrat candidate will be occupying the minds of Westminster strategists and planners now, as they assess what shape the so-called special relationship will take in 2025.\n\nThe nub of it is - the new UK government now knows it will be dealing with a new administration in Washington within six months, whatever happens.",

        "text": "Who could replace Joe Biden as the 2024 Democratic nominee?\nWashington \u2014 The top of the Democratic ticket was suddenly up for grabs after President Biden rocked the political world by announcing Sunday he is dropping out of the 2024 race.\n\nShortly after the announcement, Mr. Biden backed Vice President Kamala Harris for the Democratic nomination \u2014 calling her selection as vice president \"the best decision I've made,\" and offering \"my full support and endorsement\" \u2014 but he does not have the power to choose his replacement. Harris quickly began to consolidate support from Democratic elected officials and party delegates, and by Monday night had secured enough state delegate support to put her on the path to officially securing the nomination.\n\nEarlier, in addition to Harris, a number of other politicians were viewed as possible contenders. But none have said they would challenge her for the nomination, and several, including California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, quickly endorsed Harris. Another prominent Democrat, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, made a point of saying, \"my job in this election will remain the same\" before she endorsed Harris on Monday.\n\nHere is a look at some of those Democratic politicians and potential future candidates. Many of these lawmakers could also be considered front-runners to become the nominee for vice president.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris\n\nHarris, 59, the sitting vice president, received a number of major endorsements in the wake of Mr. Biden's decision to step aside, and for many, she's the natural choice. She's the first female vice president and first vice president of color, and it would be politically difficult for the Democratic Party to deny her the nomination, but she must still win the support of the Democratic delegates. On Monday night, her campaign announced she has secured enough delegates to win when those votes are officially cast, expected in early August.\n\nLike Mr. Biden, Harris has been struggling in polling in the battleground states. CBS News polling recently found that GOP nominee and former President Donald Trump leads Vice President Kamala Harris in a hypothetical matchup. There are at best marginal differences in how she and Mr. Biden currently run among demographic groups, such as younger voters and voters of color.\n\nHarris issued a statement saying she is \"honored\" to have Mr. Biden's endorsement and that her \"intention is to earn and win this nomination.\"\n\nShe said she'd continue to travel the country in the coming weeks and would do everything she could to unite the party and the nation to defeat Trump.\n\nSen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia\n\nA close political aide to Sen. Joe Manchin told CBS News on Sunday that the senator was \"considering\" a presidential bid given the latest developments and the outreach from donors urging him to launch a campaign. Some Democratic donors and officials are reaching out to Manchin to consider standing for the presidential nomination, according to two people familiar with the discussions who were not authorized to discuss private deliberations.\n\nBut in an interview Monday on \"CBS Mornings,\" Manchin said he will not enter the race.\n\n\"I am not going to be a candidate for president,\" Manchin said. He said he would like to see a competitive process to choose the nominee.\n\n\"I think a lot of people would like to see a mini primary,\" Manchin said. \"That's the process \u2014 find out if you have the strongest candidate, whether it could be Kamala or whoever else.\"\n\nEarlier Sunday, before Mr. Biden's announcement, Manchin said in an interview on \"Face the Nation\" that the party had a deep bench and it was time for \"a new generation\" to have \"a chance to rise.\"\n\nManchin, who is 76, left the Democratic Party to become an independent in May, but continues to caucus with the Democrats in the Senate.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom of California\n\nNewsom, the governor of the nation's most populous state, has developed a national profile and often positions himself as the Democratic Party's liberal fighter. Newsom, 56, faced off with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in a debate in December, when DeSantis was still seeking the Republican nomination, in a matchup that was billed as a proxy debate over two visions for the country.\n\nBut Newsom has repeatedly indicated that he had \"sub-zero\" interest in entering the contest, and on Sunday he issued a statement endorsing Harris.\n\nAfter Mr. Biden's announcement, Newsom posted a statement praising Mr. Biden's leadership and calling him a \"history-making president.\"\n\n\"He will go down in history as one of the most impactful and selfless presidents,\" Newsom said.\n\nLater Sunday, Newsom posted a statement in support of Harris. \"Tough. Fearless. Tenacious. With our democracy at stake and our future on the line, no one is better to prosecute the case against Donald Trump's dark vision and guide our country in a healthier direction than America's Vice President, @KamalaHarris,\" Newsom wrote.\n\nGov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan\n\nWhitmer's name has been widely discussed as a possible replacement since the presidential debate, but she said soon after Mr. Biden announced his exit that \"my job in this election will remain the same.\"\n\nShe's a popular governor who won reelection by double digits in 2022, while helping to secure a Democratic trifecta in the state, and she's become a leading voice in the party. Whitmer emphasized abortion rights in her reelection effort, and has pushed Mr. Biden to lean more strongly into the issue this year.\n\nWhitmer issued a statement Monday endorsing Harris, and announced she would co-chair the vice president's campaign.\n\nGov. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois\n\nLongtime Democrat J.B. Pritzker, 59, has been Illinois governor since 2019 and is now in his second term. He's been a strong voice on issues like gun control and reproductive rights. Pritzker is also a billionaire scion of the family that owns the Hyatt hotel chain. His ability to self-fund a last-minute campaign could make him an appealing choice for the party. Like Newsom, his liberal policies in the deep-blue state could be seen as liability for voters during the general election.\n\nPritzker also offered his endorsement of Harris on Monday.\n\nGov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky\n\nBeshear, 46, enjoys rare popularity as a Democrat in a red state. He came out in support of Harris on Monday.\n\n\"I'm excited to fully endorse Vice President Harris,\" Beshear said on MSNBC. \"The vice president is smart and strong, which will make her a good president.\"\n\nThe son of former Gov. Steve Beshear, he overcame GOP dominance in the state last year to win reelection. He's successfully distanced himself from mainstream Democrats, building a political brand that could make him more broadly acceptable than other in Democrats in a general election.\n\nBeshear said after the debate that he would continue to support the president \"so long as he continues to be in the race.\"\n\nGov. Wes Moore of Maryland\n\nMoore is another rising star in the party, and his national profile rose in recent months as he led Maryland's response to the Baltimore bridge collapse. The 45-year-old, who's the youngest Democratic governor in the country and the only Black governor, has been a surrogate for the Biden reelection bid, campaigning around the country.\n\nMoore said earlier that he would not seek seek the Democratic nomination this year should the president leave the race. He endorsed Harris on Monday after having what he described as \"lengthy\" conversations with both the president and vice president.\n\n\"Vice President Harris has the experience, record, vision, and wisdom to unify the country,\" Moore said in a statement. \"President Biden selected her to serve by his side because he knew she could lead the nation. She will have the unique ability to energize the Democratic Party base and mobilize a unique coalition, and we must rally around her and elect her to serve as the next president of the United States.\"\n\nMoore has also been floated as a possible vice-presidential pick, but he said Tuesday on \"CBS Mornings\" that he had \"no interest\" in joining the ticket.\n\n\"I would do anything to make sure that the vice president becomes the next president of the United States\" Moore said.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota\n\nKlobuchar, 64, who ran against Biden and Harris in the 2020 primaries, has been mentioned as a potential candidate who could find a similar base of support as Mr. Biden, but she told CBS News on Sunday that she is endorsing Harris for the 2024 nomination.\n\nShe called Harris \"an incredibly strong leader who will bring to this office, and to this campaign, the receipts,\" Klobuchar said. \"She, along with President Biden, got our nation through this pandemic, we've seen record job increases. She is someone that knows the work, knows the job. And I also know her as a good person.\"\n\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg\n\nButtigieg, 42, has already been vetted on the national stage, after running for president in 2020. The Indiana native has proven he can speak to both Democrats and Republicans \u2014 he's one of the few Biden administration officials who appears on Fox News. Buttigieg and his husband, Chasten, have twins who turn 3 in August.\n\nOn Sunday evening, Buttigieg posted on X, \"I will do all that I can to help elect @KamalaHarris the next President of the United States.\" He called her the right person to \"take up the torch.\"\n\nGov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania\n\nShapiro, 51, gained national attention for besting a far-right opponent in the state's 2022 governor's race, allowing Democrats to hold on to the governor's mansion in a key battleground state. Since then, he has navigated a divided government in the state legislature.\n\nFollowing Mr. Biden's announcement, Shapiro issued a statement endorsing Harris for the nomination.\n\n\"Kamala Harris is a patriot worthy of our support and she will continue the work of generations of Americans who came before us to perfect our union, protect our democracy, and advance real freedom. She has served the country honorably as Vice President and she is ready to be President,\" he wrote.\n\nSen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia\n\nThe senator from Georgia and pastor, 54, won two close races in the Peach State, cementing the Democratic majority in the Senate and becoming a darling of the party in the process.\n\nGov. Jared Polis of Colorado\n\nPolis, 49, has served as Colorado's governor since 2019 and is among the nation's most popular governors. He represented the state's 2nd District in Congress for a decade and also served on the Colorado Board of Education.\n\nHe took the helm of the National Governors Association in July.\n\nGov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina\n\nCooper has been North Carolina's governor since 2017 and is currently serving his second term. He practiced law for nearly two decades and was also in the state House and state Senate before he was elected attorney general in 2000. Cooper, 67, was North Carolina's chief law enforcement officer for four terms.\n\nCooper was campaigning with Harris over the weekend before Mr. Biden dropped out, and he threw his support behind Harris on Sunday night.\n\n\"Kamala Harris should be the next President,\" Cooper posted on social media. \"I've known @VP going back to our days as AGs, and she has what it takes to defeat Donald Trump and lead our country thoughtfully and with integrity. I look forward to campaigning for her as we work to win NC up and down the ticket.\"\n\nHoward Dean, former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, told CNN that he could see Cooper as a running mate for Harris if she becomes the party's presidential nominee. Such a pairing could help Democrats win the Tar Heel state in November, he predicted.\n\n\u2013Robert Costa, Ed O'Keefe and Margaret Brennan contributed reporting.",

        "text": "Elections and the markets: 4 lessons from the past\nThe U.S. political landscape has taken several twists this summer, which likely won\u2019t be the last before the November election. Given the country\u2019s highly polarized political environment and the disparate policy principles, many investors may wonder whether the election\u2019s outcome will affect financial markets \u2014 and whether they should alter their investment strategy accordingly.\n\nThe good news is that while this election may feel different \u2014 they all do at some point \u2014 it\u2019s hard to find evidence that politics is a long-term determinant of market performance. This has held true over the long term as well as over past eight years.\n\nHere are four lessons we can draw from history:\n\n1. Markets don\u2019t favor a party.\n\nDespite the temptation to tie market outcomes to election results, stocks have performed well under both Republican (R) and Democratic (D) presidents. The strongest returns occurred during the F. Roosevelt (D), Clinton (D), Eisenhower (R) and Reagan (R) presidencies.\n\nSince 1930, there have been 23 U.S. presidential elections, with Democratic candidates winning 13 times and Republicans prevailing the remaining 10. The average annualized price return (excluding dividends) of the S&P 500 was 9.6% when a Democrat won and 5.7% when a Republican won. But when looking at longer-term horizons, such as 10 years post-election, results for both parties are similar, with the S&P 500 returning around 7%.1\n\nThe same pattern is observed over the past two administrations. Despite the sizable chasm between Joe Biden\u2019s and Donald Trump\u2019s policies and both experiencing equity bear markets (one caused by the pandemic during the Trump presidency and the other by aggressive Fed tightening during the Biden presidency), stock market returns have been nearly identical. The S&P 500 has returned 14% per year after dividends under each president, highlighting that markets are neither biased toward one party nor exclusively driven by election outcomes.1",

The Associated Press has reported that this could happen 12 days before the convention.\n\nOr, in the increasingly unlikely event that the Democratic Party does not unite behind a single candidate, we could see an open convention for the first time in decades. Delegates would be free to decide who to vote for among multiple candidates.\n\nCandidates would need signatures from at least 300 delegates - no more than 50 coming from one state - for their name to appear on the ballot.\n\nThere would be an initial round of voting among the 3,900 pledged delegates, which includes voters deemed loyal to the Democratic Party.\n\nIf no candidate received a majority of votes after this first round, then more rounds of voting would take place. These rounds would include superdelegates, party leaders and elected officials, who would all cast ballots until a nominee is chosen.",

        "text": "Study: U.S. presidential elections can influence local prosecutor races\nNational politics don\u2019t stay in the federal arena. Instead, they are increasingly filtering down to local races \u2014 including the prosecutor\u2019s office.\n\nHaving the same political party alignment as a successful U.S. presidential candidate gives an incumbent prosecutor a significant edge in re-election, according to recent research by Binghamton University Political Science Professor Jeffrey L. Yates. Local prosecutors are important and powerful actors in the criminal justice system, he pointed out.\n\n\u201cThey have a lot of discretion and impact, especially since the vast majority of dispositions in the criminal justice system are negotiated pleas rather than trial outcomes,\u201d Yates said.\n\nCo-authored by Jamie L. Carson of the University of Georgia, Damon Cann of Utah State University and Ronald F. Wright of Wake Forest University, \u201cThe Increasing Nationalization of Local Elections: The Case of Prosecutors\u201d recently appeared in Political Research Quarterly. The researchers analyzed races from 2012 to 2020 in the nation\u2019s top 200 districts by population.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been interested in criminal justice policy and politics and noticed that there had been almost nothing written on prosecutor elections in political science. In fact, relatively little empirical work had been done on it in any field,\u201d Yates said.\n\nThat prompted a conversation with co-author Wright, who was the first to do empirical work on the topic. They began collecting data, which has led to a number of academic papers, Yates said.\n\nThe United States is the only country in the world in which local prosecutors are elected; 45 states elect their prosecutors, with Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, New Jersey and Rhode Island as the exceptions. However, the researchers noted that this wasn\u2019t always the case; the post was made by appointment until the mid-1800s.\n\n\u201cWhile people want prosecutors to have independence, they also want them to be accountable to the citizenry. The change in the 19th century from appointed to elected prosecutors was part of a broader change in approaches to government in which people wanted more control over government, fewer patronage appointments and more responsive officials,\u201d Yates explained.\n\nThrough the decades, American politics has undergone a steady shift that has narrowed the division between national and local politics, he observed. Tip O\u2019Neill, speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives from 1977 to 1987, popularized the phrase \u201call politics is local,\u201d although the phrase itself is believed to date back much earlier.\n\n\u201cLocal politicians can find themselves \u2014 and their campaigns \u2014 embroiled in national-level issues,\u201d Yates said.\n\nThe researchers found that incumbent prosecutors gain a meaningful advantage if they are the same party as the U.S. president, one that\u2019s not easy for challengers to overcome. Other influences were statistically significant, although smaller when compared to the presidential party boost: Higher crime rates tend to give an advantage to an incumbent, for example, and female incumbents are less likely to win, likely due to the influence of gender stereotypes.\n\nThe nationalization of local elections has a downside. Yates noted that local officials could end up running on issues they don\u2019t actually have the power to directly affect rather than those more pertinent to the local level.\n\nThe researchers are currently working on subsequent papers that take a deeper look into the subject, Yates said.\n\n\u201cWe hope to highlight the relevancy and importance of prosecutor elections,\u201d he added. \u201cThey are powerful officials, and these elections are becoming more salient and competitive.\u201d",

        "text": "Ballots to Bullion: Examining the US Election's Effect on Gold\nA brave new world Given the US's pivotal role in the global economy, coupled with the prevailing geopolitical uncertainties, the upcoming presidential election is viewed by many as a watershed moment with far-reaching implications. As it stands, Republicans led by Donald Trump are ahead in the polls, but the outcome is far from secured. Furthermore, the recent events in the campaign trail \u2013 both the assassination attempt on President Trump and President Biden stepping down from the presidential race \u2013 have increased the level of uncertainty for an already divided US electorate. In this context, investors are asking about the effect of the election on gold. Our analysis suggests that while US gold bar and coin demand seems to increase, on average, during Democratic presidencies, this is not the case with other segments of investment demand. In addition, party affiliation does not have a consistent impact on price during US elections. Instead, economic policies, both domestic and foreign, of any given president are more relevant to the behaviour of financial assets, including gold. And while, historically, the US election has not been seen as a geopolitical risk, both the world and the US electorate remain highly polarised. This in turn highlights the need for robust hedges in investor portfolios, a role that gold fulfils effectively.\n\nHighlights Elections have not, historically, had a significant or immediate effect on gold's performance but regardless of the winning candidate, near-term geopolitical risks remain high and may serve as a catalyst for gold.\n\nThe gold price typically responds to key drivers, such as the direction of the US dollar, interest rates or perceptions of risk, which can be, of course, influenced by economic, fiscal and monetary policies of a specific administration - irrespective of party affiliation.\n\nWhile our analysis is based on long-term historical precedent, the expectations about gold\u2019s performance can also be informed by its observed behaviour during the previous Trump administration and current Biden presidency, assuming a continuation of policies.\n\nChart 1: Polling data currently points to a Republican victory PredictIt polling data for the 2024 US presidential election* Chart 1: Polling data currently points to a Republican victory PredictIt polling data for the 2024 US presidential election* Chart 1: Polling data currently points to a Republican victory PredictIt polling data for the 2024 US presidential election* *As of 22 July 2024. Source: Bloomberg, PredictIt, World Gold Council Sources: Bloomberg, PredictIt, World Gold Council; Disclaimer *As of 22 July 2024.\n\nUS election impact on gold price performance Our analysis suggests that, historically, gold tends to perform below its long-term average in the period around the US presidential election (Chart 2). But this result has not been particularly consistent.1\n\nChart 2: Gold slightly underperforms around elections relative to long-term average Gold\u2019s average long-term performance compared to performance around presidential elections* Chart 2: Gold slightly underperforms around elections relative to long-term average Gold\u2019s average long-term performance compared to performance around presidential elections* Chart 2: Gold slightly underperforms around elections relative to long-term average Gold\u2019s average long-term performance compared to performance around presidential elections* * Time period assesses ranges from 1972-2022. Error bars represent two standard deviations. We note that a Republican win -6M prior displays the strongest return, however this is skewed by the 1972 and 1980 election. If those two data points are removed, the return would be the worst out of the seven scenarios shown above. Source: Bloomberg, World Gold Council Sources: Bloomberg, World Gold Council; Disclaimer * Time period assesses ranges from 1972-2022. Error bars represent two standard deviations. We note that a Republican win -6M prior displays the strongest return, however this is skewed by the 1972 and 1980 election. If those two data points are removed, the return would be the worst out of the seven scenarios shown above.\n\nThere are two opposite trends. Gold appears to do slightly better six months before a Republican president is elected and it remains flat in the period post-election. Conversely, gold tends to underperform before a Democratic president is elected and perform just below its long-term average in the six months post-election. However, none of these results are statistically significant. There are few observations for each of the cases analysed and there is significant variability within the results.2 This may suggest that gold is not responding to the party affiliation of an elected president but, more likely, to the expected effect of specific policies. This is also evidenced by the fact that gold does not consistently outperform during the full term of a president from one party over another. In addition, while our analysis shows that US demand for bars and coins notably increases during Democratic presidencies, this alone is not enough to solely dictate the direction of gold (see Appendix) especially since this result is not replicated in either US gold ETFs flows or positioning in COMEX futures. Overall, our analysis of gold and US presidential elections suggests that gold is not reacting directly to party affiliation or changes in leadership. Rather, it highlights the relevance of key global macroeconomic drivers of gold\u2019s performance in contrast to specific local dynamics.\n\nIs there a crystal ball this time? Notwithstanding gold\u2019s general behaviour during elections, this time we have the added advantage of knowing how gold performed during the previous Trump administration. Even though Biden is now not running for re-election, we can analyse the behaviour of gold under his presidency assuming there will be a continuation of his policies under a new Democratic administration. Gold did well during both Trump and (so far) Biden presidencies through a combination of policy decisions and broader global macroeconomic drivers. Gold rose by 60% during Trump\u2019s presidency - increasing by nearly 30% pre-COVID and slightly over 30% during the pandemic. Under Biden, gold moved sideways initially, but has gained more than 30% during the term so far, primarily due to broader macro factors and central bank buying.\n\nChart 3: COVID-19\u2019s impact on performance Indexed price performance of gold* Chart 3: COVID-19\u2019s impact on performance Indexed price performance of gold* Chart 3: COVID-19\u2019s impact on performance Indexed price performance of gold* *As of 28 June 2024. Source: Bloomberg, World Gold Council Sources: Bloomberg, World Gold Council; Disclaimer *As of 28 June 2024.\n\nUS elections and geopolitical risk Our analysis has previously shown a direct connection between geopolitical risk and gold. We have found that a 100bps rise in the Geopolitical Risk (GPR) Index,3 holding all else constant, has a c.2.5% positive impact on gold\u2019s return. This reinforces the view that gold tends to be perceived by investors as a safe haven during times of elevated geopolitical risk. But what does this mean in relation to a US presidential election? Our analysis yields that, historically, movements in GPR around past US elections have not proven to be a major direct driver of the gold price.4 Instead, we believe this form of risk shows up indirectly, and is subject to a time lag based on the market effect of the policies \u2013 both foreign and domestic \u2013 that a given administration rolls out throughout its term. Similarly, BlackRock\u2019s recent analysis on its internal geopolitical risk dashboard does not rank the upcoming US election as a top 10 geopolitical risk for 2024.5 Nevertheless, geopolitical risks remain high with little chance of a significant decline in the near future.\n\nChart 4: Elevated geopolitical risks likely to remain GPR Index over the past two presidencies* Chart 4: Elevated geopolitical risks likely to remain GPR Index over the past two presidencies* Chart 4: Elevated geopolitical risks likely to remain GPR Index over the past two presidencies* *As of 28 June 2024. Source: Matteo Iacoviello, World Gold Council Sources: Matteo Iacoviello, World Gold Council; Disclaimer *As of 28 June 2024.\n\nFor example, if Trump is elected, he will likely confront a more polarised world than during his previous term. As such, global markets may be more reactive to the direction of his policies \u2013 especially foreign ones. For instance, recent commentary from Trump on NATO may signal continued geopolitical uncertainty. Equally, from a GPR indicator standpoint, risk levels were significantly lower at the beginning of Biden\u2019s presidency, compared to where they are today; they will also likely continue to rise as the election nears regardless of the candidate behind which Democrats rally (Chart 5). And a Democratic presidency with similar policies to Biden's may meet a divided Congress and have difficulty in passing legislation.\n\nChart 5: 2020 is a poor proxy given countries were more focused on fighting the pandemic domestically Results from GRAM around the 2020 US Presidential Election* Chart 5: 2020 is a poor proxy given countries were more focused on fighting the pandemic domestically Results from GRAM around the 2020 US Presidential Election* Chart 5: 2020 is a poor proxy given countries were more focused on fighting the pandemic domestically Results from GRAM around the 2020 US Presidential Election* *Results shown here are based on analysis covering an estimation period from September 2020 to August 2021.

All such event risks could encourage investors to include more hedges, such as gold, in their portfolios and could provide support for gold. Our analysis suggests that the 2016 campaign serves as a suitable proxy for the upcoming election. For example, like 2016, we see a similarly divided electorate for both candidates and a potential shift in the party controlling the White House. Given Trump is currently leading in the polls we can develop a base-case expectation for likely government policy changes post-election (Chart 6). This also presents an opportunity for investors who may be underhedged and underexposed to assets like gold.\n\nChart 6: We view the 2016 election to be a stronger proxy for the upcoming election Results from GRAM around the 2016 US Presidential Election* Chart 6: We view the 2016 election to be a stronger proxy for the upcoming election Results from GRAM around the 2016 US Presidential Election* Chart 6: We view the 2016 election to be a stronger proxy for the upcoming election Results from GRAM around the 2016 US Presidential Election* * Our Gold Return Attribution Model (GRAM) is a multiple regression model of weekly gold price returns, which we group into four key thematic driver categories of gold\u2019s performance: economic expansion, risk & uncertainty, opportunity cost, and momentum.

In relation to the US presidential election\u2019s impact on the gold price, we found gold slightly underperforms around elections relative to its long-term average, albeit not statistically significant. During the six months following the Trump and Biden inaugurations gold returns were roughly -2.6% and -6.4%, respectively. Furthermore, we know that prior elections have not created an immediate impact to geopolitical risk, rather, they have contributed positively or negatively to the broader risk landscape on a lag as administrations roll out policies. And while gold has not reacted, on average, to the outcome of past elections, the outcome of this election may have a more noticeable effect on investor sentiment. A continuation of election-related uncertainty and rising geopolitical threats will add more volatility and likely impact broader macro variables. This, in turn, could drive investors to evaluate how they might mitigate risk in their own portfolios and draw them towards a safe-haven asset like gold.\n\nAppendix US bar and coin demand has doubled with Democrats As a key component of demand, retail bar and coin gold investment is a relevant segment to monitor leading up to the US election. Historical data suggests that the sale of gold coins via the US Mint tends to spike in anticipation of a Democratic victory. For reference, in any given month the average volume of ounces in gold coins sold to authorised purchasers via the US Mint is roughly 60,800 ounces.7 However, during the month of an election in which the Democrats win, this figure has risen on average to 86,400 ounces, compared with 71,000 ounces for Republican victories over the past 37 years. Anecdotal evidence indicates that retail bar and coin buyers may be Republican leaning. This could partially explain the increase in demand around the election, particularly when a Democrat wins. However, this pattern extends beyond the election month. Over the 12 months post a Democratic win, the average monthly volume sold is roughly 79,000 ounces compared to a mere 32,500 ounces observed after a Republican victory (Chart 7).\n\nChart 7: Gold coin mint sales are stronger with a Democrat in office Quarterly volume of Gold Eagle and Gold Buffalo bullion coins sold by the US Mint* Chart 7: Gold coin mint sales are stronger with a Democrat in office Quarterly volume of Gold Eagle and Gold Buffalo bullion coins sold by the US Mint* Chart 7: Gold coin mint sales are stronger with a Democrat in office Quarterly volume of Gold Eagle and Gold Buffalo bullion coins sold by the US Mint* *We acknowledge that Democratic victories have coincided with major economic or market events, and therefore disentangling the effect of a Democratic victory is not straightforward.

Data as of 28 June 2024.\n\nSimilarly, bar and coin demand (the volume of gold bars and coins bought by individuals) tends to surge and remain elevated when a Democrat is in the White House (Chart 8).\n\nChart 8: Physical demand stronger with a Democrat administration in the White House Quarterly US bar & coin demand in tonnes*\n\nWe found that average bar and coin demand during an election quarter equates to roughly 25t for Democratic victories, significantly higher than the 12t for Republican wins over the same period. Looking over the next four quarters, we find that demand when a Democrat has control of the White House averages roughly 26t, compared to just 7t under a Republican administration. These findings suggest that physical gold demand, whether motivated by demographics, political affiliation, or broader economic concerns, tends to increase under a Democratic administration.8 It is important to note, however, that these results do not hold for US gold ETF demand or COMEX futures positioning, nor are their effects - just like we see in the analysis of the gold price - either more short-term or more dependent on macro variables.",

        "text": "Kamala Harris wins enough support to clinch Democratic nomination\nKamala Harris wins enough support to clinch Democratic nomination\n\nKamala Harris: From prosecutor to possible president... in 100 seconds\n\nVice-President Kamala Harris has secured the support of a majority of Democratic delegates to become the party's nominee for president. A survey by the Associated Press on Monday evening said she had received the endorsement of more than the 1,976 delegates needed to win the nomination in the first round of voting. That means Ms Harris is on course to be crowned the party's standard bearer and take on Republican Donald Trump in November's presidential election. It becomes official when party delegates hold a roll call vote ahead of next month's Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Chicago. Delegates are people who are selected to represent their electoral area. Their pledges of support are non-binding until the vote but unlikely to change. No-one has publicly stepped forward to challenge Ms Harris since President Joe Biden left the race on Sunday. He found himself under mounting pressure from senior members of his party following his stumbling debate performance against Trump. If the total holds between now and when delegates cast their votes, scheduled to take place from 1-7 August, Ms Harris would formally clinch the party's nomination.\n\nThe survey by AP is an indication of the groundswell of support for Ms Harris after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race on Sunday. Since Mr Biden's announcement, millions of dollars in donations have poured into her campaign and leading Democrats have lined up to support her bid as the Democratic nominee. Has Harris got what it takes to beats Trump? Harris donations top $100m after Biden exit Ms Harris is due to appear in the key swing state of Wisconsin on Tuesday, at a rally in Milwaukee that marks her first campaign event since Mr Biden made his decision and said he was endorsing his deputy. Meanwhile, Mr Biden will return to the White House after spending a period of time in isolation with a Covid-19 infection. He is due to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this week, during the other leader's visit to Washington. Ms Harris will meet Mr Netanyahu separately, but an aide of the vice-president told the BBC that a previously-scheduled event meant she would be unable to preside over a planned address by Mr Netanyahu to a joint session of Congress.\n\nKamala Harris: 'I know Donald Trump's type'\n\nSpeaking to staff at her campaign's headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware, on Monday evening, Ms Harris had Trump in her sights. Referring to her early career as a prosecutor in California who took on predators and fraudsters, she added: \"I know Donald Trump's type.\" She said the Biden-Harris campaign had always been about two different versions of the future of the country - theirs and Trump's. \"One focuses on the future, the other focuses on the past,\" she said. \"Donald Trump wants to take our country backwards... we believe in a brighter future that makes room for all Americans.\" She also noted Mr Biden's accomplishments, saying her time serving as his vice-president was \"one of the greatest honours of my life\".\n\nBefore Ms Harris took to the stage, Mr Biden made his first comments since dropping out of the 2024 election via phone call while isolating after contracting Covid-19. He thanked aides and told them to \"embrace\" Ms Harris because \"she's the best\". \"I know yesterday's news was surprising and hard for you to hear, but it was the right thing to do,\" Mr Biden told them. He vowed to remain fully engaged in the campaign because democracy was at stake. Meanwhile Trump's new running mate, Senator JD Vance, attacked both Ms Harris and Mr Biden while campaigning in Virginia. \u201cHistory will remember Joe Biden as not just a quitter, which he is, but as one of the worst presidents in the history of the United States of America,\u201d he said. \u201cBut my friends, Kamala Harris is a million times worse and everybody knows it. She signed up for every single one of Joe Biden\u2019s failures, and she lied about his mental capacity to serve as president.\u201d\n\nBiden says leaving 2024 race was 'right thing to do'",

        "text": "Biden says nothing can get in way of saving democracy, including \"personal ambition\"\nAddressing the nation on camera for the first time since announcing his decision not to run for reelection, President Biden said in the Oval Office that saving democracy is more important than any title, and he acknowledged it was time to \"pass the torch\" to a new generation of leaders.\n\nYears ago, Mr. Biden called himself a transitional candidate, and listed Vice President Kamala Harris among the younger generation of leaders he saw as the future of the Democratic Party. Now is the time to make way for those newer, younger voices, he said, like that of Harris, whom he has endorsed for the nomination.\n\nThough he did not mention Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump by name, Mr. Biden has referred to Trump as a threat to democracy.\n\n\"I believe my record as president, my leadership in the world, my vision for America's future, all merited a second term,\" the president said. \"But nothing, nothing, can come in the way of saving our democracy. That includes personal ambition. So, I've decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. That's the best way to unite our nation. You know, there is a time and a place for long years of experience in public life. But there's also a time and a place for new voices, fresh voices, yes, younger voices. And that time and place is now.\"\n\nMr. Biden hinted that he had arrived at the decision to drop out in part because of doubts over whether he could defeat Trump.\n\n\"I revere this office, but I love my country more,\" the president said. \"It's been the honor of my life to serve as your president. But in the defense of democracy, which is at stake, I think it's more important than any title.\"\n\nMr. Biden took a moment to reflect and marvel at where his life had begun, long before his 51-year-long political journey.\n\n\"Nowhere else on earth could a kid with a stutter from modest beginnings in Scranton and Claymont one day sit behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office as president of the United States,\" he said. \"But here I am. That's what's so special about America.\"\n\nThe president expressed his gratitude to the American people, and praised the country as a nation of possibilities.\n\n\"It has been the privilege of my life to serve this nation for over 50 years,\" he said, adding, \"I have given my heart and my soul to so many nation, like so many others. I'm blessed a million times in return with the love and support of the American people. I hope you have some idea of how grateful I am, to all of you.\"\n\nPresident Biden speaks from the Oval Office of the White House on July 24, 2024 about his reasons for abruptly ending his run for a second term. Evan Vucci / Getty Images\n\nFor the remaining six months of his term, Mr. Biden said he plans to focus on the job of the presidency. He plans to continue to try to lower costs for families, defend personal freedoms, protect the right to vote, and fight against cancer. He said he also plans to continue to speak out against gun violence, and call for Supreme Court reform.\n\nAbroad, the president said he would continue to make NATO stronger, support Ukraine's fight for freedom, and work to end the war in Gaza.\n\nAnd Mr. Biden, who ran on the idea that democracy itself was at stake in 2020 and is again in 2024 with Donald Trump as the Republican nominee, reminded Americans that they are the ones who will determine America's destiny: \"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule. The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America \u2013 lies in your hands.\"\n\nThe president also listed what he believes are his greatest achievements, including lowering the racial wealth gap, passing bipartisan infrastructure funding, achieving wins against big Pharma, lowering the cost of prescription drugs, compensating veterans exposed to toxic materials and putting the first African American woman on the Supreme Court.\n\nHundreds of White House staffers remained to watch Mr. Biden's address, and he emerged afterward from the Oval Office to greet them, to huge cheers.\n\nA great team saying thank you to a great President. pic.twitter.com/kXgRaFYhCE \u2014 Herbie Ziskend (@HerbieZiskend46) July 25, 2024\n\nA Trump campaign official confirmed that the GOP nominee also watched the president's speech from his plane after a rally in Charlotte; New York Times photographer Doug Mills snapped a picture.\n\nDemocrats have fallen in line behind Harris, after Mr. Biden endorsed her for the nomination soon after announcing he would end his campaign. Mr. Biden cannot appoint a successor for the Democratic nomination, but since his announcement on Sunday, Harris has secured the endorsements of a majority of Democratic delegates.\n\nThe president has said little since his decision while he recovered from COVID-19 symptoms at his home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. The White House said Tuesday that he had tested negative, and Mr. Biden told reporters upon his return from Delaware that he's feeling \"well.\"\n\nOval Office addresses are rare for a president, including for Mr. Biden. Before last week, Mr. Biden had only delivered two Oval Office addresses in his three-and-a-half years as president. Last week, he delivered his third Oval Office address, following the assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump.\n\nAlthough Mr. Biden plans to participate in the campaign, stepping down from the Democratic ticket allows him to focus on the task of the presidency itself, away from the physically taxing campaign trail.\n\n\"I'm not going anywhere,\" the president told his campaign staff \u2014 who are now Harris's campaign staff \u2014 Monday. \"I'm going to be out there on the campaign with her, with Kamala. I'm going to be working like hell, both as a sitting president, getting legislation passed, as well as \u2014 and campaigning.\"\n\nThis Oval Office address, as well as any speech the president gives next month at the Democratic National Convention, is among the most critical of not just Mr. Biden's presidency, but of his legacy, as he completes more than five decades in public service.\n\n\"In just a few months, the American people will choose the course of America's future,\" the president said from the Oval Office. \"I made my choice. I've made my views known. I would like to thank our great vice president, Kamala Harris. She's experienced, she's tough, she's capable. She's been an incredible partner to me, and a leader for our country. Now the choice is up to you, the American people.\"\n\nNancy Cordes and Nikole Killion contributed to this report.",

        "text": "US election: Kamala Harris says she has enough delegates to secure Democratic Party nomination\nVice president Kamala Harris has secured enough delegates to earn the Democratic Party's nomination as presidential candidate.\n\nIn a statement she said: \"Tonight, I am proud to have secured the broad support needed to become our party's nominee, and as a daughter of California, I am proud that my home state's delegation helped put our campaign over the top. I look forward to formally accepting the nomination soon.\n\n\"I am grateful to President Biden and everyone in the Democratic Party who has already put their faith in me, and I look forward to taking our case directly to the American people.\"\n\nAccording to an Associated Press tally, Ms Harris had 2,214 delegates, well beyond the simple majority needed to clinch the nomination on the first ballot.\n\nThe survey is unofficial, as Democratic delegates are free to vote for the candidate of their choice and she will not be the official candidate until what is known as the roll call is completed, whether virtually or in person at the Democratic Party Convention from 19 August in Chicago.\n\nMs Harris has been working to secure endorsements from a majority of its delegates and if she wins the nomination, she will need to pick a running mate.\n\nMichigan governor Gretchen Whitmer, seen as a possible rival for the Democratic nomination after Mr Biden's exit, has backed Ms Harris in a post on X, saying the vice president had her full support.\n\nSeveral other potential Democratic challengers, including California governor Gavin Newsom and Kentucky governor Andy Beshear, have also supported Ms Harris's bid. Former House speaker Nancy Pelosi has also backed Ms Harris.\n\nHowever, ex-president Barack Obama has not announced who he wants to be the party's nominee.\n\nImage: Joe Biden said he would not be seeking re-election. Pic: AP\n\nBiden makes first comments since quitting race\n\nJoe Biden vowed he is \"going to be working like hell\" in his final months as US president to campaign for Ms Harris to be his successor.\n\nHe was speaking in a phone call to staff at the campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware, in his first public comments since he announced at the weekend he would be quitting the 2024 White House race and endorsing his vice president.\n\nMs Harris also addressed the workers in Delaware, where she hit out at Republican Donald Trump.\n\nThe vice president, 59, is the only declared Democratic candidate so far to be the party's nominee ahead of November's election against 78-year-old Mr Trump.\n\nMr Biden will return to the White House later today from his home in Delaware where he has been recovering from COVID.\n\nThe 81-year-old leader said on Sunday he was no longer standing for re-election after weeks of pressure from within his own party amid concerns about his health and fitness to serve another four years in office.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 2:41 Who is Kamala Harris?\n\nLatest updates: Biden surprises campaign staff with phone call\n\nMr Biden told supporters on Monday: \"I'm not going anywhere. I'm going to be out there on the campaign with her, with Kamala. I'm going to be working like hell. Both as a sitting president, getting legislation passed, as well as campaigning.\"\n\nMr Biden added that even though \"I won't be on the ticket... I'm still going to be fully, fully engaged\".\n\n\"I've got six months left of my presidency, I'm determined to get as much done as I possibly can. Both foreign policy and domestic policy.\"\n\nOn supporting Ms Harris, he said: \"I'll be doing whatever Kamala wants me or needs me to do... We're still fighting in this fight together.\"\n\nHe hit out at Mr Trump, saying he was \"still a danger to the communities, a danger to the nation\".\n\nMs Harris then began by saying \"I love you, Joe\" while the president stayed on the line.\n\nRead more on this story:\n\nWho could challenge Harris in race to replace Biden?\n\nWould Michelle Obama run?\n\nAnalysis: Biden became a liability for Democrats\n\nShe said: \"Over the next 106 days we are going to take our case to the American people and we are going to win.\"\n\nMs Harris said Mr Biden created millions of jobs and \"got the COVID pandemic under control\".\n\nShe also said Mr Biden \"stood up\" for democracy at home and abroad.\n\nDiscussing her time as a state prosecutor, she said she \"took on perpetrators of all kinds\".\n\nShe added: \"I know Donald Trump's type, and in this campaign I will proudly put my record against his.\"\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:32 Biden's legacy 'unmatched in modern history'\n\nMs Harris said: \"Building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency.\"\n\nShe also pledged an \"assault weapons ban\" and said she would fight for \"reproductive freedom\".\n\nEarlier on Monday, at an event for college athletes in the White House grounds, Ms Harris said Mr Biden's legacy of accomplishment was unmatched in modern history.\n\nHe is currently recovering from COVID, with Ms Harris saying he is \"feeling much better\".\n\nHer campaign has said it has raised $81m (\u00a362m) in its first 24 hours.\n\nThe team said the 24-hour figure was the biggest of \"any candidate in history\".\n\nThe $81m is in addition to an existing, almost $250m (\u00a3193m) \"war chest\" which was raised \"across the campaign, Democratic National Committee, and joint fundraising committees\".\n\nSpreaker Spreaker , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

Protection more than one year prior to the general election should only be granted in extraordinary, case by case circumstances in consultation with the committee, based on threat assessment and other factors.\n\nCriteria have been established to assist the DHS Secretary and the advisory committee in their decision making (as of 2017).\n\nWhen determining whether a candidate for the Office of President or Vice President of the United States qualifies as a major candidate, the Secretary has broad discretion and may consider a variety of factors. These factors include, but are not limited to:\n\nWhether the candidate has publicly announced his or her candidacy and has filed the appropriate documentation with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and is in compliance with the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended, and related laws; Whether the candidate is actively campaigning on a national basis for the office for which his or her candidacy has been announced, as demonstrated by operating a national campaign apparatus, regularly appearing at public events in multiple states, producing and publishing campaign advertisements, and other similar indicia of a campaign; A threat assessment conducted by the Secret Service of general or specific threats directed towards the candidate (for these purposes, \u201cthreats\u201d should be defined as explicit threats of bodily harm to the candidate or indications of inappropriate behavior towards the candidate suggesting potential bodily harm); Whether, during and within an active and competitive major party primary, the most recent average of established national polls, as reflected by the Real Clear Politics National Average or similar mechanism, the candidate is polling at 15% or more for 30 consecutive days; Whether the candidate is the formal or de facto nominee of a major party for President or Vice President; Whether the candidate is an independent or third-party candidate for President polling at 20% or more of the Real Clear Politics National Average for 30 consecutive days; Whether the candidate is the Vice Presidential running mate of the above independent or third-party candidate.\n\nTitle 18 U.S.C.' 3056(a)(7) states that the U.S. Secret Service is also authorized to protect spouses of major Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates, as identified by the DHS Secretary, within 120 days of the general Presidential election. Some candidates have received protection earlier in the campaign pursuant to Presidential memoranda.\n\nWhat is the history of candidate/nominee protection?\n\nCandidate and nominee protection was expanded to include major candidates for President and Vice President in 1968:\n\nMajor candidates and their spouses began receiving protection after the assassination of Robert Kennedy in 1968. PL-90-331 was passed June 6, 1968. (Language since adopted into 3056);\n\nPrior to this event, candidates and their families did not receive Secret Service protection;\n\nProtection of a candidate/nominee is designed to maintain the integrity of the democratic process and continuity of Government.\n\nMedia",

        "text": "US economy picks up amid heated presidential campaign\nUS economy picks up amid heated presidential campaign\n\nGetty Images\n\nEconomic growth picked up in the US this spring, raising hopes that the world's largest economy will be able to get inflation under control while avoiding a painful slowdown. The economy expanded at an annual rate of 2.8% over the three months to June, lifted by brisk consumer spending, the Commerce Department said Thursday. The pace was faster than expected, but still marked a slowdown from 2023. The strong figures arrive during a heated presidential campaign, in which voters have regularly named the economy as their top concern.\n\nThe country's steady growth - far outstripping its international peers - would usually typically favour Democrats as the incumbent party. But the current mix of conditions has made for a puzzle. Unemployment, at 4.1%, is low but rising. Growth is solid, but has slowed from the boom that came as the economy reopened after Covid. And though price inflation has significantly subsided, economic discontent remains elevated, as households grapple with a 20% leap in prices since 2021 and high borrowing costs. President Joe Biden's decision to drop out of the race has scrambled the picture further. \"There's a lot of crosscurrents here, in terms of voters thinking about the economy,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. \"At this point, I don't think it's a headwind or a tailwind.\"\n\nForecasters had been predicting growth this quarter of about 2%. But Thursday's figures showed the economy bouncing back from a slowdown at the start of the year, when gross domestic product (GDP) grew just 1.4%. As well as strong consumer spending, the report showed increased business investment and an uptick in exports. In a statement, Mr Biden said the report \"makes clear we now have the strongest economy in the world\". But University of Iowa professor Michael Lewis-Beck, who is known for a model that predicts popular vote outcomes based on economic growth and presidential approval, said growth did not appear to have been strong enough in the first half of this year to overcome Mr Biden's steep unpopularity. His model had predicted a narrow loss for Mr Biden based on the start of the year growth. He warned that Democrats would face even stiffer odds now that the president is off the ballot, as they lose any incumbent advantage. The election remains close and complicated, he added, noting that the three elections since 1948 that his model has been wrong - in 1960, 1968 and 1976 - took place in \"turbulent times\", like today's. \"Not that the economy wasn't relevant in those times, but there were other huge things going on,\" he said, describing the current race as a \"nail biter\".\n\nSome other analysts said they thought Mr Biden's decision to quit the race could make it easier for Democrats to pick the parts of his legacy they want to promote, while separating themselves from negatives such as inflation. \"I see upside with vice president [Kamala] Harris taking over the ticket because she can put distance between herself and President Biden\" on inflation, said Danielle Deiseroth, executive director of the progressive pollster Data for Progress. The administration's signature economic policies - including investments in roads, bridges, advanced technology and clean energy - are otherwise popular, she noted. \"It's an opportunity for a reset on the economic narrative,\" she said.\n\nUntil Mr Biden bowed out, Mr Zandi said he had been \"very uncomfortable\" with the Democratic victory that his firm has been forecasting for the presidential election, using a model that takes into account things like gas prices and unemployment rates. Now, he said he felt better \"sticking with the model\". \"I think it's a game-changer politically,\" he said of Mr Biden's move, while noting that small changes to non-economic factors such as turnout could \"easily\" deliver a win to Trump. \"It's going to be very close,\" he said. \"It's very much on a razor's edge.\"",

        "text": "Howard University Releases Guidance on Political Activity during the Presidential Elections\nAs the upcoming presidential election cycle moves into full swing, Howard University has released mandatory guidance on political activity that all faculty, students, and constituent organizations are required to follow.\n\nDear Howard University Community,\n\nHoward University like all universities, provides a natural forum for political discourse and activity. Moreover, Howard\u2019s commitment to the \u201cdiscovery of solutions to human problems in the United States and throughout the world\u201d is in its mission, and the University\u2019s essence is expressed in its core values of Excellence, Leadership, Service and Truth.\n\nGiven the global attention to the historic potential nomination of Howard University alumna Vice President Kamala Harris (B.A. \u201986) as the Democratic presidential candidate, the Howard University community needs important guidance to avoid any inadvertent attribution of political campaign activity to the University. A violation of the political campaign prohibition, whether intentional or unintentional, could have significant consequences that would jeopardize the financial future of the University. We ask that all members of the University community be aware of the following general guidance, which is taken from the Howard University Policy #800-002 Political Activity Guidance to All Key Stakeholders Policy (PDF). For more information, please review this Howard University policy.\n\nTo protect Howard University\u2019s legacy and its status as a non-profit 501(c)(3) tax-exempt educational institution, it is incumbent upon all students, faculty, staff, and alumni to comply fully with University policies and procedures.\n\nThe most important point to remember is that the University and its constituent organizations are prohibited from engaging in partisan political activity. This includes:\n\nmaking financial contributions to a campaign;\n\nsoliciting campaign contributions (fundraising);\n\ndistributing information or creating websites and links in favor of or in opposition to a certain candidate;\n\nsponsoring events to promote a certain candidate;\n\nengaging in disparate treatment of candidates invited to participate at a University event; and\n\nestablishing political action committees (PACs).\n\nThis policy is not intended in any way to abridge freedom of expression, academic freedoms, or imply that individuals cannot exercise their constitutional political and civic rights. Should you engage in partisan political activity, you must always make it clear that your personal views or opinions do not represent those of Howard University and that your partisan political activities are not sponsored or supported by Howard University in any way.\n\nThe next section includes two (2) disclaimers for your convenience.\n\nDisclaimers: Public Statements (Oral or Written) by Key Stakeholders\n\nKey Stakeholders may not make partisan political statements (oral or written) when speaking as a representative of Howard University, at official Howard University functions, or in official Howard University publications.\n\nPersonal public statements in support of a candidate or political party are permitted where there is a clear indication that comments are entirely personal and do not, and are not intended to, reflect or represent the views of Howard University and an appropriate disclaimer is used.\n\nFor all oral personal public statements regarding a candidate \u2013 the speaker should personally state:\n\n\u201cOpinions expressed are the personal opinions of [Name] and not the opinions of Howard University, a tax-exempt educational institution.\u201d\n\nFor all written personal statements or appearances where an official is referred to by name and title \u2013 the statement should include:\n\n\u201cTitles and affiliations of each individual are provided for identification purposes only. Opinions expressed are the personal opinions of [Name] and not the opinions of Howard University, a tax-exempt educational institution.\u201d\n\nPlease also note that Howard University Resources are not to be used, even when using the Disclaimer. Howard University Resources include, but are not limited to:\n\nHoward University images, campus statuary and landmarks, logos, insignia, or marks. This includes images of the Clock Tower, University seal, Bison logo, and other trademarked intellectual property,\n\nHoward University printed or digital letterheads or stationery,\n\nHoward University building and email addresses,\n\nindoor and outdoor campus spaces, including The Yard, offices, meeting rooms, and so forth,\n\noffice equipment, such as computers, phones, and copiers, and office supplies,\n\nHoward personnel, including administrative staff and other Howard employees,\n\nemail, campus mail, and voicemail systems,\n\nHoward University social media, and other platforms sponsored by the University, such as Zoom and Teams; websites, and blogs. University print and digital publications,\n\nbulk mail privileges and sales tax exemptions,\n\npaper and electronic mailing lists, including directories, listservs, donor rolls and databases,\n\nfood and refreshments.\n\nOutside of the University, individuals can express their own personal opinions and make direct personal contributions to a campaign. Anytime your action might implicate the University, please stop and think about it and consider these rules.\n\nFinally, please take note that any invitations extended to dignitaries must comply with Howard University Policy #400-002 Policy for Inviting Dignitaries to HU.\n\nSince 1867, Howard has fostered leadership to address issues borne from injustice, discrimination, and disparity, to effect positive social, economic, and political change, particularly for African Americans and other people of color, through scholarship and activism.\n\nWe hope that you will join in protecting the important legacy of Howard University by following this important guidance.\n\nThank you.\n\nIn Truth and Service",

Registering to vote and requesting your ballot for the 2024 elections\n\nStarting January 1, 2024, go to votefromabroad.org to fill out your Federal Post Card Application (FPCA) absentee ballot request \u2014 it takes 5-10 minutes! If you're not registered to vote, the FPCA also serves as a voter registration form. Choose the option to receive ballots by email.\n\nYou should fill out an FPCA every election year to ensure you remain on your state\u2019s overseas voter rolls and to ensure your local election office has your up-to-date contact information. It\u2019s important to follow these steps to register as an absentee voter from abroad because the ballots of US citizens voting from abroad have special protections and are different from the standard absentee ballot.\n\nSubmit the FPCA to your local election office in the United States. Most states allow you to submit your FPCA directly from votefromabroad.org without the need to print it out. But some states require that you submit your completed form by email attachment, fax, or postal mail. State deadlines and submission methods can be found here.\n\nIf you have any questions while filling out your request form, email [email protected]. You can also type your question in the chatbox on the website Vote From Abroad (the red circle in the bottom right-hand corner of each screen). Or visit the FAQ section on the website.\n\nWatch a video on how to use www.votefromabroad.org.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Confirming your request has been accepted \u2705\n\nAfter submitting your FPCA absentee ballot request form, call or email your local election official (LEO) to confirm they have received it and will be sending your ballot. Your LEO's contact information is listed in the instructions generated when you fill out your FPCA form at Vote from Abroad. You can also look up their contact info here.\n\nMost states provide a website where you can verify your voter status. To find your state's website, click here and scroll down to \u201cWhere Is My Ballot?\"\n\n3. Receiving your ballot \ud83d\udcec\n\nYour overseas absentee ballot is not your standard absentee ballot back home! Thanks to the MOVE Act, all states must send FPCA-requested absentee ballots to overseas voters no later than 45 days before a federal election. This year that\u2019s September 21, 2024 for the general election; the date varies by state for the primary elections.\n\nAnd, if requested, all states must send overseas voters their ballot by email.\n\nYou don't need to wait for ballots to arrive on September 21. If you're worried your ballot won't arrive on time, send in a Backup Ballot NOW. The Backup Ballot (Federal Write-in Absentee Ballot or FWAB) is specifically for overseas voters who are concerned they won't receive their official ballot in time to return it by the deadline. All details about the Backup Ballot can be found here.\n\n4. Your ballot hasn\u2019t arrived? \ud83d\udced\n\nCheck your spam folder. Still no ballot? Contact your local election official (find their contact info here) and confirm they\u2019ve sent your ballot to you.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t received your ballot by October 1 and your state requires postal mail return, we recommend you send in a Backup Ballot to make sure your vote gets to your state in time. All details about the Backup Ballot can be found here.\n\n5. Voting your ballot \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f\n\nIt\u2019s easy to get informed about candidates, ballot initiatives, and judicial candidates online. It\u2019s important to vote in every race on your ballot. State and local races are critical in 2024!\n\nThe simplest way is to vote for Democrats straight down the ballot. Some elected positions do not list a party affiliation, like school boards, judges, and others. To determine who to vote for in those cases, you can do the following:\n\nGoogle your county's local Democratic Party\n\nGo to the League of Women Voters personalized ballot service\n\nGo to Ballotpedia - Example: google \u201cBallotpedia Arizona elections 2024\u201d\n\nGoogle the candidate's name to find their campaign website\n\n6. Returning your ballot!\n\n\ud83d\udccc Remember! Only use a mail service if you cannot return your ballot electronically \ud83d\udccc\n\nBallot return methods \u2013 by email, online, postal mail, fax \u2013 vary by state. Always return your ballot as quickly as possible, but especially if your state only allows postal mail return. Find your state's exact ballot return methods here.\n\nIf your state allows email, online upload or fax for ballot return, please use these options! They\u2019re not subject to delay. Here is more information on fax submission.\n\nIf your state requires postal mail return, see info below on options from New Zealand. Please allow plenty of time to get your ballot back to the USA!\n\nCheck return times for regular mail services as well as private courier services before using.\n\nNew Jersey Voters: Please note that New Jersey allows for email or fax returns, but requires that the ballot ALSO be sent by postal mail.\n\nNew York Voters: Here are instructions on How to fold the New York State General Election ballot.\n\nNeed help scanning your ballot? Watch this video on how to scan using your smartphone. If you don't have a scanning app on your phone, you can use Adobe Scan mobile app for iPhone & Android\n\n\u27a1 International Postal Service:\n\nIf your state requires postal mail ballot return, you can use international mail from the NZ Post. It is a reliable postal service, but please remember mail service in both NZ and the US can be slow and so you should send your ballot as soon as possible!\n\nWe do not recommend spending the extra money for a tracking number when sending the envelope \u2013 it\u2019s better to confirm receipt by looking on your state\u2019s website, or looking up your local election officer's contact details here. Do NOT send it with a signature required as local elections officers will not sign for it.\n\nAsk for a postmark or date stamp to be placed on the outer envelope. Some states require this, and it is a good practice in general. Find out your state\u2019s requirements here.\n\n\u27a1 Courier Service:\n\nIf your state requires postal mail ballot return, the quickest option is to use a courier service.\n\nCall or email your local election office in the United States to check out the best address to use, and then check out courier solutions. If you use DHL, please note they do not directly deliver to some addresses in the USA, but will get your ballot package to the US and then use US Postal Service to deliver it from there. So do check if that's the case for your local election office, and allow for plenty of time.\n\nEven with expedited courier services, ballots still take several days to get to the United States. Please send your ballot as soon as possible! Do not wait! You should \u2013 and some states require you \u2013 ask for a postmark or date stamp to be placed on the outer envelope. Find out your state\u2019s requirements here. We do not recommend booking or paying online with any courier service. You will not receive a postmark if you book or pay online.\n\n\ud83d\udccc Remember! Only use a mail service if you cannot return your ballot electronically \ud83d\udccc\n\n\u27a1 The U.S. Embassy/Consulate diplomatic pouch:\n\nIt is possible to return your ballot by using the diplomatic pouch mail service at the U.S. Consulate in Auckland, and you can mail or drop-off your ballot. The U.S. Embassy in Wellington also has a drop-box; you'll need to ask the guards for permission to drop off your ballot. Using this process takes at least 4 weeks for your ballot to reach its destination, so please be aware of this. If you are keen to use the diplomatic pouch and would like some assistance, please email [email protected]. If you do choose to use the diplomatic pouch mail service, we recommend that you mail or drop off your envelope no later than October 1.\n\nFor the diplomatic pouch mail service, you will need U.S. postage on the ballot envelope, as it will be delivered into the U.S. mail system after transportation to the US by the diplomatic service. You can use a U.S. postage paid return envelope (sometimes provided with your ballot), or an envelope bearing sufficient U.S. postage. You can download a free U.S. postage-paid ballot return envelope template at FVAP.gov.\n\nAddress for ballot drop-off/mailing/couriering in Auckland: U.S. Consulate General Auckland 3rd Floor, 23 Customs St. East, Auckland CBD 1010.\n\n*If you mail or courier your ballot to the Auckland Consulate, you need to put your ballot in an outside envelope with the Consulate address on it; write \"Attention Voting Officer\" on your outside envelope.\n\n\n\nAddress for ballot drop-off in Wellington: U.S. Embassy, 29 Fitzherbert Terr., Thorndon, Wellington 6011.\n\nPlease see the U.S. Embassy website for more information.\n\n7. Checking twice to prevent mistakes \ud83d\udc40\n\nWhen filling out and packaging your ballot, don't forget to review the instructions carefully. Don't let human error spoil your ballot!\n\nRegardless of how you send in your ballot, remember that you \u2013 the voter \u2013 must be the one who places it \u201cin the mail.\u201d In some states, it is unlawful for any other person to handle your voted ballot, even if it is sealed. Unsure? Find out your state\u2019s requirements here.\n\n8. Confirming your ballot's arrival at your local election office in the United States \u2713\u2713\n\nOnce you've sent your ballot, follow up with your local election official to make sure that it arrived and will be counted. Please do not just assume that your ballot has made it!\n\nThe easiest way to ensure your ballot has arrived is to go to \"Track Your Ballot\" on your state\u2019s website. You can also look up your local election officer's contact details here and contact them directly. They may be experiencing a high volume of calls, so you may need to be persistent to get through to someone.\n\n9. Having trouble?

        "text": "Betting data shows Harris's chances are on the up but Trump is still leading\nAs Joe Biden withdraws from the 2024 US presidential race and Kamala Harris gains support from prominent Democrats, data from Betfair Exchange indicates that her odds are improving.\n\nThe vice president still faces a significant challenge to surpass Donald Trump, however, who has maintained strong performance over nearly the past year.\n\nA day before Mr Biden dropped out of the presidential race, he was 57 percentage points behind Mr Trump according to betting odds data from Betfair.\n\nMr Trump's chances of winning were 64%, with Mr Biden on 7% and Ms Harris on 17%.\n\nAt the start of the 2024 Republican National Convention, just days after Mr Trump's assassination attempt, his chances stood at 69%.\n\nAfter Mr Biden dropped out of the race on Sunday, Mr Trump's chances of winning had fallen to 62%.\n\nAs Mr Biden endorsed Ms Harris on Sunday, her chances rose by six percentage points to 23% and as more endorsements come in from top Democrats today her chances have gone up to 29%, the highest recorded for the current vice president but still 33 percentage points behind Mr Trump.\n\nInterestingly, Ms Harris's chances of winning were higher than both Mr Biden and Mr Trump in 2021.\n\nMr Biden's numerous gaffes, from introducing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as Vladimir Putin, to rambling and mumbling at the first debate of the presidential season, has meant Mr Trump has enjoyed a particularly high lead over the current US president over the past month.\n\nFrom the beginning of July 2024, Mr Trump's lead over Mr Biden according to the bookies has consistently been 40 percentage points or more. From 5 July it's been at least 50 percentage points.\n\nMr Trump has consistently been ahead of Mr Biden since around the time of the current president's impeachment inquiry in September 2023, with the exception of three days in April 2024 where Mr Biden's chances were less than a percentage point more than Mr Trump.\n\nThat period covers the time leading up to Mr Trump's criminal trial, although on 30 May when he was eventually found guilty, he had a lead over Mr Biden of two percentage points.\n\nMr Biden's highest lead over Mr Trump was on 7 June 2023, when he was 18 percentage points ahead.\n\nSeveral of Mr Biden's top leads over Mr Trump occurred in June 2023, around the time indictments were filed against Mr Trump.\n\nOne was submitted on 30 March, another on 8 June, which was dismissed and two more in August which have yet to be decided.\n\nHe was found guilty on all counts of falsifying business records related to the indictment filed on 30 March.\n\nHowever, this did not significantly dent his lead, likely due to growing concerns about Mr Biden's fitness to remain in office, which ultimately led to his withdrawal from the race.\n\nThe Data and Forensics team is a multi-skilled unit dedicated to providing transparent journalism from Sky News.

        "text": "What does the 2024 election mean for the future of AI governance?\nThe viral launch of ChatGPT one month later represented a paradigm shift for broader conversations in Washington. Of 298 bills with relevance for AI governance and usage introduced since the start of the 115th Congress, 183 of them were proposed after ChatGPT\u2019s launch (Figure 1). Despite a flurry of proposals and a series of nine expert AI Insight Forums convened in the Senate (and a subsequent roadmap ), Congress has so far failed to pass comprehensive AI legislation. Instead, the White House has steered AI governance efforts, cutting across a wide range of executive authorities. AI policy is thus particularly vulnerable to change if there is a transition to a second Trump administration in 2025.\n\nIn addition to promoting the development and adoption of AI, the Biden administration\u2019s approach to AI policy has placed more emphasis on risk and harm mitigation. One of its first major governing documents was the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights , a set of values published in October 2022 that, while not legally binding, were intended to help guide the development of safe and responsible AI.\n\nThe Trump administration also engaged in international fora around the development of AI norms. It supported the adoption of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development\u2019s 2019 AI principles, became a founding member of the Global Partnership on AI in 2020, and joined the United Nations\u2019 Conference on Certain Conventional Weapons\u2019 Group of Governmental Experts in unanimously adopting a set of 11 guiding principles on the use of lethal autonomous weapons.\n\nInternationally, the Trump administration\u2019s economic strategy sought to deny adversaries, namely China, from accessing advanced technologies, and export controls became a core feature of the United States\u2019 China policy. In 2019 , Donald Trump\u2019s Department of Commerce (DOC) added Huawei and its affiliates to the Entity List , restricting the sale of goods and services without a license from DOC\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS). In 2020 , BIS also added SMIC , China\u2019s leading state-owned semiconductor foundry, to the list and ruled that no more licenses to export manufacturing equipment used for chips at the 10-nanometer node and below (the kinds used in advanced AI systems) would be approved to counter China\u2019s military modernization efforts.\n\nThough AI had not yet burst into the public conscience during the Trump administration, its policies toward AI governance generally focused on the promotion, development, and adoption of AI systems. In four years, the administration issued two major executive orders. The first established the American AI Initiative which was later codified into law. It set forth five guiding principles, including training American workers, fostering public trust and protecting civil liberties, and engaging internationally. The second outlined principles for the government\u2019s use of AI, directed the Office of Management and Budget to develop guidance for implementing the principles, required agencies to publish inventories of their AI use cases, and added an AI track to the Presidential Innovation Fellows program. Despite a nuanced approach, at the time, some were critical of the Trump administration\u2019s limited attention to risk mitigation.\n\nTwo successive administrations have attempted to address these issues, each with different interests and styles, but with some surprising overlap in objectives and policies. The next president will face major decisions on how to govern increasingly powerful and disruptive AI systems and how to prioritize challenges related to safety, innovation, competition, and risk. If the past is a prelude, the actions of both the Biden and Trump administrations offer some clues as to how the future rules of the road might be written.\n\nAs one of the most transformative technologies ever created, artificial intelligence (AI) is likely to reshape nearly every facet of society. While we are far from seeing AI\u2019s full capabilities, the guardrails put in place now will influence how this technology shapes work and productivity, democracy, war and peace, and much more moving forward.\n\nIn July 2023, the Biden administration developed a set of Voluntary AI Commitments on safety, security, and trustworthiness with a number of leading developers. While these are not legally binding, most frontier model developers have signed on and joined an industry association to guide their implementation. The centerpiece of the Biden administration\u2019s AI policy is its October 2023 executive order, which invokes the Defense Production Act to mandate that developers of advanced AI systems share safety test results with the U.S. government, imposes know-your-customer requirements on cloud service providers, and sets standards for federal agencies on AI safety, security, and privacy. The administration also released a memorandum from the Office of Management and Budget which set forth binding guidelines on AI governance, innovation, and risk mitigation for federal agencies.\n\nBeyond domestic policy, the Biden administration has engaged in AI governance conversations in bilateral and multilateral fora, including cooperation around safe and transparent AI systems through the U.S. and European Union\u2019s Trade and Technology Council, implementation of the G7\u2019s Hiroshima Process to leverage the benefits of AI while guarding against potential harms, and cooperation on safety and evaluation standards between the U.S. AI Safety Institute and an international network of analogous organizations. The United States signed a Statement of Intent to collaborate on AI safety with other countries, committed to ongoing dialogue between the EU AI Office and U.S. AI Safety Institute, and signed a partnership agreement with the United Kingdom\u2019s AI Safety Institute, which recently announced it would open a branch in San Francisco. The United States has also worked with partners on a political declaration on AI in the military and has continued to engage at the U.N.\u2019s Conference on Certain Conventional Weapons\u2019 Group of Governmental Experts.\n\nPerhaps most notably, the Biden administration restarted bilateral dialogues with China on key \u201ctechnical and policy\u201d issues, where the two sides discussed their approaches to AI safety and risk management. Despite this dialogue, the administration not only expanded Trump\u2019s tariffs in some sectors but also oversaw a \u201cseismic shift\u201d to more restrictive export controls on advanced semiconductors and manufacturing equipment. The administration also issued an executive order requiring outbound investment screening for critical emerging technology industries.\n\nLooking forward\n\nThroughout the Biden administration, Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party\u2019s likely nominee for president, has taken a leading role in AI policy efforts. She led the U.S. delegation to the United Kingdom for the Global Summit on AI Safety and facilitated a dialogue with the CEOs of leading AI developers, among other roles. Absent movement in Congress, a Harris administration will continue to be limited to existing executive authorities. It will also likely maintain many of the policies of the previous administration, with the Biden executive order (EO) as a guiding document and a continued focus on risk mitigation and responsible development and investment.\n\nTrump, by contrast, has vowed to rescind the Biden EO \u201con day one\u201d and the Republican Party platform would repeal the EO and replace it with something that supports \u201cAI Development rooted in Free Speech and Human Flourishing.\u201d This aligns with a backlash among conservative researchers, commentators, and policymakers, who have railed against the EO as an abuse of the Defense Production Act that will stifle innovation through unnecessary regulation. The most significant effect of rescinding the EO would be the end of the reporting regime for frontier model developers and cloud service providers. These requirements are one of the only legally binding transparency mechanisms for companies that develop or provide resources for the most powerful, and potentially dangerous, AI systems, and their removal would be a huge blow to the movement for guardrails on frontier AI.\n\nDespite open confrontation with China on emerging technologies and export controls, the Biden administration has engaged in dialogue on key areas of mutual concern, as evidenced by its bilateral exchanges on the climate and AI, its push to discuss nuclear risk reduction, and its participation with China in the U.K.\u2019s AI Safety Summit and the resulting Bletchley Declaration. Under a potential Harris presidency, it is likely these efforts will continue.\n\nThe Trump administration oversaw a dramatic shift in diplomatic engagements with Beijing, Trump has made clear he remains firm in his opposition to China, and commentators at the Heritage Foundation have argued that working with China on AI empowers an adversary to the detriment of U.S. technological leadership. Given this criticism and U.S. conservatives\u2019 broader rhetorical tenor against China, it is hard to imagine track one diplomatic engagement continuing uninterrupted. It is even harder to imagine agreement between the United States and China on shared rules and principles governing advanced AI systems beyond areas where there is a clear mutual interest in avoiding inadvertent escalation.\n\nThe dual objectives of stifling China\u2019s tech industry and ensuring American leadership in the development of powerful AI systems reveal clear contradictions in Trump\u2019s broader tech agenda: antagonism toward China, an opportunistic policy shift on TikTok, and a disdain for Big Tech censorship accompanied by a cozy relationship with some parts of Silicon Valley. Many of the leading developers of frontier AI models today are the same companies that Trump believes have wronged him and that conservative lawmakers criticize for exerting too much power in digital markets and silencing conservative speech. Undercutting those companies may harm America\u2019s ability to guide the development of frontier models. How the Trump administration reconciles these competing priorities is anyone\u2019s guess, though several tech leaders are betting it will net out in their favor.\n\nThere are, however, several areas where we might instead expect continuity. Export controls on advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment began under the Trump administration and accelerated under the Biden administration. There is some indication that Harris could continue this targeted approach in a new administration; however, she has been critical of Trump\u2019s tariffs in the past. Trump has said that he would impose a tariff of greater than 60% on Chinese goods, and a second Trump administration would likely take an even more aggressive posture on trade with China. As a result, this type of restriction is likely to continue or be tightened. Importantly, the implementation of the export control regime for semiconductors depends, in part, on compliance from allies\u2014in particular the Netherlands and Japan. Under a more transactional \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy, the Trump administration may struggle to maintain support from key partners who control vital chokepoints in the semiconductor supply chain. This could make it even more difficult to thwart China\u2019s AI and military progress.\n\nShould Trump win a second term in office, we are also likely to see a continued focus on extreme harms of AI safety (e.g., biotech), but less of a focus on AI\u2019s impact on civil rights. A key focus of the Biden administration\u2019s AI policy has been the impact of the technology on workers, marginalized communities, and other groups that are particularly vulnerable to disruption from transformative technologies. In her address ahead of the Bletchley Summit, Harris rejected a narrow focus on existential risk, remarking that harms to individual rights and well-being \u201calso feel existential\u201d to those they affect. Given the strong deregulatory bent of the first Trump administration and the Republican Party more broadly, coupled with Trump\u2019s hostility toward ideas like diversity, equity, and inclusion and \u201cwokeness,\u201d these challenges may be deprioritized as part of a second Trump administration\u2019s AI policy.\n\nThere does seem to be general convergence around AI safety and the potential catastrophic risks from frontier AI systems as important policy issues. Trump himself has called AI a \u201csuperpower\u201d that is \u201cvery disconcerting\u201d and even opponents of Biden\u2019s EO have recognized the need for guardrails. Though there is widespread opposition among Republican leaders to perceived executive overreach by the Biden administration, the earlier voluntary commitments could be the type of nonbinding, self-governance measures that a deregulatory second Trump administration might favor.",

        "text": "The Fed Could Cut Interest Rates Before The Election, Risking Political Fallout\nKey Takeaways The Federal Reserve appears to be on track to cut its benchmark interest rate in September, just two months ahead of the general election in November.\n\n\n\nAccording to conventional wisdom, a rate cut could boost the economy and encourage voters to reward the incumbent political party.\n\n\n\nFed officials value the central bank's independence and avoid stepping into political matters or favoring either party.\n\n\n\nThe risk of being accused of favoritism hasn't stopped the Fed from election-season rate cuts in the past when economic conditions warranted them.\n\n\n\nPolicymakers at the Federal Reserve try to avoid politics at all costs\u2014but the central bank is widely expected to cut interest rates ahead of the November presidential election, a move that risks causing backlash.\n\nThe trajectory of the economy has set the Fed on a collision course with the general election, and possibly with former president Donald Trump, the Republican candidate in the 2024 race. Investors and economists expect the Fed to cut its benchmark interest rate by September.\n\nBut in an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek last week, Trump said a Fed rate cut ahead of the election was \u201csomething that they know they shouldn\u2019t be doing.\"\n\nWhy The Election Could Be Troublesome For The Fed\n\nThe dilemma for the Fed\u2019s Open Market Committee (FOMC), which makes decisions on interest rates, is that it\u2019s supposed to be independent. Fed officials say the central bank does its job more effectively because it stays out of the political fray.\n\nInterest rate cuts during election season, however, could call that independence into question.\n\n\u201cIf the Fed aggressively cuts its key interest rate, interest rates like mortgage rates, credit card rates and other borrowing rates will likely follow,\u201d Mike Walden, an emeritus economics professor at North Carolina State University wrote in a blog post earlier this year. \u201cMore people will be able to buy homes, vehicles and other items, lifting consumer confidence and happiness. And, if people are more confident and happier, they may be more likely to reward incumbent politicians by voting for them.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd helping one party\u2014in this case, the Democrats\u2014could provoke the opposition in this election season. Some members of the Trump campaign have reportedly floated proposals to give the president a say in the Fed\u2019s decisions on monetary policy.\n\n\u201cThe FOMC has an undeniable (if never acknowledged) incentive to avoid initiating cuts in the last two months of a presidential election campaign,\u201d Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a commentary.\n\nElections Haven\u2019t Stopped Past Rate Cuts\n\nExpectations have risen that the Fed will soon cut its benchmark rate from its current 23-year high because economic activity has slowed and inflation is on the path down toward the central bank's 2% annual target.\n\nFed officials recently have acknowledged the progress in taming inflation, while also saying that a delay in cutting rates could cause unemployment to rise. The Fed has a dual mandate to keep prices stable and maintain maximum employment.\n\nDespite all the reasons to avoid election-season rate cuts, the Fed has made them in the past, Meera Pandit, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Chase, noted in a recent commentary.\n\nThe last time the Fed cut rates within two months of an election was in 2008 when the Fed chopped rates to near zero during the Great Recession. Before that, the Fed cut rates in 1992 as the economy slowed. Neither of those rate cuts helped the incumbent party to stay in power, as in both years the White House changed hands from Republicans to Democrats.\n\n\u201cWhether the Fed was adjusting based on dynamic economic conditions, responding to severe recessions, or following a path already forged, it continued to pursue its dual mandate irrespective of elections,\u201d Pandit wrote.\n\n",

        "text": "Economic Factors and Currency Volatility in the 2024 US Presidential Election\nIn March 2024, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) concluded its extensive monetary easing program, including its negative interest rate policies, which had been in place for over eight years. The central bank maintained its interest rate at 0.10%. Traders are now closely watching for any signals from the BOJ regarding quantitative tightening (QT), as the bank is expected to gradually reduce its bond holdings. This process, if not carefully managed, could potentially disrupt the market. To mitigate this, the BOJ might opt to reduce bond purchases at a slower rate than their holding expiration, a strategy requiring cautious execution.\n\nThe Japanese yen is currently trading near its lowest point versus the dollar in 38 years, and at a level not seen since 1986, worrying traders.Despite both the US and Japan maintaining their interest rates for a prolonged period, the yen has continued to weaken against the dollar, contributing to market uncertainty. As a result, and in a measure to stop \u2018excessive fluctuations driven by speculation\u2019, the Bank of Japan is known to have intervened at least once in recent history, aiming to prop up yen prices. Owing to abnormalities in price action, some traders have speculated that market intervention has happened more than just once, but the BoJ has yet to officially confirm.\n\nAlthough the BOJ is in a rate-raising mode and the Fed is expected to cut rates, the interest rate differential between the US dollar and the Japanese yen remains appealing. Carry trades on USD/JPY can still offer returns for long-term investors, though these returns may be lower than other carry trade opportunities. However, they might also involve less risk compared to other available carry trade pairs.",

        "text": "Election 2024: Kamala Harris Is the Democratic Presidential Nominee\nWhat a difference a week makes.\n\nJust seven days ago, Republicans were coming off a successful party convention thinking that the 2024 race was turning into a rout. Meanwhile, Democrats feared that the Republicans were right. Some Democrats worried that President Joe Biden would stay in a race he had little chance of winning. Other Democrats feared that Biden\u2019s exit would trigger intra-party fighting that would guarantee Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House.\n\nAs it happened, everyone was wrong. Biden acknowledged on Sunday afternoon that his campaign was hemorrhaging support and ended his campaign. Democrats quickly coalesced around Vice President Kamala Harris as their candidate. And a race that looked to be breaking for the Republicans once again tightened.\n\nThe Water's Edge James M.

Within thirty-six hours of Biden\u2019s decision she had locked up the support of a majority of the delegates to the Democratic National Convention. She and the Democratic Party also raised more than $100 million from more than 1.1 million donors, most of whom were new donors. Her candidacy energized a Democratic base that was lukewarm about Biden\u2019s candidacy even before his disastrous debate performance.\n\nHarris\u2019s coronation benefited from the fact that no other prominent Democrat threw their hat into the ring even as powerbrokers like Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi indicated that they favored an open nominating process. One reason for the absence of challengers was the fear of being blamed for trying to keep Harris from ascending to the top of the ticket. Another reason was that the campaign war chest that the Biden-Harris campaign compiled likely could go only to Harris. It\u2019s hard to run a winning campaign without deep pockets, especially when Election Day is just over three months away.\n\nHarris used her first campaign event to lay out her electoral message. Speaking at a high school in a Milwaukee suburb not far from where the Republicans convened last week, she stressed that she will, like the district attorney she once was, prosecute the case against Trump as a threat to America\u2019s democracy. She also made clear that defending abortion rights and improving the economy top her to-do list.\n\nHarris said nothing of note about foreign policy while on the campaign trail, which reflects both political calculation and personal preference. China, Gaza, Ukraine, and other issues overseas fall far down their list of priorities. At the same time, Harris made her career as a district attorney and attorney general, not as a diplomat or military strategist. She certainly has foreign policy experience\u2014both from her time as a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee and as vice president for the past three-plus years. But that is not the same thing as having a passion for it.\n\nThe fact that Harris does not have an extensive foreign policy record independent of her work as vice president has prompted speculation about what her foreign policy might be. Her general approach to foreign policy will almost certainly be in the same area code as Biden\u2019s\u2014and most other Democrats\u2014if not the same zip code. Indeed, some 350 foreign policy luminaries signed a letter vouching for her foreign policy bona fides. What no one knows, however, is what her priorities and red lines will be. The world looks different when one moves from adviser to decider.\n\nRepublicans made much of Harris\u2019s refusal to preside over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s address to Congress on Wednesday. That critique loses whatever force it is supposed to have had once one considers that Republican Vice-Presidential Candidate J.D. Vance also skipped the speech.\n\nThe Trump campaign will also seek to hang the Biden administration policy failures at the U.S. southern border on Harris. House Republicans yesterday passed a resolution \u201cstrongly condemning\u201d Harris by name as the \u201cBorder Czar\u201d for her \u201cfailure to secure the United States border.\u201d Six Democrats supported the resolution. Harris\u2019s obvious retort is that Trump pressured congressional Republicans into walking away from a bipartisan deal to address the border crisis because a continued crisis helped him politically.\n\nAs historic as Harris\u2019s first week was, her road to the White House remains challenging. Only one sitting vice president, George H.W. Bush, has ascended to the presidency via the ballot box in the last 188 years. Harris is also serving a president whose public approval rating just hit a new low of 36 percent. And unlike many other established democracies, the United States has never elected a woman to be head of government.\n\nThe lesson to keep in mind, as Harris should know firsthand from her failed 2020 presidential race, is that strong starts don\u2019t guarantee winning finishes.\n\nCampaign Update\n\nTrump seems conflicted about whether to debate Harris. After Biden bowed out of the race on Sunday, Trump took to Truth Social to argue that the scheduled September 10 debate \u201cshould be held on FoxNews, rather than very biased ABC.\u201d On Tuesday, he told reporters that he was game to square off against Harris, even on ABC, which he called \u201ca joke.\u201d He went on to say that presidential nominees have \u201can obligation to debate\u201d and that he \u201cwould be willing to do more than one debate actually.\u201d Then yesterday, the Trump campaign tweeted that it would be \u201cinappropriate to schedule things with Harris because Democrats very well could still change their minds.\u201d In response, Harris tweeted: \u201cWhat happened to \u2018any time, any place?\u2019\u201d While all this was happening, Fox News invited Harris and Trump to debate on September 17. The network suggested that the debate be held in Pennsylvania with a format to be determined. No word yet on whether the candidates will accept the offer.\n\nDemocrats plan to hold a virtual roll call by August 7 to determine their nominee. The move reflects uncertainty over whether the change that a special session of the Ohio state legislature recently made to the state\u2019s electoral laws would allow a candidate selected at the Democratic National Convention later in August to make the state\u2019s ballot in 2024. One practical consequence of the virtual roll call vote is that any Democrat seeking to challenge Harris for the nomination has until this weekend to file the necessary paperwork to be considered.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. has been absent from the campaign trail in recent weeks. The Washington Post reported that he met with Trump last week in Milwaukee. Kennedy reportedly offered to quit the race if Trump promised him a job in his administration should he return to the White House. Trump declined the offer.\n\nWhat the Candidates Are Saying\n\nTrump made clear on social media and on the campaign trail that he\u2019s not a fan of Harris, although he contributed $6,000 to Harris\u2019s reelection campaign for California\u2019s attorney general back in 2012 and 2013. On Truth Social, Trump called Harris \u201cLyin\u2019 Kamala Harris.\u201d\n\nIn a rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Wednesday, Trump called Harris \u201cthe most incompetent and far-left vice president in American history,\u201d insisted that she was a \u201cradical left lunatic who will destroy our country,\u201d and vowed that he was \u201cnot going to be nice\u201d to her. The unity moment has passed.\n\nHarris met with Netanyahu late yesterday afternoon. She followed up the meeting with brief remarks to the press. She stressed that \u201cIsrael has a right to defend itself,\u201d blasted Hamas as \u201ca brutal terrorist organization,\u201d said she had \u201cserious concern about the scale of human suffering in Gaza,\u201d called for quick action to \u201cget a cease-fire to end the war,\u201d and endorsed the two-state solution \u201cas the only path that ensures that Israel remains a secure Jewish and Democratic state.\u201d\n\nIt was a sign of the changing order in the White House that Harris rather than Biden spoke to the press.\n\nWhat the Pundits Are Saying\n\nElliott Cohen argued in The Atlantic that Trump isn\u2019t likely to make significant changes in U.S. foreign policy should he return to the White House. His reasoning for why \u201ca second Trump term may not be a riot of alliance-shattering isolationism, bellicose warmongering, or catastrophically stupid diplomacy?\u201d It\u2019s largely that \u201cone of the deeper truths about American foreign policy, rejected every four years by Democrats and Republicans alike, is that it has much more continuity to it than rupture.\u201d That, of course, is an argument that is true up until the moment it isn\u2019t. And Cohen admits that if Trump populates his administration with \u201csome of the marginal figures in his camp, such as the disgraced and dotty Michael Flynn, or for political figures like Senator Tom Cotton and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u201d\u2014which could well happen\u2014then \u201cserious trouble awaits.\u201d Perhaps the critical question, though, isn\u2019t how different Trump\u2019s foreign policy will be, but the effectiveness of whatever foreign policy he chooses to follow.\n\nForeign Policy\u2019s Stephen Walt dismissed the foreign policy that Trump and Vance are championing as unrealistic and likely to \u201cdo enormous long-term damage to America\u2019s global position.\u201d Walt, who sympathizes with Trump\u2019s distrust of Washington\u2019s foreign policy elites, believes that \u201cthe central problem is that Trump and Vance are operating with an outdated picture of America\u2019s place in the world and its ability to get its way unilaterally. They may reject neoconservatism, but they believe the United States can do whatever it wants and that other states will simply bend to its will. This wasn\u2019t true during the \u201cunipolar moment,\u201d however, and it is even less true now that China is an economic peer and states from India to Brazil to South Africa to Turkey are charting their own courses and able to play the other major powers off against one another.\u201d\n\nUniversity of Texas historian Jeremy Suri wrote in Foreign Policy that Vance isn\u2019t likely to shape U.S. foreign policy in a second Trump administration should Trump win in November. He bases his conclusion on the fact that most vice presidents have little or no impact on foreign policy, which has been the case for more than two centuries. Along the way Suri retells one of the best descriptions ever made about the vice presidency. It was uttered by someone who should know, Thomas Marshall, who served as Woodrow Wilson\u2019s understudy for eight years: \u201cOnce there were two brothers. One ran away to sea; the other was elected vice president. And nothing was ever heard of either of them again.\u201d Suri\u2019s piece is worth reading just to see how many U.S. vice presidents lamented their decision to be the spare tire of government.\n\nThe New York Times\u2019s Lisa Friedman charted Harris\u2019s views on climate change. The topline is that \u201cHarris has for years made the environment a top concern, from prosecuting polluters as California\u2019s attorney general to sponsoring the Green New Deal as a senator to casting the tiebreaking vote as vice president for the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, the largest climate investment in United States history.\u201d\n\nAaron Mannes assessed Harris\u2019s work in the Biden administration for Foreign Policy. He noted that she \u201chas faced significant barriers to helping Biden. Since the expansion of the vice-presidential role in the late 1970s, most presidents have been outsiders to Washington, D.C. \u2026.. Biden, with 36 years in the Senate (during which he focused on foreign affairs) and eight years as vice president, had little need for assistance.\u201d He added that Harris\u2019s \u201cforeign-policy work does not indicate a grand strategy or worldview. Instead, her work has been about developing a skill set of policymaking and implementation, as well as learning and using the tools available to her office.\u201d\n\nMatt Duss, a former foreign policy advisor to Sen. Bernie Sanders, argued in Foreign Policy that Harris can reset U.S. policy toward Gaza. Duss acknowledged that \u201cno one expects Harris to dramatically distance herself from Biden.\u201d However, she \u201ccan announce that as president, she will immediately suspend the U.S.-supplied military aid being used in violation of U.S. law. She can publicly make clear that she agrees with the assessment of countless Israelis\u2014including Israeli opposition lawmakers and top sitting security officials\u2014that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is stalling hostage release and cease-fire efforts in order to cling to power. She can reject the baseless and inflammatory claims that the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), the largest and most important relief agency in Gaza, is a \u201cHamas front,\u201d and state that she\u2019ll work to see UNRWA funding resumed as soon as legally possible. In doing so, she would join U.S. partners\u2014such as Britain, France, and Germany\u2014that have already resumed their contributions.\u201d\n\nWhat the Polls Show\n\nAn AP-NORC poll conducted before Biden dropped out of the race found that nearly six in ten Americans want Trump to drop out of the race as well. Not surprisingly, support for an end to Trump\u2019s candidacy was highest among Democrats, with 86 percent favoring his departure. But 51 percent of Independents and 26 percent of Republicans felt the same way.\n\nThe Campaign Schedule\n\nThe Democratic National Convention opens in Chicago in twenty-four days (August 19, 2024).\n\nThe second presidential debate is in forty-six days (September 10, 2024)\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s sentencing hearing on his New York felony convictions is in fifty-four days (September 18, 2024).\n\nThe first in-person absentee voting in the nation begins in Minnesota and South Dakota in fifty-six days (September 20, 2024).\n\nElection Day is 102 days away.\n\nInauguration Day is 178 days away.\n\nShelby Sires assisted in the preparation of this post.",

        "text": "Obama endorses Kamala Harris for president, solidifying Democratic support\nWashington \u2014 Former President Barack Obama endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for the Democratic presidential nomination Friday, calling her a \"happy warrior\" and vowing to do all he can to help her defeat former President Donald Trump in November.\n\nIn a video posted by her campaign, Harris takes a call from Obama and his wife, former first lady Michelle Obama.\n\n\"We called to say Michelle and I couldn't be prouder to endorse you and do everything we can to get you through this election and into the Oval Office,\" Obama tells Harris over the phone.\n\nMichelle Obama tells Harris, \"I am proud of you. This is going to be historic.\"\n\nIn the video, Harris tells them, \"this means so much to me. I am looking forward to doing this with the two of you, Doug and I both, and getting out there, being on the road. But most of all, I just wanna tell you that the words you have spoken and the friendship that you have given over all these years mean more than I can express.\"\n\nIn a separate statement sent in a campaign email, the Obamas said they agreed with President Biden that selecting Harris as his running mate was \"one of the best decisions he's made.\"\n\n\"There is no doubt in our mind that Kamala Harris has exactly what it takes to win this election and deliver for the American people,\" their statement read. \"At a time when the stakes have never been higher, she gives us all reason to hope.\"\n\nWith Obama's endorsement, Harris has secured support from all major Democrats and party leaders in Congress. Mr. Biden was the first to back his vice president, doing so soon after he announced his exit from the presidential race. He was joined in a matter of days by former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.\n\nHarris and Obama have been in regular contact since Mr. Biden announced his decision to drop out, a source familiar with the matter said, noting they have known each other for 20 years.\n\nHarris has also won the backing of Democratic governors who are considered rising stars in the party and were viewed as possible contenders to seek the party's nomination in the event of Mr. Biden's withdrawal, such as Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear.\n\nNo other Democrat has announced their candidacy for the presidential nod. Harris has secured endorsements from more than 40 state delegations, surpassing the number of delegates she will need to win the nomination. If that support holds, Democrats will officially nominate her for president during a virtual roll call vote early next month.\n\nUnder new rules adopted by the Democratic National Committee on Wednesday, the nominee will be selected as soon as Aug. 1, and the candidate, likely Harris, has until Aug. 7 to select a running mate. The party will meet for its convention in Chicago starting Aug. 19.\n\nHarris launched her presidential campaign hours after Mr. Biden announced in a letter to the American people that he would be forgoing his bid for a second term. The decision came after the president faced weeks of mounting pressure to step aside following his startling debate performance against Trump last month, which raised concerns about his fitness for a second term and ability to defeat his GOP opponent in November.\n\nIn an Oval Office address Wednesday, his first since revealing he would not seek reelection, Mr. Biden acknowledged it was time to \"pass the torch\" to a new generation of leaders.\n\n\"I believe my record as president, my leadership in the world, my vision for America's future, all merited a second term,\" he said. \"But nothing \u2014 nothing \u2014 can come in the way of saving our democracy. That includes personal ambition.\"\n\nThe president hailed Harris as \"experienced,\" \"tough\" and \"capable.\"\n\nHarris, who was a senator from California before her election as vice president, quickly hit the campaign trail with events in Wisconsin, Indiana and Texas. Her campaign said it raked in more than $100 million between Sunday afternoon, when she officially joined the White House race, and Monday evening.\n\nNidia Cavazos contributed reporting.",

        "text": "Kamala Harris: Three ways Donald Trump will try to end the honeymoon\nThree ways Trump is trying to end the Harris honeymoon\n\nRelive a wild month in US politics in about two minutes\n\nAt a moment of unprecedented turbulence in modern American political history, Kamala Harris is having a remarkably smooth ride. It may not last long. Tony Fabrizio, Donald Trump\u2019s campaign pollster, calls it a \u201cHarris Honeymoon\u201d \u2013 where a combination of good press and positive energy have combined to give the Democrat a surge of momentum. The thing about honeymoons, of course, is that they come to an end. The realities of married life, or in this case the relationship between Ms Harris and the American voting public, has a way of reasserting itself. For now, the champagne corks are flying for team Harris and Democrats may be experiencing an unfamiliar emotion \u2013 hope. But Republicans, after initially being caught somewhat flatfooted by Mr Biden\u2019s historic announcement, are redirecting their fire at the new presumptive nominee. Here\u2019s a look at three areas on which their recent attacks have focused \u2013 and some ways Democrats may try to deflect them.\n\n1. Calling Harris a 'radical' leftist\n\nThe travails of Ms Harris\u2019 unsuccessful campaign for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination are well documented. They include a lack of clear messaging, a campaign rife with internal discord and a candidate who was prone to awkward interviews and gaffes. Something else happened during the then-senator\u2019s ill-fated presidential bid, however. She \u2013 like many of the candidates in that race \u2013 tacked sharply to the left, to be more in line with Democratic primary voters. \u201cThere was a lot of pressure on those guys from the activist base,\u201d said Matt Bennett, the executive vice-president for public affairs at Third Way, a centrist Democratic think tank. \u201cWhen you\u2019re competing in a primary, your political priorities are very different than the sprint to the finish in a general election.\u201d Over the course of 2019 \u2013 in debates and interviews - Ms Harris endorsed scrapping private health insurance for a government-run system. She praised policing reform, including redirecting law-enforcement budgets to other priorities. She endorsed decriminalising undocumented entry into the US and entertained abolishing Ice, the immigration and customs enforcement agency. She backed the sweeping Green New Deal environmental legislation and supported a ban on fracking and off-shore drilling. Now those positions could come back to haunt her.\n\nGetty Images Harris seen at a presidential primary debate in 2019, alongside Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden\n\nDavid McCormick, a Republican candidate for Senate in Pennsylvania, was quick to produce a television advertisement hitting on Ms Harris\u2019 2019 positions and tying them to his opponent, Democratic Senator Bob Casey. And Trump has released a video titled \"MEET SAN FRANCISCO RADICAL KAMALA HARRIS\" that includes many of the policies she backed during that time. Conservative commentator Matt Walsh called it a \u201cblueprint\u201d for how to attack the vice-president. \u201cShe can argue, correctly, that good leaders change their position on policy and they don\u2019t change her principles,\u201d Mr Bennett, the Democratic strategist, said. \u201cNone of her principles have changed.\u201d If she doesn\u2019t do that convincingly, she could lose support from independent and undecided voters that will determine the outcome of the election in key swing states.\n\n2. Tying Harris to Biden's record\n\nPolls show the Biden campaign had been floundering for months. His immigration policies were unpopular. Even though inflation has eased and the economy is growing, voters still blamed him for higher prices. His ongoing support for Israel in the Gaza War was sapping his support among young voters. Ms Harris, in her role as vice-president, will at least be somewhat tied to the entirety of the current administration\u2019s record \u2013 for better or for worse. Republicans are already trying to hang the immigration issue around her neck, labelling her as the administration\u2019s \u201cborder czar\u201d \u2013 an inaccurate but damaging characterisation that was also used by the media. They cite her past statements on immigration and a claim, during an interview in 2022, that the \u201cborder is secure\u201d. \u201cKamala Harris is currently only known as a failed and unpopular vice-president who knifed her boss in the back to secure a nomination she couldn\u2019t earn, but voters are about to learn, it gets worse,\u201d Taylor Budowich, who runs the political action committee affiliated with the Trump campaign, said in a statement touting $32m in upcoming television advertisements targeting the vice-president.\n\nGetty Images Migrant arrivals and detentions are down after historic highs earlier in Biden's term\n\nAccording to Mr Bennett, Ms Harris won\u2019t be able to fully distance herself from the Biden record, but she might be able to put it in new light for voters, even in the face of Republican attacks. \u201cWhat she can do is make this about the future in ways that were going to be very difficult for an 81-year-old guy to do,\u201d he says. \u201cShe can argue that Trump wants only to look backward.\u201d\n\n3. Attacking her years as a prosecutor\n\nIn the first public rally of her presidential campaign, Ms Harris unveiled a particularly pointed line of attack against the former president. Noting that she had served as a courtroom prosecutor and as California\u2019s attorney general, she said she had faced off against \u201cperpetrators of all kinds\u201d. \u201cSo hear me when I say I know Donald Trump\u2019s type,\u201d she concluded. Craig Varoga, a Democratic campaign consultant and adjunct instructor at American University, calls the vice-president\u2019s law-enforcement background her \u201csuperpower\u201d \u2013 one that she was not fully able to use on the Democratic campaign trail in 2019, when policing reform was a top issue. But Trump's campaign is already showing signs on how they might respond. His campaign manager, Chris LaCivita, made his bones in the Republican Party by taking on another Democratic candidate\u2019s supposed superpower and turning it against him. Back in 2004, Democratic nominee John Kerry was touting his record as a decorated Vietnam War veteran as proof that he would be an effective commander-in-chief during the Iraq War. Mr LaCivita spearheaded a series of attack adverts questioning Mr Kerry\u2019s patriotism and heroism, featuring sailors who served with Kerry on a Navy swift boat patrolling the rivers and shorelines in Vietnam. It gave rise to the term \u201cSwift-boating\u201d \u2013 which means to disarm a candidate by attacking their perceived strength. And it looks like Trump's campaign is gearing up for attacks on the vice-president's prosecutorial record. On one hand, they are hitting her for being too tough \u2013 particularly on black men for drug crimes \u2013 in an attempt to undermine support from her base. On the other, they are citing instances where Ms Harris either chose not to prosecute or allowed the parole of individuals who went on to commit new crimes. Mr Varoga concedes that Democrats botched their response to the Swift-boat attacks in 2004, but he says they\u2019ve learned their lesson and Ms Harris will be ready for the onslaught. \u201cIf LaCivita thinks he\u2019s going to fool the entire Democratic establishment again, he can live with that delusion and also lose,\u201d he said.\n\nA race to define Harris\n\nIn his memo, Mr Fabrizio said that Ms Harris \u201ccan\u2019t change who she is or what she\u2019s done\u201d. He promised that voters will soon view her as Mr Biden\u2019s \u201cpartner and co-pilot\u201d and learn about her \u201cdangerously liberal record\u201d. The upcoming advertising onslaught, along with Trump\u2019s public statements and rally attacks, will be the tip of this Republican spear. Meanwhile, Ms Harris and her campaign will work to offer their own definition of who the candidate is and what she stands for. One particularly effective way to do this, according to Mr Varoga, is with her selection of a vice-presidential running mate. \u201cIt\u2019s the first real decision that a candidate for president makes that\u2019s out there for the public to see,\u201d he said. \u201cThat will go a long way toward people understanding what kind of future she\u2019s going to pursue.\u201d",

        "text": "Trump shooting: Thomas Crooks' plan and the botched security\nTrump shooting: The plan and the botched security\n\nGetty Images Secret service agents surround Trump after Crooks' shot grazes his ear\n\nThomas Matthew Crooks walked into Donald Trump's election rally in Pennsylvania, unopposed with a gun, explosives and a rangefinder to measure distance to his target. The aftermath of the 13 July shooting reveals a detailed plan hatched in the days before - and a series of security failings that allowed its execution. Three congressional hearings were held this week with the head of the FBI, the Secret Service's director and Pennsylvania's state police chief. Here is what those hearings have added to what is known about the attempt on Trump's life, what went wrong, and important unanswered questions.\n\nThe preparation\n\nIt is becoming clear that Crooks' attack was not the result of a last-minute meltdown: He had method, and purpose. The FBI has said that 6 July appeared to be the inception date: Crooks registered to attend Trump's rally, and researched the assassination of President John F Kennedy, googling: \"How far away was Oswald from Kennedy?\" \"That's a search that's obviously significant in terms of his state of mind,\" Christopher Wray, the FBI's director, told the House Judiciary committee on Wednesday. He added that searches by Crooks then became \"focused\" on Trump. He was working alone - the FBI say they do not think he received any help. There was also reconnaissance. Mr Wray said Crooks was flying a drone about 200 yards (183m) from the stage two hours before Trump's rally. Its camera ran for about 11 minutes, Mr Wray said, and the footage would have shown \"a rear-view mirror of the scene\" behind Crooks' eventual firing position.\n\nMr Wray said that Crooks had bought an AR-15-style rifle from his father, legally, although he did not say when. The gun had a collapsible stock, making it easier to conceal. State police officers reported him using a rangefinder, a marksman's aid that measures distance to a target, as the rally got under way. Crooks had also obtained explosives: two \"crude\" devices fitted with receivers were found in Crooks' car after the attack, Mr Wray said, and a transmitter was found on his body. A bloodied receipt was also found on Crooks for a 5ft ladder, Mr Wray said - suggesting a recent buy. No ladder was found at the site, however, and Mr Wray said Crooks had used \"mechanical equipment\" to get to his perch - but did not elaborate. And so Crooks turned up on the day with a concealable rifle, knowledge of previous assassinations, a rangefinder, two bombs, and detailed information on the layout of the area.\n\nA plan in action\n\nIt should be impossible for a man to walk into a presidential rally with so much gear, let alone carry it up to an undefended roof with a direct line of sight to the stage. But this is exactly what happened in Butler. Statements to the House Homeland Security committee by Pennsylvania's police commissioner, Christopher Paris, convey a series of lapses from law enforcement. The venue had two layers of security - an outer area patrolled by state police and an inner perimeter manned by Secret Service agents, including an anti-sniper team on a roof behind the stage. An operations centre was staffed by members of the various agencies present. But on the day, communication was haphazard and areas of responsibility unclear. Mr Paris told his hearing that state police were responsible for the area around the AGR International warehouse, the building from which Crooks fired that was around 400ft (122m) from the stage with a clear line of sight. He revealed his men had raised its risk in the days before the rally and were told by the Secret Service that it was a state police matter as it was in the outer area. As a consequence, a local SWAT-style Emergency Services Unit (ESU) team was stationed inside the building complex, Mr Paris added. The New York Times reported that the team was in fact two men who stayed inside because of the hot weather. The plan had been approved by the Secret Service, the newspaper's source said. Kimberly Cheatle, director of the Secret Service until she stepped down this week, told lawmakers she could not account for why no one was stationed on the roof.\n\nGetty Images Armed police react after Crooks shoots at Trump\n\nWhat went wrong?\n\nMr Paris said the first sighting of Crooks came from a state police ESU unit. Unlike others in the crowd, Crooks was walking around and did not try to enter the venue, he said. \"Crooks never made it through the secure perimeter.\" He was not challenged. Mr Paris said he was one of three people flagged as \"suspicious\" at this point in the event. About 25 minutes before the rally began, however, Mr Paris said that the ESU team spotted him again - this time using his rangefinder, though no gun was reported. This is perhaps the point where security broke down irrevocably. A photograph of Crooks was sent by a member of the ESU team to a state trooper in the joint operations room. Mr Paris said that a Secret Service liaison asked the trooper to send the photo to another number. At this point, it seems that agents charged with protecting Trump did not consider Crooks dangerous enough to act - no weapon had been spotted. During her fractious hearing before the House Oversight committee on Monday, Ms Cheatle acknowledged her agents were told about Crooks at least twice before the shooting began. She said that agents only became aware of the gravity of the threat \"seconds before the gunfire started\".\n\nThe crucial moments\n\nMr Paris said several local police, including the ESU team, then began searching for Crooks. It appears he was lost again, despite his growing threat. Witnesses told the BBC that by this point they had seen a man with a gun crawling along a roof. All of this was happening with Trump already on stage. Mr Paris said that Crooks was eventually seen on the roof by local traffic police and his ESU team. One traffic officer boosted up to the roof by a colleague was forced to fall back after being confronted by Crooks, Mr Paris told the hearing. That confrontation, the commissioner said, happened \"a matter of seconds\" before the shooting. Agents surrounded Trump immediately after the first shots, and he was off the stage within two minutes. By this point Crooks had been shot dead by a sniper. A video recorded on the roof about an hour after the attack shows snipers and Secret Service agents trying to understand who saw what and when, adding to the sense of confusion among law enforcement. Eight bullet casings were found near his body. He had killed one crowd member and injured two others. Amid speculation over whether Trump was actually hit by a bullet, the FBI confirmed two weeks afterwards that the Republican was indeed wounded by a round from the suspect's weapon. The agency said in a statement: \"What struck former President Trump in the ear was a bullet, whether whole or fragmented into smaller pieces, fired from the deceased subject\u2019s rifle.\"\n\nGetty Images Cheatle quit a day after facing Congress and providing few answers\n\nWhy was Trump allowed on stage?\n\nTrump was on stage for around 10 minutes between the moment Crooks was spotted on the roof with a gun and the moment he fired his first shot. There is almost no public account of the Secret Service's actions and decisions during the rally. Ms Cheatle declined to answer most of the questions put to her in Congress - down to how many agents were protecting Trump. We do know, via Ms Cheatle, that agents dismissed the alerts about him because he was not seen with a weapon. She could not provide her hearing a detailed timeline, as requested, saying she \"did not have specifics\". She quit as director of the Secret Service a day after her hearing, under pressure from both sides of the House, and it seems we won't get answers any time soon.\n\nWhat was Crooks' motive?\n\nReuters Crooks, in a school photograph from 2020",

The crowd cheered loudly and started to chant \u201cTrump\u201d at this declaration.\n\nMr Gensler led a crackdown on the crypto industry, and has previously said the sector is rife with \u201chucksters\u201d.\n\nThe SEC brought charges against the \"King of Crypto\" Sam Bankman-Fried, who was sentenced to 25 years for stealing billions of dollars from customers of his FTX cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nSpeaking for about 45 minutes, Trump outlined some of his ideas for the sector if he were to win November's election. He said he would make the US the cryptocurrency capital of the world. His support for the industry is a 180 turn from his comments in 2021, when he told Fox Business he saw Bitcoin as a \u201cscam\u201d affecting the value of the US dollar.\n\nTrump told the crowd at the event he would keep 100% of Bitcoin that the US government currently holds or acquires, adding that it would be a \u201cnational Bitcoin stockpile\u201d.\n\nThe former president also said he would \u201cimmediately appoint a Bitcoin and crypto presidential advisory council\u201d.",

        "text": "Trump tells Christian voters they \"won't have to vote anymore\" if he is elected in November\nHarris ramps up campaign as Trump remarks to Christian voters generate controversy\n\nFormer President Donald Trump told attendees at a conservative Christian event on Friday night that they \"won't have to vote anymore\" if he is elected into office in November. He implored Christians to save America by voting \"just this time,\" so that he can win the presidential election in a landslide \"that's too big to rig.\"\n\nTrump, who is the Republican Party's candidate for president, made his remarks at the end of a speech at The Believers' Summit, an event hosted by the conservative advocacy group Turning Point Action, in West Palm Beach, Florida.\n\n\"Christians get out and vote. Just this time,\" he urged. \"You won't have to do it anymore. Four more years. You know what? It'll be fixed. It'll be fine. You won't have to vote anymore my beautiful Christians.\"\n\nFormer U.S. President and 2024 Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump onstage after speaking at Turning Point Action's \"The Believers Summit\" in West Palm Beach, Florida, on July 26, 2024.

We'll have it fixed so good, you're not going to have to vote.\"\n\nOn social media, there were some calls of alarm in response to Trump's comments, expressing concern that they alluded to authoritarianism and could be interpreted as an indication that he would not leave office if he wins the election.\n\n\"Democracy is in danger. This is not a drill,\" posted Allison Gill, who co-hosts the podcast \"Jack,\" along with an image displaying Trump's message to Christians.\n\nToward the end of his hour-long speech, Trump said that the Democrats rigged the 2020 presidential election, which Trump falsely maintained that he won over President Biden.\n\nThe audience gave him a standing ovation, chanting: \"Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight\" and fist-pumping the way Trump did after a bullet grazed his ear during an attempted assassination at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania two weeks ago.\n\nTrump shared that he had removed the last bandage from his ear just before speaking at the event.\n\n\"I just took it off. I took it off for this group. I don't know why I did that for this group, but that's it,\" he said.\n\nBefore Friday night's event, Trump had first been wearing a large white bandage over his ear. By the time of his rally in Charlotte, North Carolina on Wednesday, he was wearing a more discreet flesh-colored one.\n\nCBS News reached out to the Trump campaign for comment on his remarks.\n\nTrump spoke to a packed audience at the summit just hours after meeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at Mar-a-Lago. Netanyahu met with Mr. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris separately a day earlier at the White House. Event organizers said about 3,500 people attended the former president's speech.\n\nHe spent much of his speech criticizing Harris, who is the presumptive Democratic nominee for president after President Biden decided to drop his reelection bid.\n\nOther speakers at the two-day event, which focused on \"unity and biblical truth,\" included former Trump adviser Peter Navarro, Dr. Ben Carson, Housing and Urban Development Secretary during the Trump administration and conservative political activist Charlie Kirk.\n\nNavarro, who was recently released from prison, spoke shortly before Trump and led the audience in a chant of: \"If we don't control our government, their government will control us.\"\n\nHe told the audience that the justice system had unfairly gone after him, using rhetoric similar to that often used by Trump.\n\n\"What happened to me, can happen to you,\" said Navarro. \"If they can come for Donald Trump, they can come for you.\"\n\nNavarro served a four-month sentence for defying a congressional subpoena. He was released earlier this month.\n\nThe former president has previously sought to appeal to evangelical Christians.\n\nIn June, he told a group of politically influential evangelical Christians in Washington that they \"cannot afford to sit on the sidelines\" of the 2024 election, imploring them at one point to \"go and vote, Christians, please!\"",

        "text": "Joe Biden 2024 presidential campaign\nAmerican political campaign\n\nJoe Biden, the 46th and incumbent president of the United States, announced his candidacy for re-election for a second presidential term on April 25, 2023, with Vice President Kamala Harris as his running mate. He suspended the campaign on July 21, 2024.\n\nBiden made protecting American democracy a central focus of his campaign,[7][8] along with restoring the federal right to abortion following the Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade.[9] He also intended to increase funding for border patrol and security,[9][10] and increase funding for law enforcement coupled with police reform.[11] Biden promised to support, protect and expand LGBT rights[9] and frequently touted his previous passage of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the Chips and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act's landmark[12][13] investment to combat climate change.[14]\n\nBiden made strengthening U.S. alliances a key goal of his foreign policy[15] and promised to continue supporting Ukraine following the Russian invasion of the country and Israel following their war with Hamas, describing them as \"vital\" to U.S. national security interests. Biden promised to continue efforts to tackle gun violence and defend the Affordable Care Act following comments from Donald Trump suggesting he would repeal the law.[16][9] He proposed increasing taxes on the wealthy through a \"billionaire minimum income tax\" to reduce the deficit and fund social services for the poor.[17][9] Biden's trade policy was described as rejecting traditional neoliberal economic policy and the Washington Consensus that resulted in the offshoring of manufacturing and populist backlash. It included targeted tariffs against strategic Chinese industries to protect manufacturing jobs and counter China's technological and military ambitions.[18][19]\n\nOn March 12, 2024, Biden became the presumptive nominee of the Democratic Party after clinching enough delegates in Georgia, and did not face any significant primary challengers.[20] The first presidential debate was held on June 27, 2024, between Biden and Trump. Biden's performance was widely criticized, with commentators saying that he frequently lost his train of thought and gave meandering answers.[21][22][23] Several newspaper columnists declared Trump winner of the debate,[24][25][26][27] which was supported by polling results.[28] After the debate, concerns about his health intensified, and Biden faced many calls to withdraw from the race, including from fellow Democrats[29] and the editorial boards of several major news outlets.[30][31]\n\nBiden initially insisted that he would remain a candidate amid the calls to drop out.[32] However, on July 21, 2024, Biden ended his re-election campaign and endorsed vice president Kamala Harris as his successor.[33] Harris launched her own campaign later that day.[34] By July 22, 2024, Harris had secured enough delegates to become the presumptive Democratic nominee.[35]\n\nBackground\n\nThis was Biden's fourth presidential campaign, and was his first as the incumbent.[36] His first campaign was in the 1988 Democratic Party presidential primaries. While he was initially considered one of the strongest candidates in that race, a scandal broke soon thereafter when news reports uncovered plagiarism by Biden in law school records and in speeches. This revelation led to his withdrawal from the race in September 1987.[37]\n\nHe made a second attempt during the 2008 Democratic Party presidential primaries. Like his first presidential bid, Biden failed to garner a sufficient level of endorsements and support. He withdrew from the race after his poor performance in the Iowa caucus on January 3, 2008. He was eventually chosen to be the running mate of the party's nominee Barack Obama. Following the Obama/Biden ticket's victory in the general election, Biden was sworn in as vice president of the United States on January 20, 2009. He ran again as Obama's running mate in 2012 and was re-elected vice president, being sworn in for second term on January 20, 2013, and serving until January 20, 2017.\n\nBiden's third presidential bid came during the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries where he focused his plans as the candidate with the best chance of defeating then-president Donald Trump in the general election. Politico reported in 2018 that Biden had rejected a proposition to commit to serving only one term as president.[38]\n\nIn May 2021, Biden's chief of staff Ron Klain indicated the Biden administration was \"anticipating a bruising general election matchup\" against Donald Trump, who had served as the 45th president of the United States and had been defeated by Biden in the 2020 presidential election, if the latter followed through on a bid to return to the presidency.[39] In November 2021, against a backdrop of declining approval ratings, the Biden White House reiterated Biden's intent to run for reelection.[40] In a March 2022 press conference, when asked about the possibility that Trump could be his opponent in 2024, Biden replied, \"I'd be very fortunate if I had that same man running against me\".[41]\n\nIn a PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist poll released on April 25, 2023 \u2013 the day Biden announced his reelection campaign \u2013 his approval rating was just 41%, with a disapproval rating of 50%.[42] Several polls both before and after Biden's campaign announcement have shown that most Democrats want the party to nominate someone other than Biden for president in the 2024 election.[43][44][45][needs update]\n\nCampaign\n\nBiden and Harris, May 2023\n\nAnnouncement\n\nOn April 25, 2023, Biden announced he was running for re-election. It was also announced that Julie Ch\u00e1vez Rodriguez would serve as campaign manager and Quentin Fulks would be principal deputy campaign manager. Lisa Blunt Rochester, Jim Clyburn, Chris Coons, Tammy Duckworth, Jeffrey Katzenberg, and Gretchen Whitmer were named national campaign co-chairs. Biden's campaign was launched four years to the day after the start of his 2020 presidential campaign.[46] Politico reported that: \"Biden is considering Michael Tyler (the longtime Democratic operative) for the role of communications director in his 2024 campaign\".[47]\n\nBiden formally kicked off his reelection campaign on June 17, 2023, at a union rally in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.[48]\n\nSocial media activity\n\nThe Biden campaign created an account on Truth Social in October 2023.[49] They announced on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) that they had created the account on Truth Social because they found the idea \"very funny\".[50] Numerous observers characterised this as an exercise by the Biden campaign in trolling Donald Trump.[51][52]\n\nIn May 2024, the Biden campaign posted a listing for a full-time Content and Meme Pages Partner Manager. The job description stated, \"In this role, you will initiate and manage day-to-day operations in engaging the internet's top content and meme pages\". The Meme Manager will be a first for a presidential campaign.[53]\n\nNational advisory board\n\nThe Biden-Harris 2024 national advisory board consisted of:[54][55]\n\nPlatform\n\nBiden frequently stated his intention to \"finish the job\" as a campaign theme and political rallying cry.[56][57] Biden was described as a political moderate and centrist,[58] and during the campaign was seeking to attract moderate Republicans and independents for his 2024 reelection bid.[59]\n\nAbortion access\n\nBiden was described as running on one of the most overtly abortion rights platform of any general election candidate in political history.[60] Biden promised to restore Roe v. Wade if reelected, and criticized court rulings limiting abortion access or restricting the availability of abortion pills.[9][61]\n\nDemocracy\n\nBiden made defending American democracy the cornerstone of his presidential campaign, stating during a speech on January 5, 2024, \"the defense, protection and preservation of American democracy will remain, as it has been, the central cause of my presidency.\"[8] Biden frequently called attention to Trump's former attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election[62][63] and its culmination in the January 6 United States Capitol attack,[64][65] widely described as an attempted coup d'\u00e9tat[66][67][68] or self-coup.[69][70] Trump has claimed that Joe Biden is the \"destroyer\"[71] and real threat to democracy,[72] and has repeated false claims that the 2020 election was rigged and stolen from him, of which there has been no evidence.[71]\n\nJoe Biden framed the 2024 election as a battle for democracy and defending the \"soul of America,\"[7] which echoes Biden's framing of current geopolitics as \"the battle between democracy and autocracy.\"[73] Joe Biden previously cited democracy and \"a battle for the soul of our nation\" as a key message of his successful 2020 run, and repeatedly touched on the issue of democracy since announcing his candidacy for the 2020 presidential election.[74]\n\nEconomy and trade\n\nBiden dubbed his economic policy \"Bidenomics\" and promised to create middle-class jobs and reject trickle-down economics. For his 2024 reelection campaign, Biden pointed to his previous passage of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the Chips and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act; all of which are expected to invest $1 to $2 trillion in industrial policy over 10 years.[14] Biden previously passed the American Rescue Plan Act to speed up the economic recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent recession.[75][76]\n\nBiden's trade agenda was described as rejecting traditional neoliberal economic policies and the Washington Consensus in favor of de-risking supply chains from China and economic investment in target nations to address pandemic resilience, climate change, U.N. Sustainable Development Goals and the rejection of Chinese-style autocracy. Biden's policies are expected to increase public-private partnerships through the World Bank and IMF to compete with China's Belt and Road Initiative. Biden stated his intention to reverse neoliberal policies that resulted in the offshoring of manufacturing and thus resulted in increased populist backlash.[18] Biden enacted several targeted tariffs against China in strategic sectors such as EVs, solar cells, steel, and aluminum to protect American manufacturing and blunt China's technological and military ambitions.[19]\n\nEducation\n\nBiden previously supported two-years of free community college during his 2020 campaign, and has continued to propose it in yearly budget requests despite failing to have it pass during negotiations with Republicans as part of his Build Back Better Plan in 2021. Biden promised to triple Title I funding, and as of the end of 2023, managed an 11% increase totaling $2 billion for Title I along with increased funding for Pell Grants and $7.3 billion in investments for HBCU's.[77]\n\nBiden has stated he opposes book bans and has promised to appoint an anti-book ban coordinator to address the issue.[78] Biden has stated that attacks on teachers for talking about race and racism is wrong, and has opposed Florida's Parental Rights in Education Act. Biden supports protections for transgender students while also allowing school districts to restrict transgender women in competitive women's sports through updating Title IX protections.[79]\n\nBiden continues to support student loan relief and had made it a promise of his initial 2020 campaign,[80] and previously attempted a $400 billion student debt relief plan that was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. Biden has since implemented a more modest income-driven $39 billion debt relief plan impacting 800,000 borrowers who had paid their loans over 20 years,[81] and waived some rules regarding the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program that resulted in an additional 662,000 people having some debt canceled. On January 12, 2024, Biden announced debt relief under the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) repayment plan to wipe loans up to $12,000 that have been in repayment for 10 years or more, along with additional measures to take effect in July to limit payments to 5% of discretionary income from the previous 10%.[82] As of the end of 2023, Biden has canceled $132 billion worth of student loans affecting 3.6 million borrowers despite the Supreme Court's prior ruling.[83][79] On January 19, 2024, Biden canceled another $4.9 billion in student loan debt for 73,600 borrowers.[84] On March 21, 2024, Biden announced an additional $5.8 billion in loan relief for 77,700 borrowers through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.[85] On April 12, 2024, Biden announced another $7.4 billion in student loan relief affecting roughly 277,000 borrowers.[86]\n\nEnergy, environment, and climate change\n\nBiden stated he believes in human-caused climate change. Biden previously strengthened environmental protections that had been weakened during the Trump administration. Biden passed the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest investment in addressing climate change and clean energy in US history[88] with over $375 billion in funding and putting the US on track to meet emissions reduction targets by 50-52% below 2005 levels by 2030, and has created 170,600 new clean energy jobs with over $278 billion in new investments in 44 states.[89] Biden has stated his intention to use both regulation and market forces to address climate change, and has established clean energy tax credits and subsidies for electric cars, heat-pumps, and climate friendly technology.[9]\n\nIn addition to record funding for clean energy, Biden has overseen a record in US crude oil production with over 13.2 million barrels of crude per day, beating Saudi Arabia and Russia by millions of barrels and the 13 million barrels per day produced at the peak of Trump's presidency. Biden has previously stated his intention to lower prices at the gas pump, which experts believe is key to his 2024 reelection campaign.[90] Biden's first term dealt with supply shocks caused by the 2021-2024 global energy crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic and Russian invasion of Ukraine.[91]\n\nForeign policy\n\nBiden has been described as presiding over \"the most transformative phase in U.S. foreign policy in decades,\"[92] and has made strengthening American alliances to ensure a \"position of trusted leadership\" among allies to counter Russia and China,[15] and ensuring that no other world power should surpass the United States in the military and economic spheres a focus of his presidency.[93] Biden noticeably sought to reduce U.S. military presence in the Greater Middle East, and withdrew troops from Afghanistan after which the Taliban seized control.[94] Biden has made strengthening the NATO alliance and preparing for great power competition a cornerstone of his first term in office,[95] and has promised to defend the NATO alliance during his second term following reported comments that Trump told European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen that America would \"never come to help you and to support you\" if Europe was attacked.[96] Biden has described modern geopolitics as \"the battle between democracy and autocracy.\"[73] Biden has promised to continue supporting Ukraine following the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Israel following the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel, describing them as \"vital\" to U.S. national security interests.[9] By March 2024, Biden has become increasingly critical of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, and has authorized air drops of aid and announced the construction of a military port to facilitate the delivery of aid to the enclave.[97][98]\n\nGun violence\n\nBiden promised to tackle gun violence through enacting universal background checks and increasing scrutiny of sales in gun shows and other unlicensed venues. Biden has also proposed implementing a ban on assault weapons. Biden was previously instrumental in passing the 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban that expired in 2004, and has spoken of its impacts on the campaign trail.[9][99]\n\nBiden stated his support of the First Step Act, red flag laws, increased background checks, the ability to bar people from carrying guns in schools and allowing gun manufacturers to be sued in court.\n\nBiden previously announced the formation of the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, signed the first major gun control legislation in 30 years through the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act,[100] and issued Executive Order 14092 to stiffen background checks, ensure safer firearms storage and provide additional direction for law enforcement agencies.[9][101]\n\nImmigration\n\nBiden stated his intention to increase funding and resources for border patrol and enforcement, provide a path for people in the United States to apply for legal status and eventually citizenship, and create a smoother and expanded visa process for foreign graduates of American universities. Biden previously introduced the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021 on his first day of office that stalled due to Republican opposition.[9] Biden also issued a memorandum to reinstate the DACA program,[102] overturned Trump's travel ban in Executive Order 13780,[103] and reversed Trump's Executive Order 13768 that targeted sanctuary cities in the United States.[104] The Biden administration has undertaken a policy of punishing migrants who enter the country illegally and providing temporary protections to migrants from certain countries such as Venezuela, Ukraine, Nicaragua, Cuba and Haiti. This has resulted in a total increase in migrants legally arriving at points of entry, and a decrease in migrants attempting to illegally cross the border.[105]\n\nIn February 2024, Biden supported a bipartisan immigration bill to address the Mexico-United States border crisis that included many conservative demands and also unlocked aid to Ukraine and Israel. Trump successfully called on House and Senate Republicans to kill the bill arguing that it would hurt his and Republican's reelection campaigns and deny them the ability to run on immigration as an issue.[106][107][108][109][110] Biden has since promised to campaign \"every day\" on Republican's refusal to pass the bill, stating that Donald Trump is the \"only reason the border is not secure.\"[10] On June 4, 2024, Biden passed an executive order to shut down the border if illegal crossings reached an average of 2,500 migrants a day in a given week.[111]\n\nLaw enforcement\n\nBiden ran on a pro-police message and has explicitly stated his opposition to the \"defund the police\" movement and Republican calls to \"defund the FBI.\"[112][58] Biden previously celebrated billions in funds for police departments in his 2022 State of the Union Address,[11] and has provided hundreds of millions since then towards the hiring of additional police officers, school safety efforts, and community policing efforts.[113] Biden has also called on police reform, stating in February 2023, \"when police officers or police departments violate the public trust, they must be held accountable.\" During his first term, Biden restricted the transfer of military equipment to police, directed federal law enforcement to restrict chokeholds and no-knock warrants, ordered new use-of-force standards within the Justice Department and signed an executive order to create a national database of fired police officers.[11] Biden has repeatedly pushed for community policing and violence intervention efforts and more mental and social services funding.[114]\n\nLGBT, civil, and voting rights\n\nBiden stated he supports protecting the LGBT community and supports access to gender-affirming care.[9] Biden previously passed the Respect for Marriage Act which protected same-sex and interracial marriage in the United States after a concurring opinion from Justice Clarence Thomas in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization that suggested the court should revisit Obergefell v. Hodges.[115][116]\n\nBiden previously attempted to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act in response to the George Floyd protests that ultimately failed after talks with Republican Senators broke down, resulting in Biden's passage of Executive Order 14074.[117] Biden also passed the Emmett Till Antilynching Act to officially make lynching a federal hate crime.[118]\n\nBiden passed Executive Order 14019 to protect voting rights following Republican efforts to restrict voting following the 2020 presidential election,[119] and attempted to pass the For the People Act to reduce the influence of money in politics, ban partisan gerrymandering, and create new federal ethics rules for officeholders that ultimately failed over opposition from Republican Senators.[120]\n\nSocial services and healthcare\n\nBiden promised to include the remaining pledges left out of his initial Build Back Better Act owing to resistance from Senators that ultimately resulted in the compromise Inflation Reduction Act. These include offering two years of free community college tuition, offering universal preschool and limiting the cost of childcare to 7% of income for most families. Biden has also signaled his intention to resuscitate the expanded child tax credit initially passed in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 to $3,000 for children over six and $3,600 to children under 6,[9] which previously resulted in a roughly 30% reduction in child poverty.[121]\n\nBiden has promised to protect and defend the Affordable Care Act after Trump commented he would seek to replace the law if he wins a second term,[16] [122] and Republican senators expressed openness to repealing certain sections of the law.[123][124] Biden has promised to defend Social Security and Medicare following comments made by Trump during a March 11, 2024, interview that suggested he was open to cutting the entitlement programs, which the Trump campaign later said was merely referring to \"cutting waste.\"[125][126] Biden has also signaled his intention to expand the price cap on the cost of insulin at $35 for Medicare recipients enacted as part of the Inflation Reduction Act to private insurance.[9] Biden previously signed one of the largest expansions in veterans benefits in American history through the Honoring our PACT Act of 2022 that provided medical care for veterans exposed to toxic burn pits.[127]\n\nTaxes and deficit reduction\n\nBiden shared plans to increase taxes on the wealthiest Americans to fund social services and reduce the deficit. Biden has proposed raising the top tax rate to 39.6%, the corporate tax rate to 28% and the stock buyback tax to 4%. Biden proposed a \"Billionaire Minimum Income Tax\" that would target one-hundredth of 1% of Americans (roughly 700 billionaires) that would raise over $361 billion over 10 years by ensuring the wealthy pay a minimum tax rate of 20%.[9][17]\n\nBiden previously implemented a 15% minimum tax on companies with annual income exceeding $1 billion.[9] As part of the Inflation Reduction Act, Biden provided a one-time funding boost of $80 billion to the Internal Revenue Service to modernize its systems and hire additional staff to reduce an estimated $688 billion tax gap in uncollected payments by increasing audit rates of the wealthy and tax evaders.[128] On January 12, 2024, the IRS announced it had collected more than $520 million in back taxes from delinquent high-income individuals, complex partnerships and large corporations due to increased funding from the Inflation Reduction Act.[129]\n\nCampaign finances\n\nOverall strategy\n\nThe Biden campaign was reported to plan to raise and spend $2 billion. To get around the $6,600 per donor, per year limitation to Biden's reelection campaign, the Biden campaign's financial strategy has involved closely working with the Democratic National Committee and establishing joint fundraising committees (JFC) with local state parties in all 50 states. As a result, individual donors can donate almost $1 million per year to be distributed to the DNC, local state parties, and the affiliated Biden Victory Fund. Biden's campaign previously gave the DNC its supporter and fundraising data after Inauguration Day in 2021. This approach has been noted to be different to former President Obama's use his own outside organization, Organizing for America, that ultimately competed for donors and left the DNC in debt.[130] Biden was able to raise more cash than Trump early on due to establishing JFC's before Trump was able to due to having primary opponents until March.[131]\n\nFinances throughout the 2024 campaign\n\nIn summer and fall 2023, The Associated Press reported that Democrats were nervous about Biden's lack of fundraising and campaign activity. Of note were the 2023 Writers Guild and SAG-AFTRA strikes in California that prevented Biden from raising money from Hollywood figures owing to his pro-union stance.[132] On January 15, 2024, Biden and the DNC reported taking in $97 million in the final three months of the year and after a December fundraising blitz, and announced that it took in $235 million from its launch in April 2023 and ended the year with $117 million cash on hand.[133]\n\nIn early 2024, Biden's presidential campaign was noted to have a considerable fundraising and cash advantage over Trump in part due to his opponents contributions being diverted to cover his many legal fees.[133] The Biden campaign reported raising $42 million in January with $130 million cash on hand,[134] and raising $53 million in February ending the month with $155 million cash on hand.[135] According to February FEC filings, Biden-aligned super PACs had $64 million cash on hand and $900 million has been pledged by Democratic groups and major unions.[136] According to a March 28 Reuters article, large contributions made up 55% of Biden's support, compared to 65% of Trump's support.[137]\n\nOn April 6, 2024, Biden lagged Trump in total fundraising for the first time, reporting a total April fundraising haul of $51 million compared to Trump's $76.2 million,[131] much of which was raised at Trump's self-reported $50.5 million fundraiser at the house of billionaire John Paulson.[138] The New York Times reported that Trump was widely expected to catch up in total fundraising once he secured the Republican nomination and signed a joint fundraising agreement with the RNC. Biden noticeably beat Trump in total cash on hand, having $84.5 million compared to Trump's $48 million, both figures not including PAC money.[131] Biden's aides noted a lack of big fundraising events and the \"grassroots fundraising machine\" not yet starting were partly to blame for the lower April totals.[139] In June, the Trump campaign reported a $141 million fundraising haul for May, beating Biden's $85 million haul. Trump and the RNC entered June with $235 million on hand compared to Biden's $212 million. The Trump campaign accredited the haul with the aftermath of his 34 felony convictions in May that raised $70 million in the 48 hours after the verdict and briefly crashed WinRed. Trump also received a $50 million donation from billionaire Timothy Mellon. Biden increased fundraising events in June, including a $30 million event in Los Angeles with Barack Obama and Hollywood celebrities, along with a $8 million backyard fundraiser at the home of Terry McAuliffe. The combination of Trump's improved fundraising and Biden's increased spending on television ads were noted to give Trump a cash advantage by summer 2024.[140]\n\nIn the weeks following his widely considered poor debate performance on June 27, The New York Times reported that numerous large donors had \"slammed their wallets closed\" setting the campaign on track to raise half of what it had hoped for.[141] Major Democratic donors to the pro-Biden Super PAC Future Forward were reported to be privately withholding $90 million in pledges unless Biden stepped down from the Democratic ticket.[142] Following his withdrawal from the race, the Biden campaign's finances were transferred to the Kamala Harris 2024 presidential campaign.[143]\n\nCampaign events\n\nOn January 5, 2024, Biden held his first campaign rally for the year. Described as an unofficial campaign kickoff near Valley Forge, Pennsylvania,[144] the event previewed Biden's campaign theme of defending democracy and labeling Trump as a danger to democracy.[7]\n\nOn January 8, 2024, Biden held his second campaign speech of the year at Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, location of the 2015 Charleston church shooting, to speak against white supremacism and compared Donald Trump and his supporters to defeated Confederates after the Civil War supporting a \"second lost cause\" around denying the results of the 2020 election.[145]\n\nOn March 28, 2024, Biden held a large campaign event with former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton at Radio City Music Hall in New York City and announced raising over $26 million,[146] a record for a single political event.[147]\n\nOn June 27, 2024, Biden debated Trump in the Joe Biden\u2013Donald Trump 2024 presidential debate. Following the debate, CNN reported criticism of Biden's performance by some Democrats, with one Democratic strategist dubbing it a \"disaster\" and another as \"nothing good\".[148] His performance led to an increase in questions over Biden's health and age, and whether or not he should remain as the presidential candidate for the Democratic Party.[149][150]\n\nDemocratic primaries\n\nBiden faced opposition during the 2024 Democratic Party presidential primaries from U.S. Representative Dean Phillips. Biden was not on the ballot on January 23, New Hampshire primary, but won the state in a write-in campaign with 63.8% of the vote and strongly defeated Representative Phillips, who garnered 19.6% of the vote.[151] Biden had wanted South Carolina to be the first primary, and won that state on February 3 with 96% of the vote.[152] Biden received 89.3% of the vote in Nevada and 81.1% of the vote in Michigan, with \"None of these Candidates\" and \"Uncommitted\" coming in second, respectively. On Super Tuesday 2024, Biden won 15 of 16 contests, netting 80% or more of the primary vote in 13 of the 16 contests.[153][154] Biden lost the American Samoa contest to venture capitalist Jason Palmer, becoming the first incumbent president to lose a contest while appearing on the ballot since Jimmy Carter in 1980.[155][156] On March 6, Representative Phillips suspended his campaign and endorsed Biden.[157] On March 12, with wins in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington, he reached the 1,968 delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination, becoming the presumptive nominee.[158]\n\nEndorsements\n\nOpposition among Arab and Muslim Americans\n\nA protestor in Columbus, Ohio, carrying a sign referring to Biden as \"Genocide Joe\"\n\nIn reaction to the Biden administration's response to the Israel\u2013Hamas war, a vocal minority of progressives,[159] Muslim, and Arab American leaders have disrupted events and formed protest votes in swing states through the #AbandonBiden campaign, which encourages voters in the United States to not vote for Biden as a form of protest of his support for Israel.[160][161] The organization leaders said they would not support Donald Trump, but would not vote for Biden either.[162] On December 30, 2023, the #AbandonBiden campaign announced its countrywide expansion.[163] James Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute, argued that Arab American opposition to Biden was due to his \"insensitivity\" to Palestinian suffering.[164] Biden voiced support for the right to protest but criticized when they became violent or antisemitic.[165]\n\nBiden's support of Israel has prompted opposition from Muslim Americans and Arab Americans, particularly in Michigan, which has a large Muslim population and a large Arab population.[166][167] Mayor Abdullah Hammoud of Dearborn refused to meet with Biden's campaign in January 2024 because he said the lives of Palestinians are not measured in poll numbers.[168] Hammoud later joined 30 state legislators and members of the Wayne County Commission to put pressure on Biden.[169] U.S. Representative Rashida Tlaib, the only Palestinian American in Congress, also called for Michigan Democrats to vote \"uncommitted\" in the state primary.[170][171][172] Due to Michigan's status as a swing state, some analysts have said that Biden's support of Israel could cause him to lose not only the state, but also the election.[173][174] Some major Democratic Party donors criticized Biden's policies in Gaza, saying they were imperiling his presidential bid.[175] By May 2024, several progressive groups critical of Biden's Gaza policy began anti-Trump campaigns that were noted to indirectly help Biden.[176]\n\nWithdrawal\n\nCalls to withdraw\n\nBiden announcing that he will not run for re-election\n\nBiden faced calls from both pundits and fellow Democrats to withdraw from the race due to concerns about his health and age, his polling numbers against Republican presumptive nominee Donald Trump, and his low approval ratings, which have stayed below 44% since August 2021.[177][178] On a couple of occasions during the 2020 campaign Biden called himself a \"bridge candidate\", leading some to believe he would not seek a second term.[179] When Biden first took office at the age of 78 on January 20, 2021, he became the oldest person to have served as president of the United States.[180] Calls from Biden supporters to step aside months or years before the debate were made by James Carville,[181] Ezra Klein,[182] and the Economist.[183] On July 28, 2022, U.S. Representative Dean Phillips became the first incumbent Democratic member of Congress to say President Biden should not run for re-election and called for \"generational change,\" pointing to Biden's age.[184] Suggestions on who could replace Biden include Kamala Harris,[185] and governors Gavin Newsom of California, Jared Polis of Colorado, J. B. Pritzker of Illinois, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan.[186][187] On October 27, 2023, Minnesota Congressman Dean Phillips formally launched his presidential campaign for the Democratic nomination. Phillips argued during his campaign that the president would be a weak general election candidate due to his age and low approval ratings.[188] Biden and his campaign have deflected these concerns, demonstrating that he intends to stay in the race.[189] Jaime Harrison, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, called the idea of replacing Biden \"certifiably crazy\" in a tweet in February 2024.[190] By March 2024, the majority of Democratic officials, politicians, and strategists coalesced around Biden as their nominee,[159] especially following his 2024 State of the Union Address.[191]\n\nAfter a widely perceived poor performance during the first 2024 presidential debate on June 27, several Democratic officials and political pundits called on Biden to step aside as the nominee.[192][193] Other prominent Democrats, including former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton as well as Senators John Fetterman,[194][195] Bernie Sanders,[196][197] Tammy Duckworth,[195] and Chris Coons[198][195] rallied behind Biden, and resisted calls for him to step down due to one \"bad debate.\"[199] Other influential Democrats[200] and the editorial boards including The New York Times,[201] The Boston Globe,[202] the Chicago Tribune,[203] The New Yorker,[204] The Economist[178][204] and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution[205] called for Biden to suspend his presidential campaign. The New Republic described a widespread view among voters that Biden should step aside.[206]\n\nResponse by Biden\n\nBiden repudiated any possibility of him dropping out, saying only \"the Lord Almighty\" could convince him to drop out in an interview with ABC News held on July 5, after the first debate. Biden further affirmed his intent on staying in the race at a campaign rally in Madison, Wisconsin.[213] On July 5, Biden met with Democratic governors across the country with the majority saying he should also remain in the race.[213] He wrote a letter to Congressional Democrats on July 8, reiterating that he would not end his candidacy.[214] The same day, he called in to the MSNBC show Morning Joe and called for any prospective challengers to \"run against me. Announce for president, challenge me at the convention.\u201d[215] On July 11, Biden responded to a question whether he would step aside if polling data showed Kamala had a better chance of beating Trump by saying that he would only step aside if he had zero chance of beating Trump.[216]\n\nConferences\n\nThe Washington Post reported that U.S. Senator Mark Warner of Virginia was attempting to assemble a group of Democratic Senators to pressure Biden to withdraw from the race.[217] On July 7, top Democrats, including minority house leader Hakeem Jeffries, held a rare party conference on the matter.[218] On July 9, the full House Democratic Caucus and the Senate Democratic Caucus each held respective meetings to discuss Biden's place on the ticket.[219]\n\nOn July 11, 2024, Biden held an hour-long solo press conference following the NATO 2024 Washington summit in order to demonstrate his capability to face Donald Trump in the 2024 election.[220] Notably, Biden made two major gaffes, mistakenly introducing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as \"President Putin\",[221] and then accidentally referring to Vice President Kamala Harris as \"Vice President Trump.\"[222] Later that evening House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries met with Biden expressing \"the full breadth of insight, heartfelt perspectives and conclusions about the path forward that the Caucus\" discussed earlier in the week.[223]\n\nOn July 13, 2024, following the attempted assassination of Donald Trump, Biden campaign officials promised to limit public campaign messaging and take down all TV campaign advertisements as soon as possible.[224]\n\nAnnouncement of withdrawal\n\nOn July 21, following weeks of public and private pressure, Biden announced that he was withdrawing from the race, writing \"It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President. And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term\". He endorsed Harris as his replacement.[225]\n\nMy Fellow Americans, Over the past three and a half years, we have made great progress as a Nation. Today, America has the strongest economy in the world. We've made historic investments in rebuilding our Nation, in lowering prescription drug costs for seniors, and in expanding affordable health care to a record number of Americans. We've provided critically needed care to a million veterans exposed to toxic substances. Passed the first gun safety law in 30 years. Appointed the first African American woman to the Supreme Court. And passed the most significant climate legislation in the history of the world. America has never been better positioned to lead than we are today. I know none of this could have been done without you, the American people. Together, we overcame a once in a century pandemic and the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. We've protected and preserved our Democracy. And we've revitalized and strengthened our alliances around the world. It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President. And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term. I will speak to the Nation later this week in more detail about my decision. For now, let me express my deepest gratitude to all those who have worked so hard to see me reelected. I want to thank Vice President Kamala Harris for being an extraordinary partner in all this work. And let me express my heartfelt appreciation to the American people for the faith and trust you have placed in me. I believe today what I always have: that there is nothing America can't do - when we do it together. We just have to remember we are the United States of America. \u2014 Joe Biden\n\nOn the evening of July 24, Biden addressed the nation from the Oval Office, explaining his decision to withdraw from the race, and outlining his priorities for the final months of his term.[226]\n\nPolling\n\nPrimary election\n\nGeneral election\n\nSee also",

        "text": "Venezuela election: Maduro declared winner in disputed vote\nVenezuela's Maduro declared winner in disputed vote\n\nVenezuela election: Maduro declared winner in disputed vote\n\nPresident Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has won Venezuela's presidential election, according to partial results announced by the electoral council. The head of the National Electoral Council (CNE), Elvis Amoroso - who is a close ally of Mr Maduro - said that with 80% of ballots counted, President Maduro had 51% of the vote, compared to 44% for his main rival. The Venezuelan opposition dismissed the CNE's announcement as fraudulent and promised to challenge the result. It said its candidate, Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez, had won with 70% of the votes and insisted he was the rightful president-elect.\n\nThe opposition said vote tallies it had received, as well as quick counts, showed Mr Gonz\u00e1lez had a lead of 40 percentage points over the incumbent. Opposition parties had united behind Mr Gonz\u00e1lez in an attempt to unseat President Maduro after 11 years in power. Opinion polls conducted ahead of the election had suggested Mr Gonz\u00e1lez would roundly defeat the president.\n\nReuters Opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado said Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez was the rightful president-elect\n\nThe result of the election will have repercussions well beyond the South American country of 29.4 million inhabitants. Over the past 10 years, 7.8 million people have fled Venezuela because of the economic and political crisis into which the country was plunged under the Maduro Administration. Polls conducted in the run-up to the election suggest that exodus could now increase, with one poll suggesting a third of the population would emigrate. With immigration a hot topic in the US election, the government in Washington, as well as Latin American nations to which Venezuelans have emigrated en masse, are affected by what happens in the Andean country. Who Venezuela does business with also matters because it has the world's biggest oil reserve. Mr Maduro blames US sanctions for his country's economic woes and has forged close alliances with China, Iran, and Russia - nations which also have a thorny relationship with the US. A change of government could see Venezuela turn away from these countries as well as from its close ally, Cuba, while Mr Maduro is expected to deepen his ties with his allies should he stay in power. Many Venezuelans were adamant that they wanted change after 25 years in which the socialist PSUV party has been in power - first under the leadership of the late President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, and after his death from cancer in 2013, under Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. In the queue at one polling station in Petare, a poor neighbourhood in the capital, Caracas, many people said they were voting for \u201cchange\u201d. \u201cThis government has had all the opportunities to make Venezuela a great country, but instead we have misery,\u201d a voter called Paulo told BBC reporter Ione Wells. \u201cOur children have to go through a jungle, the Dari\u00e9n Gap, to the US. There are many dead Venezuelans in the jungle. Our children are dying.\u201d There was widespread fear that the government could resort to fraud to win the election. Mr Maduro's win in 2018 was also widely dismissed as neither free nor fair. However, the opposition had hoped its lead would be so convincing, it would thwart any attempts by the Maduro administration to \"steal the election\". One community leader, Katiuska Camargo, said for many years people did not turn out in such large numbers because \u201cthere was so much collective disappointment\" but that now people were \"determined that these people leave power immediately\".\n\nGetty In Caracas, a group of opposition supporters held hands in protest to be let in to count the votes",

        "text": "Venezuela standoff as Maduro declared winner of presidential election but opposition claims landslide victory\nCaracas, Venezuela \u2014 Venezuela's opposition claimed victory in Sunday's presidential election, setting up a showdown with the government, which earlier declared President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro the winner.\n\n\"Venezuelans and the entire world know what happened,\" opposition candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez said in his first remarks.\n\nOpposition leader Maria Corina Machado said the margin of Gonz\u00e1lez's victory was \"overwhelming\" based on voting tallies it had received from campaign representatives from about 40% of ballot boxes nationwide.\n\nOpposition leader Maria Corina Machado and presidential candidate Edmundo Gonzalez hold a press conference after electoral authorities declared President Nicolas Maduro the winner of the presidential election in Caracas, Venezuela, on July 29, 2024. Matias Delacroix / AP\n\nThe National Electoral Council, which is controlled by Maduro loyalists, earlier said Maduro had secured 51% of the vote to 44% for Gonz\u00e1lez. But it didn't release the tallies from each of the 30,000 polling booths nationwide, only promising to do so in the \"coming hours,\" hampering the ability to verify the results.\n\nOther nations voice doubts about official results\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, speaking in Tokyo, said the U.S. has \"serious concerns that the result announced does not reflect the will or the votes of the Venezuelan people.\"\n\nForeign leaders held off recognizing the results.\n\n\"The Maduro regime should understand that the results it published are difficult to believe,\" said Gabriel Boric, the leftist leader of Chile. \"We won't recognize any result that is not verifiable.\"\n\nGuatemalan President Bernardo Arevalo said, \"We receive the results announced by the CNE (electoral authority) with many doubts,\" the Reuters news agency reports.\n\nReuters quotes Uruguayan President Luis Lacalle Pou as saying, \"It was an open secret. They were going to 'win' regardless of the actual results.\"\n\nItaly and Spain were among other countries indicating concern about the truth of the announced official results.\n\nBut China congratulated Maduro on his win, and Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel said he spoke with Maduro to congratulate him on his \"historic\" victory, according to Agence France-Presse.\n\nThe delay in announcing results - six hours after polls were supposed to close - indicated a deep debate inside the government about how to proceed after Maduro's opponents came out early in the evening all but claiming victory.\n\nWhen Maduro finally came out to celebrate the results, he accused unidentified foreign enemies of trying to hack the voting system.\n\n\"This is not the first time that they have tried to violate the peace of the republic,\" he said to a few hundred supporters at the presidential palace. He provided no evidence to back the claim but promised \"justice\" for those who try to stir violence in Venezuela.\n\nPresident Nicolas Maduro addresses supporters gathered outside the Miraflores presidential palace after electoral authorities declared him the winner of the presidential election in Caracas, Venezuela, on July 29, 2024. Fernando Vergara / AP\n\nMaduro, in seeking a third term, faced his toughest challenge yet from the unlikeliest of opponents in Gonz\u00e1lez: a retired diplomat who was unknown to voters before being tapped in April as a last-minute stand-in for Machado, considered a powerhouse.\n\nEarlier, opposition supporters celebrated, online and outside a few voting centers, what they assured was a landslide victory for Gonz\u00e1lez.\n\n\"I'm so happy,\" said Merling Fern\u00e1ndez, a 31-year-old bank employee, as a representative for the opposition campaign walked out of one voting center in a working class neighborhood of Caracas to announce results showing Gonz\u00e1lez more than doubling Maduro's vote count. Dozens standing nearby erupted in an impromptu rendition of the national anthem.\n\n\"This is the path toward a new Venezuela,\" added Fern\u00e1ndez, holding back tears. \"We are all tired of this yoke.\"\n\nVoters started lining up at some voting centers across the country before dawn Sunday, sharing water, coffee and snacks for several hours.\n\nResults will have broad impact\n\nThe election will have ripple effects throughout the Americas, with government opponents and supporters alike signaling their interest in joining the exodus of 7.7 million Venezuelans who have already left their homes for opportunities abroad in anticipation of Maduro winning another six year term.\n\nAuthorities set Sunday's election to coincide with what would have been the 70th birthday of former President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, the revered leftist firebrand who died of cancer in 2013, leaving his Bolivarian revolution in the hands of Maduro. But Maduro and his United Socialist Party of Venezuela are more unpopular than ever among many voters who blame his policies for crushing wages, spurring hunger, crippling the oil industry and separating families due to migration.\n\nThe opposition managed to line up behind a single candidate after years of intraparty divisions and election boycotts that torpedoed their ambitions to topple the ruling party.\n\nMachado was blocked by the Maduro-controlled supreme court from running for any office for 15 years. A former lawmaker, she swept the opposition's October primary with over 90% of the vote. After she was prevented from joining the presidential race, she chose a college professor as her substitute on the ballot, but the National Electoral Council also barred her from registering. That's when Gonz\u00e1lez, a political newcomer, was chosen.\n\nSunday's ballot also featured eight other candidates challenging Maduro, but only Gonz\u00e1lez threatens Maduro's rule.\n\nAfter voting, Maduro said he would recognize the election result and urged all other candidates to publicly declare that they would do the same.\n\n\"No one is going to create chaos in Venezuela,\" Maduro said. \"I recognize and will recognize the electoral referee, the official announcements and I will make sure they are recognized.\"\n\nEconomy central in unrest \u2014 and election\n\nVenezuela sits atop the world's largest proven oil reserves, and once boasted Latin America's most advanced economy. But it entered into a freefall after Maduro took the helm. Plummeting oil prices, widespread shortages and hyperinflation that soared past 130,000% led first to social unrest and then to mass emigration.\n\nEconomic sanctions from the U.S. seeking to force Maduro from power after his 2018 reelection - which the U.S. and dozens of other countries condemned as illegitimate - only deepened the crisis.\n\nMaduro's pitch to voters this election was one of economic security, which he tried to sell with stories of entrepreneurship and references to a stable currency exchange and lower inflation rates. The International Monetary Fund forecasts the economy will grow 4% this year - one of the fastest in Latin America - after having shrunk 71% from 2012 to 2020.\n\nBut most Venezuelans haven't seen any improvement in their quality of life. Many earn under $200 a month, which means families struggle to afford essential items. Some work second and third jobs. A basket of basic staples - sufficient to feed a family of four for a month - costs an estimated $385.\n\nThe opposition has tried to seize on the huge inequalities arising from the crisis, during which Venezuelans abandoned their country's currency, the bolivar, for the U.S. dollar.\n\nGonz\u00e1lez and Machado focused much of their campaigning on Venezuela's vast hinterland, where the economic activity seen in Caracas in recent years didn't materialize. They promised a government that would create sufficient jobs to attract Venezuelans living abroad to return home and reunite with their families.",

        "text": "News Bureau\nJungHwan Yang, a professor of communication at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, is a co-principal investigator on a research project and a website \u2014 socialpolls.org \u2014 that examine the informal polls about the U.S. presidential election posted on the social media platform X, formerly called Twitter. Yang spoke with News Bureau research editor Sharita Forrest about the project.\n\nSocial media users may be exposed to numerous informal polls during the election. How much faith should they place in the results?\n\nWe examined nearly 2,000 polls posted on X that ostensibly gauged support for U.S. presidential candidates during the 2016 and 2020 elections.\n\nWhile social media polls appear like traditional opinion surveys, they are not accurate measures of public opinion. Instead, they are indicators of political engagement among specific subsets of the population and serve a distinct function.\n\nThis distinction is important because the observed opinions on social media are inherently biased.\n\nWhat are some of ways in which social media polls are biased?\n\nWe found that these polls are biased in terms of their content, authorship and audience.\n\nFirst, they are not scientific. Traditional polls are carefully designed as to who is asked the questions and how the surveys are distributed. Social media polls are purely based on people\u2019s voluntary engagement because they are not asking questions of a representative sample of the electorate.\n\nFor example, if former President Donald Trump is posting a poll, it is very likely that his followers will vote rather than people who do not follow him.\n\nBased on certain events, the level of public engagement also can change drastically. For example, the failed assassination attempt on Trump could mobilize his supporters on a social media platform.\n\nSometimes the survey questions are biased. Creators do not ask the question in an objective way because they want a certain outcome.\n\nBy amplifying some negative aspects of a candidate, they can also skew the responses. For example, they might have asked, \u201cSince Joe Biden\u2019s cognitive health is deteriorating, who do you think the next president of the United States should be?\u201d\n\nAnd the inclusion of a third or fourth candidate in a multiple-choice format can change the results, as can the order of the questions and the responses.\n\nWhat have you found in your research about those who create these polls?\n\nWe scraped data from each poll\u2019s author profile as well as those of their followers. We collected all the profiles of poll authors and their followers who retweeted and tagged each poll as a favorite. Finally, we used machine learning algorithms coupled with human verification to identify these social media users\u2019 demographic and political characteristics.\n\nThe social media polls in the 2016 and 2020 election cycles were predominantly crafted by younger males. That said, polls won by Trump were more likely to be crafted by older users than polls won by Biden/Clinton.\n\nThose who post these social media polls control when they put them on sites and when they close the posts, giving them a lot of control over generating the results they want.\n\nYour study indicates that the creators of these polls purchase votes from bot farms overseas. How prevalent is that? And do social media companies \u2014 some of which claim they block false information \u2014 address it?\n\nIt is common to see social media polls accumulate thousands of votes very quickly.\n\nBot farms and astroturfing campaigns can create fake accounts that follow the instructions of the people who purchase their services. Bad actors who want a certain outcome can buy a lot of votes from bots. As far as we know, social media companies do not monitor these activities and are not transparent about the extent to which this occurs on their platforms.\n\nFalse impressions created by social polls can reduce the quality of political information on social media and further erode trust in these platforms.\n\nHow do these polls affect social media users\u2019 perceptions of the election information reported by mainstream media?\n\nIn a second study we found that some poll questions allude to mistrust in mainstream media. For example, the poll authors might say, \u201cGiven that the traditional media polls are biased, let\u2019s measure the real public opinion with this.\u201d Poll questions hint about conspiracies with voter fraud, rigged elections and follow that kind of narrative.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge the potential impact of these polls in general discussions among the public and in the media. We know that many conservative people in the U.S. have very low trust in mainstream media and information coming from them \u2014 but they trust the social polls they engage with.\n\nFor example, they might think \u201cI voted on an X poll last week, and in that poll, Trump is winning by 75%. But in the poll published in The New York Times, Trump\u2019s winning by only 55% \u2014 so mainstream media are biased.\u201d\n\nIf you consider all the things happening right now in the media, the government, politics and social media, this can be impactful.\n\nWhat is the purpose of the Social Polls website your team created?\n\nThe Social Polls website is a platform to communicate our research findings to the public. We are examining polls conducted over social media to see how the results change daily. We also publish social media poll results after we adjust for bias using sample reweighting methods. And we are constantly updating as we approach the election.\n\nThere is a similar website called fivethirtyeight.com, which was founded by statistician Nate Silver.",

        "text": "Carter Center Statement on Venezuela Election\n(en Espa\u00f1ol)\n\nATLANTA \u2014 Venezuela\u2019s 2024 presidential election did not meet international standards of electoral integrity and cannot be considered democratic.\n\nThe Carter Center cannot verify or corroborate the results of the election declared by the National Electoral Council (CNE), and the electoral authority\u2019s failure to announce disaggregated results by polling station constitutes a serious breach of electoral principles.\n\nVenezuela's electoral process did not meet international standards of electoral integrity at any of its stages and violated numerous provisions of its own national laws. The election took place in an environment of restricted freedoms for political actors, civil society organizations, and the media. Throughout the electoral process, the CNE demonstrated a clear bias in favor of the incumbent.\n\nVoter registration was hurt by short deadlines, relatively few places of registration, and minimal public information. Citizens abroad faced excessive legal requirements to register, some of which appeared to be arbitrary. This effectively disenfranchised most of the migrant population, resulting in very low numbers of voters abroad.\n\nThe registration of parties and candidates also did not meet international standards. Over the past few years, several opposition parties have had their registrations changed to leaders who favor the government. This influenced the nomination of some opposition candidates. Importantly, the registration of the candidacy of the main opposition forces was subject to arbitrary decisions of the CNE, without respecting basic legal principles.\n\nThe electoral campaign was impacted by unequal conditions among candidates. The campaign of the incumbent president was well funded and widely visible through rallies, posters, murals, and street campaigning. The abuse of administrative resources on behalf of the incumbent \u2014 including use of government vehicles, public officials campaigning while in their official capacity, and use of social programs \u2014 was observed throughout the campaign.\n\nThe incumbent also enjoyed overwhelming positive coverage on television and radio, in terms of advertising, broadcast events, and news coverage, while the primary opposition candidate received little media coverage. In addition, authorities frequently attempted to restrict the opposition\u2019s campaign activities. This included harassment or intimidation of people who provided services or goods to the main opposition campaign.\n\nStill, Venezuelan citizens turned out peacefully and in large numbers to express their will on election day. Despite reports of restrictions on access to many polling centers for domestic observers and opposition party witnesses; potential pressure on the voters, such as ruling party checkpoints in the vicinity of voting centers; and incidents of tension or violence reported in some localities; voting appeared to take place in a generally civil manner.\n\nIn the limited number of polling centers they visited, Carter Center observer teams noted the desire of the Venezuelan people to participate in a democratic election process, as demonstrated through their active participation as polling staff, party witnesses, and citizen observers. However, their efforts were undermined by the CNE's complete lack of transparency in announcing the results.\n\nTranslation\n\nDeclaraci\u00f3n del Centro Carter Sobre la Elecci\u00f3n en Venezuela (PDF)\n\n***\n\nAbout the Carter Center technical election observation mission in Venezuela\n\nThe Carter Center was invited by the CNE to observe the presidential election in March 2024 and signed a memorandum of understanding to guarantee that the mission could observe freely in accordance with the Center\u2019s standard methodology. The Carter Center deployed 17 experts and observers starting on June 29, including teams based in Caracas, Barinas, Maracaibo, and Valencia. The mission met with a wide range of stakeholders, including the CNE, candidates, political parties, civil society organizations, citizen observation groups, media representatives, government officials, armed forces, and election experts. Given its limited numbers, the Carter Center\u2019s direct observations were limited, especially on election day.\n\nThe Center has observed 124 elections in 43 nations and is committed to impartial and independent election observation that provides transparency in election processes with the objective of encouraging processes that meet international standards for democratic elections. The Carter Center will publish a final report of its observation mission, documenting the findings indicated in this statement.",

        "text": "Who could Kamala Harris pick as her vice-presidential candidate?\nWho could be Kamala Harris's running mate?\n\nGetty Images Josh Shapiro, Tim Walz and Mark Kelly\n\nNow that Vice-President Kamala Harris is closing in on the Democratic nomination to take on Republican Donald Trump, talk has turned to her running mate. She will need to pick one by the time Democratic party delegates vote next month at a convention in Chicago to officially confirm who is on the ticket. A team to vet the people in the frame has been reportedly appointed to explore who might best stand up to the scrutiny of the national spotlight. Historically, vice-presidents are picked to complement a candidate and strategists believe for that reason she may pick a white man from a battleground state. Here's a bit on the names reported to be in the mix, with an assessment of their chances by North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher.\n\nJosh Shapiro, Pennsylvania governor\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe charismatic governor of Pennsylvania, a state that many think is essentially must-win for Harris, has oratory skills which have drawn comparisons with Barack Obama. He would be the first Jewish vice-president and has peeled off Republican voters in his home state. Shapiro has seen high approval ratings since he was elected in 2022 in a swing state Trump narrowly carried in 2016. He made national headlines last year after quickly rebuilding a collapsed bridge on a crucial Philadelphia highway - a major political victory for a first-term governor. The speedy repair was hailed by many as the perfect infrastructure talking point for a potential 2028 presidential candidate. Anthony Zurcher: He could help lock down an important - perhaps the most important - state for Ms Harris. But his outspoken support of Israel during the Gaza War and his criticism of student protests in his state might open up divisions within the Democratic Party that the vice-president is keen to avoid.\n\nTim Walz, Minnesota governor\n\nReuters\n\nThe 60-year-old served 12 years as a US congressman before his successful 2018 run to lead the state. His performance as governor was thrust into the national spotlight when he sent in the National Guard to deal with mass protests after the death of George Floyd. He himself had a 20-year service in the National Guard before his political career, a time when he also taught at a high school and worked as an assistant football coach. When asked whether he would serve as Ms Harris' running mate, Mr Walz told CNN's State of the Union: \u201cI would do what is in the best interest of the country.\" He dodged the question when asked if he received vetting materials. AZ: Minnesota may not be a top-line battleground state, but Tim Walz has the small-town Midwestern sensibilities to give him some cross-border appeal. While he governs from the left, his plainspoken manner and religious convictions give him a moderate sheen.\n\nMark Kelly, Arizona senator\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe former astronaut and Navy combat pilot has an all-action edge, while his strong border stance and occasional criticisms of the Biden administration could be eye-catching for floating conservative voters. His Democratic superstar wife Gabby Giffords, who was shot in a mass shooting, gives him a personal story as strong as his CV. The former House congresswoman was seriously wounded and has become one of the leading voices on gun safety laws. With gun violence a major campaign issue for Democrats, Mr Kelly\u2019s personal story could resonate with voters. AZ: Mark Kelly is from a state that Democrats would love to keep in their column. His selection would create challenges down the road, however, as Democrats would have to gear up for another pivotal Senate campaign to hold his seat in a special election in 2026.\n\nAndy Beshear, Kentucky governor\n\nGetty Images\n\nMr Beshear has carved out a successful career as the Democratic leader of a deep-red state, which voted for Trump by a margin of more than 25 percentage points in 2020. That year he became the only Democratic governor to win in a Trump state, helped by the state's booming pre-Covid economy. Supporting public education and protecting reproductive rights are also key issues for him. Kamala Harris and he have been close for a long time so there would be no question marks about chemistry if picked as her running mate. The most youthful of those in the frame can help Harris underline the generation gap with the top of the Republican ticket. And he\u2019s not afraid of talking about his Christian faith and its impact on his personality and work, something that might endear him to parts of America beyond Harris\u2019s reach. Mr Beshear dodged reporters' questions in Georgia when asked if he was being vetted to serve as Harris' running mate. AZ: Andy Beshear has proven himself adept at winning support in a state that is dominated by Republicans and voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump in 2020. He\u2019s the son of a popular former Kentucky governor, though, which gave him electoral advantages he might not be able to reproduce nationally.\n\nJB Pritzker, Illinois governor\n\nGetty Images\n\nJB Pritzker, the governor of Illinois, has raised his profile in recent years by going after Trump and defending Mr Biden. The billionaire businessman - heir to the Hyatt hotel chain - is quick to post criticism of Trump on social media. After the debate he called Trump a \"liar\" and said he is a \"34-count convicted felon who cares only about himself\". Like Ms Whitmer, Mr Pritzker has a track record of completing agenda items on left-wing Democrats' to-do lists on issues like abortion rights and gun control. He also dodged questions on ABC about whether he was being vetted to serve as the vice-presidential candidate. AZ: He has a blunt Chicago manner that lends an air of everyman authenticity to his politics. Coming from deeply Democratic Illinois, however, may limit his appeal in the mid-western swing states - particularly given Ms Harris\u2019s liberal California background.\n\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg\n\nGetty Images\n\nIt is no secret that Pete Buttigieg has presidential aspirations. He ran in 2020 and is often touted as one of the Biden administration's best communicators. Mr Buttigieg has managed a number of public crises during his time as transportation secretary. He helped to oversee the government response to the East Palestine train derailment in Ohio, the Baltimore Bridge collapse and Southwest Airlines' scheduling crisis in 2022. Mr Buttigieg stated on X, formerly Twitter, that Mr Biden had \"earned his place among the best and most consequential presidents in American history\". He said he would do \"all that I can to help elect Kamala Harris the next President\". AZ: Pete Buttigieg was the surprise hit of the 2020 Democratic presidential race, generating a loyal following that is still with him. His ability to adeptly define and defend the party\u2019s priorities, even in hostile territory like Fox News, could be a useful skill for a running mate.\n\nOther possible candidates?",

While the current administration has prioritized scrutinizing M&A deal, we could see a different approach from a new administration.\n\nThe potential impacts of the U.S. election on M&A are further explored in an article from the Q3 Torys Quarterly titled \u201cU.S. M&A outlook and the 2024 election\u201d. \u201cCommon wisdom among dealmakers is that U.S. presidential elections have more of an effect on deal timing than deal outcomes,\u201d the article says. For example, the volume of deals in the third quarter of presidential election years are typically lower than in non-election years; however, in the first quarter following the election, deals tend to \u201cspike by approximately the same amount that they were depressed prior to the election.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis \u2018dip and recovery\u2019 pattern suggests that some deals are delayed to allow parties to adjust deals for election outcomes\u2014but that most ultimately go through in some form, regardless of the election outcome,\u201d the article explains.\n\nLearn more about our M&A work on our practice page.",

        "text": "Marianne Williamson 2024 presidential campaign\nAmerican political campaign\n\nMarianne Williamson, an author, political activist, and candidate for the Democratic Party presidential nomination in 2020, announced her campaign for the 2024 United States presidential election on March 4, 2023.[8] Williamson was the first major Democratic candidate to officially announce their candidacy,[9][10] as President Joe Biden did not announce his re-election bid until April 2023.[11] Williamson suspended her campaign on February 7, 2024, as a result of her losses in the New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada Democratic primaries. She later retracted her campaign suspension and officially rejoined the race on February 28, 2024, following her third place finish in the Michigan Democratic primary ahead of Dean Phillips, whose campaign was still active at the time. On June 11, 2024, Williamson announced her decision to suspend her campaign again. On July 2, 2024, Williamson again announced her decision to resume her campaign following calls for Biden to drop out after his performance at the June 27 presidential debate. On July 29, 2024, Williamson announced she did not file a run against Harris in the planned virtual roll call vote, ending her campaign.\n\nBackground [ edit ]\n\nWilliamson first ran for office in the 2014 U.S. House elections, seeking to represent California's 33rd congressional district as an independent. She placed third in the nonpartisan blanket primary and did not advance to the general election.[12] She later ran a campaign for the 2020 Democratic Party presidential nomination.[13] She formally ended her campaign on January 10, 2020,[14] endorsing Bernie Sanders and then Joe Biden as the nominee.[15][16]\n\nCampaign [ edit ]\n\nWilliamson speaking at a campaign event in Nashua, New Hampshire.\n\nAnnouncement and launch [ edit ]\n\nOn February 18, 2023, Williamson confirmed she would make \"an important announcement\" in Washington, D.C., on March 4 regarding the 2024 presidential election.[17] In an interview with Politico published the day before she teased the announcement, she said if she were to run, she would remain with the Democratic Party, in an apparent move to set up a primary challenge against incumbent President Joe Biden; she stated a factor into her decision would be to address what she described as Biden's \"message that the economy is getting stronger\".[18]\n\nWilliamson formally announced her candidacy in a twenty-minute speech she delivered at Union Station.[19] Facing steep competition in the primary against an incumbent, several journalists and commentators have deemed her campaign a \"long shot\".[20] Some Williamson supporters have criticized the media for focusing on their view of her as a long shot candidate, rather than on the substance of her platform.[21][better source needed][22][better source needed]\n\nIn late November 2023, Williamson and fellow Biden challengers, Dean Phillips and Cenk Uygur, claimed they were unfairly disqualified from getting on the Florida Democratic Party primary ballot, which the party discounted.[23] The following week, the underdog trio arranged to appear together and respond to the Republican candidates' December 6 debate and discuss their policy positions on Uygur's The Young Turks (TYT) network.[24][25]\n\nStaff relations [ edit ]\n\nWilliamson's campaign has had trouble with maintaining relations with her staff. In March 2023, Politico published a report detailing Williamson's alleged abuses towards her staffers on her 2020 campaign. The staffers, who remained anonymous due to having signed non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), described a toxic work environment. One reported it as, \"It would be foaming, spitting, uncontrollable rage.\" \"It was traumatic. And the experience, in the end, was terrifying.\" In contrast to her career message of love, she threw phones, some said, and shouted at them so intensely they were reduced to tears. Her anger over logistics in South Carolina had led her to strike a vehicle repeatedly, to the extent that her hand swelled so much she had to be transported for medical attention.[26] Williamson has called the article a \"distraction\" and a \"hit piece,\" but acknowledged she had room for personal growth.[27]\n\nOn May 20, 2023, Williamson's campaign manager Peter Daou announced via Twitter he was leaving the Williamson campaign,[28] citing a need to care for his and his wife's ailing parents,[29] and stating that he still \"believe[s] deeply in the campaign\u2019s platform.\"[30] Additionally, her deputy campaign manager Jason Call told Politico that he had resigned the day before, but refused to provide any more details.[28] In September 2023, Daou became the campaign manager for Cornel West's 2024 presidential run under the Green Party ticket.[31]\n\nIn June 2023, Williamson's second campaign manager, Roza Calderon, left the campaign, with a friend contending that Calderon had \"tried to right the ship and lead this campaign. Marianne knocked her down every chance she got.\"[32]\n\nIn early July 2023, six more staff members left the Williamson campaign in a mix of firings and resignations, which included her entire South Carolina team.[33] Reportedly, several staff members had been disappointed with Williamson about her lack of ballot access operations. Williamson announced a new book scheduled to come out in September 2023, which led one of the former staffers to call her campaign a \"grift\" for media attention to promote her new book.[34]\n\nIn January 2024, her third campaign manager, Carlos Cardona, resigned.[2]\n\nPrimaries [ edit ]\n\nWilliamson came in third place in the 2024 New Hampshire primary, with four percent of the vote.[35] Following the primary, she held a volunteer Zoom meeting where she announced a tentative decision to drop out of the race, but after the call was leaked to the X account OrganizerMemes, she decided to stay in.[36][37]\n\nShe received 2.1% of the vote, and zero delegates, in the 2024 South Carolina Democratic presidential primary on February 3, 2024,[38] which was the first state to earn delegates for Democratic candidates, as the New Hampshire primary was unsanctioned.[39] Williamson was on the ballot for the 2024 Nevada Democratic presidential primary on February 6, 2024, and received 3% of the vote causing her not win any delegates.[40]\n\nSuspensions and unsuspensions [ edit ]\n\nWilliamson suspended her campaign on February 7, 2024, following her losses in the New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada primaries, winning 5,016 votes (4.0%) in New Hampshire, 2,786 votes (2.1%) in South Carolina, and 3,909 votes (3.0%) in Nevada.[41]\n\nWilliamson announced on February 28, 2024, that she was \"unsuspending\" her presidential campaign following the over 100,000 votes for \"Uncommitted\" in the Michigan Democratic primary.[42][43]\n\nOn Super Tuesday, Williamson received about 200,000 of the more than six million votes cast. She was largely shut out of delegates, as she failed to break 15% of the vote in any states. Her best finishes were in Oklahoma, where she received 9.1% of the vote, and Virginia, where she received 7.8% of the vote.[citation needed]\n\nWilliamson announced on June 11 that she would leave the race.[44]\n\nOn July 2, Williamson reentered the race following criticism of Biden in the aftermath of his debate with Donald Trump.[45] Following Biden's suspension of his campaign and subsequent endorsement of Kamala Harris on July 21, Williamson continued calls for an open convention, arguing that the vice president should not be \"anointed to the position of nominee.\"[46]\n\nShe withdrew over a week later, on July 29, announcing that she did not file a run against Harris in the planned virtual roll call vote, ending her campaign.[47]\n\nPolitical positions [ edit ]\n\nDescribed as a progressive Democrat,[48] Williamson's policies are similar to those of her former 2020 rival Bernie Sanders,[49] whom she initially endorsed after exiting that race.[50] Sanders has likewise expressed praise for Williamson,[51] although he has endorsed Biden in the 2024 race.[52] According to ABC News, her priorities include free healthcare, free college, and free childcare.[53] Williamson promotes progressive and social democratic policies in the spirit of President Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal, such as a 21st Century Economic Bill of Rights[54] promoted by her friend, campaign advisor and FDR historian, Harvey J. Kaye and Alan Minsky of the Progressive Democrats of America (PDA).[55][56]\n\nWilliamson has called for creating a Department of Peace,[57] which would promote peace and diplomacy, as well as a Department of Children and Youth, which Williamson says are severely neglected and calls the current treatment of children by the government \"collective neglection\".[57] She believes the United States needs mass-mobilization in order to prevent a climate catastrophe.[58] She also supports certain proposed constitutional amendments, such as the Equal Rights Amendment and a proposed amendment to enshrine rights for individuals who identify as LGBTQ+.[59]\n\nWilliamson expressed support for universal-basic-income during her 2020[60][61] and 2024 presidential runs.[62]\n\nPolling [ edit ]\n\nIn opinion polling, Williamson typically averaged around the high single digits in national polls.[63] The highest poll number recorded was 13% which she received in a November Fox News poll.[64]\n\nEndorsements [ edit ]\n\nSome early supporters of Williamson include actor Keith David,[65] as well as political commentators Krystal Ball and Kyle Kulinski.[66]",

        "text": "Iran trying to undercut Trump campaign and Russia doing opposite, U.S. officials indicate\nIran has started an influence campaign designed to undercut the candidacy of former President Donald Trump, U.S. officials indicated Monday, in an apparent reprisal of a 2020 effort that U.S. intelligence agencies found with high confidence had been authorized by Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.\n\nThe update came from officials with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), FBI and Department of Homeland Security who held a joint election security briefing 99 days before Election Day. The briefing was the second in a series the agencies expect to give before that day, and the officials spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss sensitive assessments.\n\n\"Since our last update, the [intelligence community] has observed Tehran working to influence the presidential election, probably because Iranian leaders want to avoid an outcome they perceive would increase tensions with the United States,\" a senior ODNI official said, adding, \"Iran's preference is essentially a reflection of its desire to not worsen tensions with the United States, and Iran is opposing the candidate that Iran's leaders perceive would increase those tensions.\"\n\nThe officials did not explicitly name the Trump campaign and referred instead to the key findings of the 2020 assessment. They also stressed that most of Iran's online activities, which they said rely on a \"vast web\" of internet personas, have been focused on stoking chaos and societal divisions, including over the war in Gaza.\n\nThe officials who briefed reporters Monday declined to offer additional details on the extent to which Iran is backing Gaza-related protests in the U.S., an effort revealed earlier this month in a statement from Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines.\n\nIn the statement, issued on July 9, Haines said the intelligence community had \"observed actors tied to Iran's government posing as activists online seeking to encourage protests and even providing financial support to protesters.\"\n\n\"We can't comment on the scale of the activities,\" the ODNI official said Monday. \"We can say there is great concern given their efforts to engage U.S. persons directly in the activity or through another entity as a cutout.\"\n\nDifferent direction for Russia\n\nIran's efforts to undermine the Trump campaign appear for the moment to be at cross-purposes with simultaneous efforts by Russia to influence the election in Trump's favor, even as the two countries have forged closer ties over the course of the war in Ukraine. Biden administration officials revealed last year that Iranian is attempting to help Russia build a drone factory on Russian soil in exchange for military equipment.\n\nU.S. officials have indicated the Kremlin is again working in this election cycle to boost Trump's candidacy, as it did in 2016 and 2020, though they did not directly name his campaign.\n\n\"We have not observed a shift in Russia's preferences for the presidential race from past elections, given the role the U.S. is playing with regard to Ukraine and broader policy towards Russia,\" an ODNI official said in a July 9 election security update. The 2020 assessment noted Russian president Vladimir Putin authorized a range of operations aimed at denigrating the Biden campaign and supporting Trump, as well as stoking societal divisions among Americans.\n\nOn Monday, the senior ODNI official said Russia's efforts \"would not have been authorized or allowed without believing they're consistent with Putin's views.\"\n\n\"As to Iran, some of Iran's primary influence actors operate under the [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps], which has a direct line to the Supreme Leader,\" the official added.\n\nChina may be eyeing down-ballot races\n\nWhile China has the capability to wage similar influence campaigns, U.S. intelligence agencies do not currently believe Beijing will seek to meddle in the presidential race due to concern that would damage the already tenuous bilateral relationship. Officials are monitoring the potential, however, that actors linked to China may work to denigrate down-ballot candidates, according to Monday's update.\n\nGenerally, foreign actors are \"closely monitoring U.S. political developments, especially the events that occurred this month regarding the presidential race,\" the ODNI official said, though the briefers declined to discuss whether or how either the failed assassination attempt on Trump or Mr. Biden's decision to withdraw his candidacy had factored into any ongoing operations.\n\nOfficials also warned that Russia and China in particular have been enlisting commercial marketing and public relations firms to \"better hide their hand\" in influence efforts.\n\n\"Fundamentally, foreign countries are calculating that Americans are more likely to believe other Americans compared to content with clear signs of foreign propaganda,\" the ODNI official said. \"Foreign actors continue to rely on witting and unwitting Americans to seed, promote and add credibility to narratives that serve the foreign actors' interests.\"\n\nOfficials declined to specify where any of the firms are currently operating or whether U.S. law enforcement agencies had opened any investigations into their employees or operations.",

It is anticipated that for the first time, more than half of the global population will be eligible to vote.\nTo be eligible to vote in the US presidential election, you must be a US citizen. It is poised to be a critical election year in the US, with immigration remaining a hot campaign topic.\nThis blog discusses the process of becoming a US citizen (e.g., naturalization) and the benefits. Interested applicants are encouraged to proceed without delay. While the application process can be overwhelming, many resources can assist.\nNaturalization Overview\nNaturalization is the process of becoming an American citizen if you were born outside of the US. To be eligible for citizenship, you must meet the following criteria:\nProcessing times for naturalization applications can vary depending on where you live. During an election year, we have observed the immigration service accelerate processing times resulting in quicker approvals, making it a good time to apply.\nBenefits of Applying for US Citizenship\nUS citizens enjoy many benefits that are not available to lawful permanent residents (e.g., green card holders). Some of those benefits include:\nIn addition, policies surrounding international travel can be heavily influenced by the presidential elections, which can lead to uncertainty and unpredictability for lawful permanent residents.\nFor example, in 2020, former President Trump issued several executive orders restricting travel for visa holders and permanent residents (even in some emergency circumstances). While some of those orders were implemented due to the global pandemic, the suddenness by which some of the orders were issued left many people anxious and stranded. US citizens were (and continue to be) protected from these types of travel restrictions.\nA change in administration could also lead to an increase in the promotion of employment opportunities for US citizens versus visa holders or lawful permanent residents.\nNeed to Know More?\nThis blog outlines just some of the reasons why eligible applicants may want to consider applying for naturalization at this time. As always, consulting with an immigration attorney is crucial to understanding the nuances of naturalization and ensuring a successful application process.\nFor more information on pursuing naturalization, please contact Partner Isha Atassi at [email\u00a0protected] and Senior Associate Kimberly Tracey at [email\u00a0protected].\nThis blog was published on July 31, 2024, and due to the circumstances, there are frequent changes.

It is anticipated that for the first time, more than half of the global population will be eligible to vote.\nTo be eligible to vote in the US presidential election, you must be a US citizen. It is poised to be a critical election year in the US, with immigration remaining a hot campaign topic.\nThis blog discusses the process of becoming a US citizen (e.g., naturalization) and the benefits. Interested applicants are encouraged to proceed without delay. While the application process can be overwhelming, many resources can assist.\nNaturalization Overview\nNaturalization is the process of becoming an American citizen if you were born outside of the US. To be eligible for citizenship, you must meet the following criteria:\n\n\n\n\n\nBe at least 18 years of age;\nHave been a lawful permanent resident for at least five years and physically present in the United States for at least 30 months within the last five years;\n                                  \n\n\nIf married to a US citizen, have been a lawful permanent resident for at least three years and physically present in the US for 18 months out of the last three years.\n\n\n\n\nBe able to read, write and speak basic English;\nHave a basic understanding of US history and government;\nBe a person of good moral character, attached to the principles of the US Constitution, and well-disposed to the good order and happiness of the US.\n\n\n\n\n\nProcessing times for naturalization applications can vary depending on where you live. During an election year, we have observed the immigration service accelerate processing times resulting in quicker approvals, making it a good time to apply.\nBenefits of Applying for US Citizenship\nUS citizens enjoy many benefits that are not available to lawful permanent residents (e.g., green card holders). Some of those benefits include:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe right to vote in local, state and federal elections;\nProtection from deportation;\nEligibility to petition for family members;\nElimination of the requirement to renew your green card;\nRight to apply for federal benefits without restriction;\nAutomatic acquisition of citizenship for children under 18 in the custody of the naturalizing parent;\nTravel without restrictions \u2013 US passport holders can travel to many countries without a visa; and\nAbility to take lengthy absences from the US without the worry that you may have abandoned your residency.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, policies surrounding international travel can be heavily influenced by the presidential elections, which can lead to uncertainty and unpredictability for lawful permanent residents.\nFor example, in 2020, former President Trump issued several executive orders restricting travel for visa holders and permanent residents (even in some emergency circumstances). While some of those orders were implemented due to the global pandemic, the suddenness by which some of the orders were issued left many people anxious and stranded. US citizens were (and continue to be) protected from these types of travel restrictions.\nA change in administration could also lead to an increase in the promotion of employment opportunities for US citizens versus visa holders or lawful permanent residents.\nNeed to Know More?\nThis blog outlines just some of the reasons why eligible applicants may want to consider applying for naturalization at this time. As always, consulting with an immigration attorney is crucial to understanding the nuances of naturalization and ensuring a successful application process.\nFor more information on pursuing naturalization, please contact Partner Isha Atassi at [email\u00a0protected] and Senior Associate Kimberly Tracey at [email\u00a0protected].\nThis blog was published on July 31, 2024, and due to the circumstances, there are frequent changes.

It is anticipated that for the first time, more than half of the global population will be eligible to vote.\nTo be eligible to vote in the US presidential election, you must be a US citizen. It is poised to be a critical election year in the US, with immigration remaining a hot campaign topic.\nThis blog discusses the process of becoming a US citizen (e.g., naturalization) and the benefits. Interested applicants are encouraged to proceed without delay. While the application process can be overwhelming, many resources can assist.\nNaturalization Overview\nNaturalization is the process of becoming an American citizen if you were born outside of the US. To be eligible for citizenship, you must meet the following criteria:\n\n\n\n\n\nBe at least 18 years of age;\nHave been a lawful permanent resident for at least five years and physically present in the United States for at least 30 months within the last five years;\n                                  \n\n\nIf married to a US citizen, have been a lawful permanent resident for at least three years and physically present in the US for 18 months out of the last three years.\n\n\n\n\nBe able to read, write and speak basic English;\nHave a basic understanding of US history and government;\nBe a person of good moral character, attached to the principles of the US Constitution, and well-disposed to the good order and happiness of the US.\n\n\n\n\n\nProcessing times for naturalization applications can vary depending on where you live. During an election year, we have observed the immigration service accelerate processing times resulting in quicker approvals, making it a good time to apply.\nBenefits of Applying for US Citizenship\nUS citizens enjoy many benefits that are not available to lawful permanent residents (e.g., green card holders). Some of those benefits include:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe right to vote in local, state and federal elections;\nProtection from deportation;\nEligibility to petition for family members;\nElimination of the requirement to renew your green card;\nRight to apply for federal benefits without restriction;\nAutomatic acquisition of citizenship for children under 18 in the custody of the naturalizing parent;\nTravel without restrictions \u2013 US passport holders can travel to many countries without a visa; and\nAbility to take lengthy absences from the US without the worry that you may have abandoned your residency.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, policies surrounding international travel can be heavily influenced by the presidential elections, which can lead to uncertainty and unpredictability for lawful permanent residents.\nFor example, in 2020, former President Trump issued several executive orders restricting travel for visa holders and permanent residents (even in some emergency circumstances). While some of those orders were implemented due to the global pandemic, the suddenness by which some of the orders were issued left many people anxious and stranded. US citizens were (and continue to be) protected from these types of travel restrictions.\nA change in administration could also lead to an increase in the promotion of employment opportunities for US citizens versus visa holders or lawful permanent residents.\nNeed to Know More?\nThis blog outlines just some of the reasons why eligible applicants may want to consider applying for naturalization at this time. As always, consulting with an immigration attorney is crucial to understanding the nuances of naturalization and ensuring a successful application process.\nFor more information on pursuing naturalization, please contact Partner Isha Atassi at [email\u00a0protected] and Senior Associate Kimberly Tracey at [email\u00a0protected].\nThis blog was published on July 31, 2024, and due to the circumstances, there are frequent changes.

It is anticipated that for the first time, more than half of the global population will be eligible to vote.\nTo be eligible to vote in the US presidential election, you must be a US citizen. It is poised to be a critical election year in the US, with immigration remaining a hot campaign topic.\nThis blog discusses the process of becoming a US citizen (e.g., naturalization) and the benefits. Interested applicants are encouraged to proceed without delay. While the application process can be overwhelming, many resources can assist.\nNaturalization Overview\nNaturalization is the process of becoming an American citizen if you were born outside of the US. To be eligible for citizenship, you must meet the following criteria:\n\n\n\n\n\nBe at least 18 years of age;\nHave been a lawful permanent resident for at least five years and physically present in the United States for at least 30 months within the last five years;\n                                  \n\n\nIf married to a US citizen, have been a lawful permanent resident for at least three years and physically present in the US for 18 months out of the last three years.\n\n\n\n\nBe able to read, write and speak basic English;\nHave a basic understanding of US history and government;\nBe a person of good moral character, attached to the principles of the US Constitution, and well-disposed to the good order and happiness of the US.\n\n\n\n\n\nProcessing times for naturalization applications can vary depending on where you live. During an election year, we have observed the immigration service accelerate processing times resulting in quicker approvals, making it a good time to apply.\nBenefits of Applying for US Citizenship\nUS citizens enjoy many benefits that are not available to lawful permanent residents (e.g., green card holders). Some of those benefits include:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe right to vote in local, state and federal elections;\nProtection from deportation;\nEligibility to petition for family members;\nElimination of the requirement to renew your green card;\nRight to apply for federal benefits without restriction;\nAutomatic acquisition of citizenship for children under 18 in the custody of the naturalizing parent;\nTravel without restrictions \u2013 US passport holders can travel to many countries without a visa; and\nAbility to take lengthy absences from the US without the worry that you may have abandoned your residency.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, policies surrounding international travel can be heavily influenced by the presidential elections, which can lead to uncertainty and unpredictability for lawful permanent residents.\nFor example, in 2020, former President Trump issued several executive orders restricting travel for visa holders and permanent residents (even in some emergency circumstances). While some of those orders were implemented due to the global pandemic, the suddenness by which some of the orders were issued left many people anxious and stranded.

Isha Atassi, Kimberly Tracey\nAcross the world, 2024 has been dubbed the \u201cSuper Election\u201d year, as it is the biggest election year in history.\nThis year, more than 70 elections will take place around the world, and the US is no exception. It is anticipated that for the first time, more than half of the global population will be eligible to vote.\nTo be eligible to vote in the US presidential election, you must be a US citizen. It is poised to be a critical election year in the US, with immigration remaining a hot campaign topic.\nThis blog discusses the process of becoming a US citizen (e.g., naturalization) and the benefits. Interested applicants are encouraged to proceed without delay. While the application process can be overwhelming, many resources can assist.\nNaturalization Overview\nNaturalization is the process of becoming an American citizen if you were born outside of the US. To be eligible for citizenship, you must meet the following criteria:\n\n\n\n\n\nBe at least 18 years of age;\nHave been a lawful permanent resident for at least five years and physically present in the United States for at least 30 months within the last five years;\n                                  \n\n\nIf married to a US citizen, have been a lawful permanent resident for at least three years and physically present in the US for 18 months out of the last three years.\n\n\n\n\nBe able to read, write and speak basic English;\nHave a basic understanding of US history and government;\nBe a person of good moral character, attached to the principles of the US Constitution, and well-disposed to the good order and happiness of the US.\n\n\n\n\n\nProcessing times for naturalization applications can vary depending on where you live. During an election year, we have observed the immigration service accelerate processing times resulting in quicker approvals, making it a good time to apply.\nBenefits of Applying for US Citizenship\nUS citizens enjoy many benefits that are not available to lawful permanent residents (e.g., green card holders). Some of those benefits include:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe right to vote in local, state and federal elections;\nProtection from deportation;\nEligibility to petition for family members;\nElimination of the requirement to renew your green card;\nRight to apply for federal benefits without restriction;\nAutomatic acquisition of citizenship for children under 18 in the custody of the naturalizing parent;\nTravel without restrictions \u2013 US passport holders can travel to many countries without a visa; and\nAbility to take lengthy absences from the US without the worry that you may have abandoned your residency.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, policies surrounding international travel can be heavily influenced by the presidential elections, which can lead to uncertainty and unpredictability for lawful permanent residents.\nFor example, in 2020, former President Trump issued several executive orders restricting travel for visa holders and permanent residents (even in some emergency circumstances). While some of those orders were implemented due to the global pandemic, the suddenness by which some of the orders were issued left many people anxious and stranded. US citizens were (and continue to be) protected from these types of travel restrictions.\nA change in administration could also lead to an increase in the promotion of employment opportunities for US citizens versus visa holders or lawful permanent residents.\nNeed to Know More?\nThis blog outlines just some of the reasons why eligible applicants may want to consider applying for naturalization at this time.

While the application process can be overwhelming, many resources can assist.\nNaturalization Overview\nNaturalization is the process of becoming an American citizen if you were born outside of the US. To be eligible for citizenship, you must meet the following criteria:\n\n\n\n\n\nBe at least 18 years of age;\nHave been a lawful permanent resident for at least five years and physically present in the United States for at least 30 months within the last five years;\n                                  \n\n\nIf married to a US citizen, have been a lawful permanent resident for at least three years and physically present in the US for 18 months out of the last three years.\n\n\n\n\nBe able to read, write and speak basic English;\nHave a basic understanding of US history and government;\nBe a person of good moral character, attached to the principles of the US Constitution, and well-disposed to the good order and happiness of the US.\n\n\n\n\n\nProcessing times for naturalization applications can vary depending on where you live. During an election year, we have observed the immigration service accelerate processing times resulting in quicker approvals, making it a good time to apply.\nBenefits of Applying for US Citizenship\nUS citizens enjoy many benefits that are not available to lawful permanent residents (e.g., green card holders). Some of those benefits include:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe right to vote in local, state and federal elections;\nProtection from deportation;\nEligibility to petition for family members;\nElimination of the requirement to renew your green card;\nRight to apply for federal benefits without restriction;\nAutomatic acquisition of citizenship for children under 18 in the custody of the naturalizing parent;\nTravel without restrictions \u2013 US passport holders can travel to many countries without a visa; and\nAbility to take lengthy absences from the US without the worry that you may have abandoned your residency.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, policies surrounding international travel can be heavily influenced by the presidential elections, which can lead to uncertainty and unpredictability for lawful permanent residents.\nFor example, in 2020, former President Trump issued several executive orders restricting travel for visa holders and permanent residents (even in some emergency circumstances). While some of those orders were implemented due to the global pandemic, the suddenness by which some of the orders were issued left many people anxious and stranded. US citizens were (and continue to be) protected from these types of travel restrictions.\nA change in administration could also lead to an increase in the promotion of employment opportunities for US citizens versus visa holders or lawful permanent residents.\nNeed to Know More?\nThis blog outlines just some of the reasons why eligible applicants may want to consider applying for naturalization at this time. As always, consulting with an immigration attorney is crucial to understanding the nuances of naturalization and ensuring a successful application process.\nFor more information on pursuing naturalization, please contact Partner Isha Atassi at [email\u00a0protected] and Senior Associate Kimberly Tracey at [email\u00a0protected].\nThis blog was published on July 31, 2024, and due to the circumstances, there are frequent changes.

        "text": "Does Kim Jong Un Really \u2018Not Care\u2019 About the US Election?\nIn his speech accepting the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, former U.S. President Donald Trump flaunted his supposedly solid personal ties with Kim Jong Un and suggested the North Korean leader probably wanted him back in the White House, saying, \u201cI think he misses me.\u201d A few days later, however, the state-run Korean Central News Agency of North Korea delivered a stinging rebuke to Trump, saying, \u201cNo matter what administration takes office in the U.S., the political climate, which is confused by the infighting of the two parties, does not change and, accordingly, we do not care about this.\u201d\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth considering if Kim honestly \u201cdoes not care\u201d about the upcoming U.S. presidential election. I would argue that he does, and quite significantly, depending on who takes the helm in the White House. For Kim Jong Un, the next five years could be a period of profound uncertainty, with potential outcomes ranging from the worst-case scenario to a situation ripe for negotiations.\n\nThe worst-case scenario for Kim would be a victory by Vice President Kamala Harris, who has been endorsed by incumbent President Joe Biden as his successor as the Democratic presidential candidate. Harris\u2019 approach to North Korea is anticipated to continue to mirror Biden\u2019s. The Biden administration has primarily focused on pressuring the international community to enforce sanctions against North Korea, blocking illicit funds that Pyongyang could use for weapons of mass destruction, and highlighting human rights abuses under Kim\u2019s rule. With close bilateral and trilateral cooperation with allies South Korea and Japan, strengthening deterrence against North Korea has been a critical focus of Biden\u2019s North Korea policy. Harris\u2019 past comments on North Korea also suggest that she would continue this policy, which would significantly impact Kim\u2019s regime.\n\nFor Kim, a Harris administration would raise various concerns inside and outside North Korea. First, the constant updates to sanctions on North Korea, which the Biden administration has been eagerly leading, are one of the central obstacles to economic development. While the Bank of Korea recently reported that North Korea\u2019s GDP rose 3.1 percent in 2023 due to eased COVID-19 restrictions and favorable weather conditions, assessments still suggest that this economic rebound would likely be temporary.\n\nIf Harris becomes president, the trend of ever-tighter economic sanctions imposed by the U.S. against North Korea will be firmly maintained, thereby reducing the number of options available to Kim Jong Un by further restricting trade, limiting foreign exchange earnings, and isolating financial institutions. In a worst-case scenario, economic suffering could make it difficult for Kim to maintain his regime.\n\nThe weakening royal status of North Korea\u2019s ruling family, especially among young, tech-savvy North Koreans, is also one of the significant political challenges faced by Kim Jong Un. Many North Korean defectors report growing negative evaluations of Kim, increased dissatisfaction with Kim\u2019s hereditary succession, and rising antipathy toward the \u201cBaekdu bloodline\u201d on which the legitimacy of the Kim dynasty is based. The Kim family\u2019s divine presence has diminished significantly since Kim Jong Un came to power.\n\nThe influx of information into North Korea, such as South Korean drama and K-pop, has exposed North Koreans, especially young people, to alternative perspectives, economic disparities, and global culture \u2013 despite the Kim regime criminalizing such exchanges. The Biden administration\u2019s effort to increase access of North Koreans to outside information, which Harris would continue, would keep threatening the state propaganda by broadening awareness of North Koreans and opening minds to reality \u2013 including the reality of human rights violations in North Korea, which is aiming to maintain the power of the royal family, not aiming for the prosperity of North Korean citizens.\n\nDiplomatically, strengthening the trilateral security cooperation of the U.S., South Korea, and Japan, an effort that will be maintained if Harris becomes president, is not good news for Kim, either. North Korea recently achieved a diplomatic accomplishment through the Russia-North Korea pact thanks to the intensified \u201cnew cold war\u201d tensions. Some see this as evidence that the increasing trilateral partnership between the U.S., South Korea, and Japan has backfired. However, Kim knows the Russia-North Korea alliance is not as strong as the bilateral alliance between South Korea and the United States. Kim also recognizes that North Korea\u2019s partnership with China, which considers Pyongyang an oddity, if not an outright burden, is not much different from Russia\u2019s.\n\nThe South Korea-Japan-U.S. trilateral, which Harris will maintain or strengthen if she is elected this November, will keep strengthening deterrence against North Korean aggression, increasing regional security cooperation, and presenting a unified front in negotiations. This will limit Kim\u2019s international influence and legitimacy, constraining North Korea\u2019s diplomatic maneuverability.\n\nCompared to Harris, Trump would be the lesser of two evils for Kim Jong Un. Trump may try to reduce the number of U.S. troops stationed in South Korea, thinking that the U.S. troops are not needed on the peninsula. That is what Kim also wants. Additionally, Trump\u2019s volatility could cause a rift in the South Korea-U.S. alliance, which could be disconcerting for the Yoon Suk-yeol administration, which has consistently pursued a North Korean policy based on pressure. Beyond that, a second Trump administration might damage the broad framework of cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region, including the South Korea-Japan-U.S. trilateral, established by the Biden administration, which would be to Kim\u2019s advantage.\n\nThe previous Trump administration\u2019s policy toward North Korea was \u201cfinal, fully verified denuclearization (FFVD),\u201d the same policy other U.S. leaders have maintained, albeit with different terminology. However, Trump\u2019s caprice suggests this is not set in stone, as he showed during his recent acceptance speech. His comment, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to get along with somebody that has a lot of nuclear weapons or otherwise,\u201d suggests that Trump might treat Kim as the leader of a nuclear state.\n\nIn addition, Trump previously proved willing to neglect North Korean human rights issues \u2013 which Pyongyang doesn\u2019t want the international community to stir up \u2013 during his nuclear negotiations with Kim. Overall, if Trump is elected, this would buy time for Kim to deal with the economic, political, and diplomatic issues faced by North Korea.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that Kim Jong Un experienced the breakdown of the Hanoi summit as a humiliating diplomatic failure. A Trump victory, and the possibility of a repeat summit, is unlikely to be an enjoyable alternative for Kim.\n\nAlthough Kim Jong Un said he \u201cdoesn\u2019t care\u201d about the upcoming U.S. presidential election, he might secretly be hoping for Trump to win. Kim must have many worries as he watches the U.S. presidential election turnaround with Harris taking the Democratic candidacy. However, we can expect Kim to ultimately reaffirm his commitment to nurturing a \u201cself-reliant\u201d North Korea that no longer must suffer being dragged around by the great powers. There is no doubt that this commitment will result in Kim\u2019s actions to accelerate the advancement of nuclear weapons.",

        "text": "2024 Iranian presidential election\nEarly presidential elections in Iran were held on 28 June and 5 July 2024[1] following the death of incumbent president Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash on 19 May.[2]\n\nFour candidates contested the first round of the election, in which Masoud Pezeshkian won 44%, Saeed Jalili won 40%, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf won 14% and Mostafa Pourmohammadi won less than 1% of the vote. Pezeshkian was the only reformist candidate on the ballot.[3] As no candidate won a majority in the first round, a run off vote was held on 5 July between Jalili and Pezeshkian,[4] which the latter won with 53.7% of the vote. On 6 July 2024, the Ministry of Interior declared Pezeshkian the winner of the election,[5] with Jalili conceding defeat shortly thereafter.[6]\n\nWith a 39.93% turnout, the first round of the election saw the lowest participation for a presidential election in the Islamic Republic's history.[7] The turnout improved in the second round to 49.68%. Pezeshkian was seated as president after the ballot certification process was completed. His inauguration was held on 28 July.\n\nBackground [ edit ]\n\nOn 19 May 2024, after Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi inaugurated a hydroelectric complex at the Giz Galasi Reservoir near the Iran-Azerbaijan border, together with the President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev, Raisi departed from the site in a helicopter.[8] The helicopter carrying Raisi and seven other passengers and crew[9] crashed at approximately 13:30 IRST (UTC+03:30) near the village of Uzi in Varzaqan County in East Azerbaijan province.[10][11] Later that day, the wreckage of the helicopter was located,[12] with everyone on board found dead. This led to First Vice President Mohammad Mokhber becoming the acting president according to Article 131 of the Constitution.[13]\n\nElectoral system [ edit ]\n\nThe president of Iran is usually elected every four years by a \"direct vote of the people\", as set out by Article 114 of the Iranian Constitution.[13] The upcoming presidential election was scheduled to take place on or before 18 June 2025, but was held earlier due to the death of the president. Under Iran's political system, the President is the country's highest directly elected official, the chief of the executive branch, and the second most important position after that of the Supreme Leader.[14] The minimum voting age is 18.\n\nAccording to the Islamic Republic of Iran's constitution, any Iranian citizen who believes in Shia Islam, is loyal to the Constitution, the ideology of Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist and the Islamic Republic can participate in the election as a presidential candidate. The Election Monitoring Agency (EMA), managed by the Guardian Council, vets registered candidates and selects a handful to run in the election.[15]\n\nThe Guardian Council does not publicly announce the reason for rejections of particular candidates, although those reasons are privately explained to each candidate. Women are not constitutionally restricted from running, but all who have registered as candidates have been disqualified by the Guardian Council.[16][17] The council has officially denied rejecting a woman's candidacy because of her gender.[18]\n\nCandidates approved by the Guardian Council are put to a public vote. The winner is the candidate who receives a majority (50% plus one) of votes. If no candidate receives enough votes, a run-off election is held between the two candidates with the most votes the following Friday.[19] Iranians who vote during the election receive a stamp that indicates so on their birth certificates.[20]\n\nAccording to the constitution, once the result is known, the Supreme Leader must sign the decree of the elected president, and if he refuses to sign, the elected president will not assume the presidency. As of 2024, Supreme Leaders have always signed the decree of the elected president.[21][22] After that, the elected president must recite and sign an oath in a session of the Islamic Consultative Assembly, in the presence of the members of the Guardian Council and the head of the Supreme Court.[19]\n\nFor this election, more than 61 million citizens were eligible to vote, with about 18 million of them between 18 and 30 years old.[23] Voters were required to present identity booklets, passports or smart Iranian identity cards [24] The Ministry of Intelligence warned that presidential nominees were under constant monitoring.[25]\n\nOverseas voting [ edit ]\n\nVoting for overseas Iranians was held in 344 locations worldwide.[26][27] In Australia, polling was canceled in Brisbane and Sydney due to protests by the Iranian diaspora.[28] Opponents of the Iranian government, who wanted a boycott of the election, criticized the Biden administration for allowing the installation of voting stations in the United States.[29] Saudi Arabia[30] and Canada refused to grant Iran permission to install overseas ballot boxes,[31] though the decision was later reversed in Saudi Arabia.[32] Voting stations for Canadian voters were instead placed on the US-Canada border.[33]\n\nFollowing the announcement of Raisi's death on 20 May, authorities announced that voting would be held on 28 June.[1] Registration of candidates began on 30 May and ran until 3 June,[34] while campaigning lasted from 12 June until 27 June.[1]\n\nThe registration to run for the presidency started on 30 May and ended on 3 June. A total of 80 people, including four women, filed their candidacies for president.[35] Most candidates were considered as conservatives or ultra conservatives.[36] The final list of candidates was released by the Guardian Council on 9 June.[37] Per Article 99 of the Constitution, those rejected by the council are not allowed to protest the rejection.[13][38]\n\nApplied [ edit ]\n\nRejected [ edit ]\n\nA total of 74 aspirants had their candidacies rejected by the Guardian Council.[37] These included all four women who applied to run in the election.[56] The applications of least 30 candidacies were rejected on 30 May for failure to meet the \"basic conditions for qualification\".[57] Former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was the most notable to be disqualified by the Guardian Council, having been disqualified previously in 2021.[58]\n\nApproved [ edit ]\n\nSix candidates were allowed by the Guardian Council to run for president, namely Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, Saeed Jalili, Masoud Pezeshkian, Mostafa Pourmohammadi, Amirhossein Ghazizadeh Hashemi and Alireza Zakani.[37] On 26 June, Hashemi withdrew his candidacy and called on other candidates to follow \"so that the front of the revolution will be strengthened\". He was followed on 27 June by Zakani, who did so citing the need to \"block the formation of a third administration\" of former President Hassan Rouhani.[59] Both candidates, as well as Ghalibaf, subsequently endorsed Jalili in the second round.[60]\n\nCampaign platforms [ edit ]\n\nIn a speech on 3 June, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei told candidates not to attack each other and expressed his preference for a \"revolutionary president\".[64]\n\nThe authorities gave 20GB of free internet data for use on domestic messengers and Telewebion for 30 days to mobile phones to promote information regarding the election.[65] US-funded Radio Farda anticipated the total cost of the election to be more than US$357 million.[66]\n\nSaeed Jalili [ edit ]\n\nSaeed Jalili of the Front of Islamic Revolution Stability ran for president for the fourth time. He is the Supreme Leader's personal representative to the Supreme National Security Council and was formerly its Secretary, during which he was involved in the Iran nuclear negotiations.[67] Jalili was involved in governmental activities for the decade leading into the election.[68] He is backed by the Islamic Society of Students.[69] Jalili opposed negotiations with the West and the ratification of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).[70] In addition, Jalili supported the completion of an additional one million housing units.[71] Jalili opposed importing cars from overseas while Ghalibaf supported the import of cars.[72] Jalili promised three days of free vacation to government tourist residences for every citizen per year.[73]\n\nMasoud Pezeshkian [ edit ]\n\nOf the six candidates confirmed by the Guardian Council, Masoud Pezeshkian was regarded to be the only one representing moderates and reformists.[37] He was backed by Nedaye Iranian, the National Trust Party, Moderation and Development Party, Coalition of Reformist Women's Parties,[74][75][76] as well as former President Mohammad Khatami, former foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif[77] and the Assembly of the Forces of Imam's Line.[78] Pezeshkian's campaign slogan is \"Living without Shamefulness\".[79][80] He campaigned against the Guidance patrol's 2024 Nour program[81] and criticized Iranian laws on the wearing of the hijab.[82]\n\nIn his campaign speech, Pezeshkian said that he could not do anything for political prisoners as the power to release them does not belong to the president.[83] He told students not to insult Khamenei and that he had \"assimilated into the Supreme leader\".[84][85] His campaign staff used the song Baraye written by imprisoned singer Shervin Hajipour.[86] Pezeshkian also supported the banning of Afghan immigrants.[87]\n\nMohammad Bagher Ghalibaf [ edit ]\n\nGhalibaf promised to reduce the number of Afghan immigrants[88] and build a wall along Iran's borders with Afghanistan and Pakistan.[89] He expressed his support for strengthening the Axis of Resistance.[90] Ghalibaf promised better pay to health workers in order to stop emigration.[91] He said that he is open to closer relations with the United States and negotiating a new nuclear deal to alleviate Iran of its economic woes.[92]\n\nMostafa Pourmohammadi [ edit ]\n\nMostafa Pourmohammadi pledged an end to internet censorship[93] and supports nuclear negotiations but from a position of power.[94] He criticized Iranian military support for the Russian invasion of Ukraine due to what he called a lack of reciprocal benefits from Russia.[96]\n\nAlireza Zakani [ edit ]\n\nAlireza Zakani pledged to give away 120 tons of free meat every day.[97] He promised free health care for women and seniors and cash payments to the poor.\n\nDebates [ edit ]\n\nFirst round [ edit ]\n\nIRIB exclusively held and broadcast the presidential debates.[98][99] The questions to be asked in the debates were shared with all candidates beforehand.[100] The IRIB and the Election Office warned candidates against ruining the country's public image.[101][102] Documentaries will be also produced by IRIB for nominees.[103] The government also banned displaying images of candidates with Ali Khamenei and his predecessor as Supreme Leader, Ruhollah Khomeini.[104]\n\nThe candidates were asked during the first debate on issues such as inflation, the government's budget deficit, housing and corruption. All candidates pledged to have sanctions against Iran lifted, strengthen the rial and introduce reforms.[77] In the debate, Ghalibaf made several false claims on the economy, regarding energy waste in the country, national GDP and productivity rate.[105] Journalist Vahid Ashtari alleged that Ghalibaf falsely claimed about never having sued any journalist.[106] Ashtari was arrested on 20 June after posting luggage records of Ghalibaf's daughter, who travelled to Turkey.[107] Zakani falsely said that there were no hijab police deployed in the Tehran Metro and that he had not opposed imported COVID-19 vaccines.[108][109] Pourmohammedi claimed that IRIB TV2's news program 20:30 censored and manipulated a video he sent them.[110]\n\nDuring the 20 June debates, while discussing culture Pezeshkian's advisor Mohammed Fazeli threw his microphone and left the debate after getting into an argument with one of the hosts.[111] Economic issues were again discussed during the debate, as well as fuel subsidies and education.[112] In the third debate Hashemi promised to make an area in beaches for women to ride jet skis and do water sports,[113] while Pourmohammedi promised to decriminalize not wearing a hijab and stop violent responses by police and Basij.[114] Jalili criticized media attention to Mahsa Amini's death rather than the deaths of thousands of women in Gaza.[115] Ghalibaf claimed Iran's National Information Network has progressed 75%, which Factnameh [fa] said was \"unverifiable\".[116]\n\nIn the fourth debate Pourmohammadi called Jalili a traitor for sabotaging the FATF ratification and Ahmadinejad's Crescent petroleum deal,[117] which Jalili denied and said the Crescent agreement was flawed.[118] Hashemi criticized Hassan Rouhani and the reformists for warmongering in Afghanistan and praised Ebrahim Raisi for making peace and not letting Israel advance.[119] Pourmohammadi called the 1988 executions of Iranian political prisoners a \"project of difficult times of the government\" and that \"only People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran members who were fighting against the people were executed.\"[120]\n\nIn the fifth debate Hashemi promised to eliminate twelve months conscription for males.[121] Hashemi denied that Internet censorship in Iran exists, while Pezeshkian defended the 2019 Internet blackout in Iran.[122] Pourmohammadi pledged to bring transparency to the Tehran Stock Exchange.[123] Ghalibaf blamed Debsh government corruption on inequity.[124] During a debate on women, a representative of Jalili blamed women for being assaulted for not wearing a hijab.[125] Jalili himself told an interviewer that they did not understand the \"strategic depth\" of the hijab laws.[89] IRIB censored Pezeshkian's talk where he supported Mahsa Amini.[126]\n\nDebate list No Date and time Viewership 1 17 June [ 127 ] 26\u201327% [ 128 ] 2 20 June 3 21 June 4 24 June 5 25 June\n\nSecond round [ edit ]\n\nDuring a two-hour televised debate on IRIB on 1 July, Pezeshkian criticized Jalili over his lack of managerial experience, his stance on nuclear negotiations and his pledge to achieve an economic growth rate of 8% while in office, adding that authorities should be allowed to \"execute\" Jalili if his target was not met. Jalili accused Pezeshkian of having no plans to manage the country and instead lead it to a \"backward position\". Both candidates pledged to address issues involving the poor, workers, women, ethnic groups and religious minorities, as well as improve internet services. They also called for an investigation into the low turnout in the first round.[129] Pezeshkian called a situation in Iran a deadlock and said that no government will grow in a cage. He again criticized Jalili for his shadow state.[130]\n\nDuring the final debate on 2 July, Pezeshkian pledged to revive a nuclear agreement with foreign powers, while Jalili called on the US to honor its commitments on par \"with the commitments we fulfilled.\" Both candidates pledged to improve the economy, provide energy subsidies to the poor and facilitate the importation of cars while supporting domestic automobile makers.[131] Jalili made several misleading claims over the economy that sought to criticize the Rouhani administration and praise that of Raisi's.[132]\n\nCriticism [ edit ]\n\nThe Guardian Council denied allegations that they had rigged the election.[133] Abdolhamid Ismaeelzahi, the Sunni Friday Imam of Sistan and Baluchistan, criticized the system for not allowing women and religious minority candidates and closing down Sunni mosques and questioned the presidency's powers.[134][135][136] Four Sunni clerics were arrested in Urmia for criticizing the election.[137] Overseas monarchist opposition figures and groups such as Reza Pahlavi, the former crown prince of Iran, and the re-formed Iran-Novin Party called the election a circus.[138][139] United Against Nuclear Iran, an anti-Iran lobby group in the US, claimed that IRGC Baqiatallah HQ was engineering the election.[140] The National Front boycotted the election.[141]\n\nAlthough doing so is criminalized,[142] the Iranian Complainant Mothers,[143] Faezeh Hashemi Rafsanjani (the daughter of former president Akbar Rafsanjani),[144] Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi,[145] imprisoned activist Abolfazl Ghadyani,[146] house-arrested former prime minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi and his wife Zahra Rahnavard[147] and the Coalition for a Secular Democratic Republic in Iran [fa][148] have called for the boycotting of the election. Various reformist political prisoners like Mostafa Tajzadeh refused to support participating. The hashtag #ElectionCircus became prominent topics among Iranians on social media,[149] as well as the hashtag \"traitorous minority\", referring to calls against voting for either Pezeshkian or Jalili in the second round and calling anyone who does so a \"traitor\".[150]\n\nIn the first round, a majority of voters abstained from voting, resulting in a turnout of 39.93%, the lowest in the history of the Islamic Republic.[7] Turnout increased to 49.68% of votes in the runoff, possibly to prevent the election of Jalili.[151]\n\nMasoud Pezeshkian's victory sparked controversy over Saeed Jalili's self-styled shadow government. Critics challenged its legitimacy, funding, and transparency, arguing it disrupts governance and lacks a clear legal basis in Iran.[152]\n\nOpinion polling and forecasts [ edit ]\n\nThe Iranian Students Polling Agency predicted a turnout of 44.4%.[165][166] According to a poll conducted between 26 and 29 May 2024 by the Majlis Research Center, the voter turnout is predicted to be over 53%.[167] At the other end of the spectrum, polling conducted by the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance predicted just 30% participation in Tehran.[168] The Law Enforcement Command of the Islamic Republic of Iran warned people against sharing posts with fake polls, declaring it a crime.[169]\n\nOn 25 June, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called for \"high participation\" in the election, calling it \"the pride of the Islamic republic\".[170] He also warned against supporting candidates who believe that \"all ways to progress\" come from the United States.[171] Abbas Abdi, one of Iran's most influential reformist figures, predicted a maximum turnout of 60%, and a minimum of 55%.[172][173] The IRGC's Telegram channel conducted a poll in which Pezeshkian won 60% of the votes.[174]\n\nConduct [ edit ]\n\nPezeshkian voting in election\n\nVoting was held in nearly 60,000 voting stations and 90,000 \"voting points\" nationwide, while more than 300 voting stations were set up overseas. Polling in the first round was initially expected to run from 08:00 to 18:00,[175] but was extended at the last minute by the Interior Ministry to 20:00.[176] Polling was also extended until midnight on the second round of voting.[177]\n\nIncidents [ edit ]\n\nA video was posted during the campaign of a pro-Pezeshkian lawyer in Tabriz being beaten up in a desert by security forces. The Ministry of Justice opened an investigation.[178] Two members of the security forces were killed in a gun attack on a vehicle carrying election boxes in Sistan and Baluchistan.[179]\n\nIran's Internet Minister claimed that the country's fiber optic network was sabotaged on 28 June.[180] The interior ministry said it had arrested members of \"Project 1000 Squares\" which had planned to celebrate the election win of an undisclosed candidate.[181]\n\nOn 19 July, the governor[b] of Basht was arrested on charges of electoral misconduct.[182]\n\nResults [ edit ]\n\nOfficial results showed Pezeshkian and Jalili heading into a run-off scheduled on 5 July. Turnout in the first round was at 40 percent, the lowest for a presidential election in Iran since 1979,[183] while a total of 1,056,159 ballots were deemed as spoiled. The election also saw the first presidential run-off vote in Iran since 2005.[184]\n\nProvincial data (first round) [ edit ]\n\nVote composition of Iranian provinces along with participation rates [ 185 ] Province Masoud Pezeshkian (Votes) Saeed Jalili (Votes) Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf (Votes) Mostafa Pourmohammadi (Votes) Total Votes Participation Rate (%) Azarbaijan, East 1,067,088 244,076 57,432 7,276 1,402,108 44.11 Azarbaijan, West 806,620 145,619 58,011 4,960 1,010,210 40 Ardabil 382,647 72,878 36,377 2,676 504,602 48.5 Isfahan 428,098 868,431 139,979 16,524 1,454,032 41 Alborz 298,664 271,695 97,182 741 674,148 40.13 Ilam 119,843 44,706 30,852 1,704 208,187 47 Bushehr 144,138 167,217 40,850 2,618 374,345 46.5 Tehran 1,492,164 1,165,518 673,000 35,582 3,366,264 33 Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari 123,046 118,523 28,231 2,464 282,264 40 Khorasan, South 102,354 225,825 48,776 2,319 391,329 64 Khorasan, Razavi 661,493 1,212,033 429,458 19,330 2,415,696 49.39 Khorasan, North 115,697 115,672 57,638 1,026 320,407 45 Khuzestan 433,699 524,084 175,732 12,529 1,146,044 29.6 Zanjan 195,165 132,409 48,479 1,026 392,000 46.2 Semnan 73,287 137,081 34,759 2,302 262,284 49.2 Sistan and Baluchestan 443,226 199,976 87,788 4,368 735,358 40 Fars 532,947 634,294 132,848 10,292 1,310,381 36 Qazvin 156,853 166,852 51,811 3,358 395,753 42.8 Qom TBD TBD TBD TBD TBD 57 Kordestan TBD TBD TBD TBD TBD TBD Kerman 329,470 477,589 215,892 8,513 1,070,286 46 Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad 123,240 102,112 55,348 1,518 288,937 49.3 Golestan 275,366 205,974 81,095 5,023 591,201 41.16 Gilan 317,248 216,339 90,019 6,759 656,936 32.6 Lorestan 234,721 191,510 100,967 4,395 540,000 36 Mazandaran 406,485 448,308 132,151 9,629 1,043,570 42.3 Markazi 136,282 233,645 61,359 4,355 457,074 39.9 Hormozgan TBD TBD TBD TBD TBD TBD Hamedan 199,466 266,875 76,583 5,283 572,842 39 Yazd 165,696 213513 35,680 3,829 436,722 58.18\n\nMaps and graphs [ edit ]\n\nFirst Round [ edit ]\n\nWinner by province\n\nResult of the Iranian presidential election by province (in percentage)\n\nFirst round results by province.

In his concession statement, Jalili called for Pezeshkian to be respected. Pezeshkian is expected to assume the presidency within 30 days of the election, after he resigns from his seat in the Islamic Consultative Assembly and gains the formal approval of Khamenei.[186] In his speech in the Mausoleum of Ruhollah Khomeini, Pezeshkian thanked Khamenei for his support.[187] Khamenei praised the turnout despite what he called a campaign \"by the enemies of the Iranian nation to induce despair and a feeling of hopelessness\" and called on Pezeshkian to \"set his vision on high, bright horizons.\"[188]\n\nSenior Khamenei advisor Kamal Kharazi stated that the election would not affect Iranian foreign policy as it is controlled by the Strategic Council for Foreign Relations [fa].[189]\n\nIn his first post victory op-ed Pezeshkian called the 25 year cooperation between China and Iran a milestone and commended Iran-Russia detente.[190]\n\nOn 28 July, Pezeshkian received Khamenei's official endorsement to hold office as president. Pezeshkian also appointed as his first vice president Mohammad Reza Aref, a reformist politician who had previously served in the same position under Mohammad Khatami.[191]\n\nReactions [ edit ]\n\nDomestic [ edit ]\n\nKhamenei downplayed the low turnout in the first round, saying that it did not indicate opposition to the political system,[192] but ordered an investigation into its causes.[193] Former minister Ata'ollah Mohajerani criticized the administration of President Mokhber for failing to fulfill its mandate and campaigning instead for Jalili.[194] Mokhber has denied this.[195] The newspaper Kayhan published an editorial saying that the government will not give in to blackmail by election boycotters.[196] The reformist newspapers Sazandegi and Hammihan urged voters to participate in the election through their editorials.[197]\n\nFormer MP Mahmoud Sadeghi said that the Islamic Development Organization paid clerics to campaign for Jalili.[198] Commanding general of the IRGC, Hossein Salami called the election \"today's jihad\".[199][200] The Alliance for Democracy and Freedom in Iran's Hamed Esmaeilion, Reza Pahlavi and Masih Alinejad hailed the historically low turnout as a victory against the regime.[201]\n\nInternational [ edit ]\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nNotes [ edit ]\n\n^ This poll took the percentages of the candidates among those who already had a preference.

        "text": "Q&A: Professor William Howell Discusses What's at Stake in the 2024 Presidential Election\nProfessor William Howell\n\nThe United States presidential election of 2024 is in full swing, with former President Donald Trump and Senator J. D. Vance of Ohio accepting the Republican nomination and incumbent President Joe Biden declining the Democratic nomination in favor of his Vice President, Kamala Harris.\n\nIn a campaign with this many twists and turns, with inflation, immigration, and the future of democracy as topics on the campaign trail, we sat down with William Howell, the Sydney Stein Professor in American Politics and the director of the Center for Effective Government at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy, to gain some insight.\n\nHow would you characterize what's at stake for the country? Is it really the most important election of our lifetime, as people on both sides seem to feel?\n\nThe stakes, of course, are enormous. A great deal hangs in the balance in this election: the health and wellbeing of our democracy, all manner of policy issues, and, not least, the future of the Democratic and Republican parties.\n\nThat said, I\u2019m reticent to talk about any single election being \u201cthe most important\u201d in our history or lifetimes. Looking back, we are plainly living in a politics defined by the beginning of the Iraq War, something that would have been inconceivable had Al Gore prevailed in the 2000 election. It also hard to imagine a Trump presidency without Obama\u2019s election in 2008 and reelection in 2012. Every one of these elections mattered a great deal, both for what they immediately ushered in, and for what they meant for future elections.\n\nIs 2024 the most important election of our lifetime? Sure\u2013as was the last one, and the one before that.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the withdrawal of incumbent President Joe Biden from the race before the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Were Democrats\u2019 concerns about Biden\u2019s ability to win overblown?\n\nNo. It wasn't some spasm of misguided anxiety that led the Democratic Party to impulsively boot their front-runner from the race; it was done with real cause. President Biden\u2019s debate performance in June spoke to lingering, deep, and abiding concerns about his age and his ability to perform the duties of office.\n\nPresident Biden\u2019s debate performance tapped into concerns that were both widely felt and very real. Much of the presidency is about communication and performing in public. During his term in office, Biden was shielded from much public exposure. When he did speak without the safety of a teleprompter, many of his supporters grimaced along. And this is what happened in the last four years. Never mind what's going to happen for the next.\n\nBiden clearly wanted to see this campaign through to the end, but he had no choice but to stand down. What we\u2019ve just witnessed has been a party coming to terms with a very real problem and doing something in the final hour to rectify it. All kinds of pressure were applied so that, in the end, Biden's hand was forced.\n\nWould Biden have ended up winning in November? Probably not, but we don't really know. Will Kamala Harris necessarily win by virtue of this shift? We\u2019ll have to wait and see. What we can say with certainty now is that the Democratic Party undertook this change with real cause.\n\nShould President Biden have any hope at meaningful legislation or reform in the remaining time he has in office?\n\nGiven the partisan composition of Congress and Biden\u2019s waning influence, it\u2019s hard to imagine that he'll be able to accomplish any great feats legislatively. But on three fronts, we may see continued evidence of this sitting president\u2019s influence.\n\nOne is an acceleration of regulatory activity that's handled through the administrative state. There is regularly a burst of unilateral activity in the final months of presidents when they're in office, and I think we can expect to see that now.\n\nWe can also expect to see Biden working behind the scenes trying to shore up the international coalition in support of the war in Ukraine, and to shape foreign policy as it relates to Israel. Those are two hotspots around the globe that the United States has been heavily involved in, and where Biden doesn't need, at least for the next six months, lots of congressional support in order to influence ground-level operations.\n\nThe third area is one where, admittedly, I\u2019d like to see change. A lament I have about the Biden presidency is, frankly, the inattention paid to institutional reforms in service of a stronger democracy. There was a brief moment early in his term where Biden thought about filibuster reform and another brief moment when he assembled a group of lawyers to think about judicial reform. Since then, very little has happened. But that may be changing. Biden recently announced a set of proposed reforms to the judicial branch, including 18-year term limits for Supreme Court justices. I\u2019d like to see him to turn to those themes more, if only to set a democracy reform agenda for the intermediate future.\n\nAs it pertains to shoring up our democratic systems, Democrats have consistently called former President Trump a threat to democracy. Are those claims legitimate?\n\nYes, they are legitimate.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: Democrats are certainly trying to push this narrative so that they can win in November. They aren't neutral arbiters in a serious-minded evaluation of the stakes of the upcoming election. They are looking for advantages in order to win it.\n\nThat being said, the future of democracy in important respects does hang in the balance, particularly when you think about the Trump administration's plans to retrench the administrative state. Project 2025 is an extraordinary, coordinated effort on the part of conservatives to finally lay waste to the administrative state, which they see as an abomination in the constitutional order. And they plan to do so by massively, massively increasing the number of political appointees to the federal bureaucracy. It's the administrative state that interprets and implements statutes, that sets the government in motion. So when Trump promises to drain the swamp, and when members of his party call for the wholesale and indiscriminate firing of civil servants, these aren't idle threats: They come from a long history of conservative skepticism and opposition to the administrative state. They see this as their moment to finally kneecap the federal bureaucracy.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all: When you see the damage Trump has done to democratic norms and practices, and his taste for autocratic power, the stakes of the upcoming election appear in stark relief. When you just listen to Trump, take him at his word, it\u2019s plainly apparent that we have real reasons to be concerned about the health and wellbeing of our democracy.\n\nWill Democrats save our democracy, once and for all? No. Will Harris shore up our institutions, should she be elected? Probably not. But the threat from former President Trump is real. We should take it very seriously.\n\nWhat about Trump\u2019s legal travails? What do you make of the judicial system\u2019s ability to handle the cases against him?\n\nSay what you will about the general importance of the federal judiciary. The idea that the third branch of government is going to serve as a robust guard against demagoguery and the entreaties of a strongman president is just foolhardy.\n\nOn legal grounds, many saw the classified documents case as being the strongest among the bunch brought against Trump. It\u2019s astonishing that a district-level Trump appointee with an extreme interpretation of the structure of government saw fit to just dismiss it. It's outrageous, and it comes on the heel of all kinds of delays. Meanwhile, the Georgia election interference case founders, and the January 6 case brought by the Justice Department is wrapped up in the Supreme Court\u2019s newfound discovery of presidential immunity. In the slow pace of its deliberations and the contents of its rulings, the federal judiciary is all but insisting that it won\u2019t check the unilateral actions of a strongman president\u2014not reliably, not consistently, not urgently.\n\nFormer President Trump has chosen United States Senator J. D. Vance of Ohio as his running mate, and Vice President Harris is currently considering her options. How much does a vice presidential selection matter, and what should Harris consider as she\u2019s picking her VP?\n\nWith respect to electoral returns, vice presidential selections don\u2019t matter an awful lot. There\u2019s some evidence, though certainly not overwhelming, that vice presidents may be able to deliver their home state. But in this era of acute partisan polarization, the effect is likely to be even smaller than what the historical record might suggest.\n\nWhat matters is twofold: (1) the selection of a vice president provides insight into the trajectory of a party and the kind of administration the president intends to hold; and (2) the selected individual may him or herself become president, either as a result of a vacancy in office or because they\u2019re the chosen standard-bearer in the aftermath of a presidential term of office. More than anything Kamala Harris recently accomplished, it was her position as Vice President that did the most to deliver her the Democratic Party\u2019s nomination for president this year.\n\nOr let\u2019s take J. D. Vance. His selection speaks to Trump's total unwillingness to countenance any disagreement within his ranks, just as it speaks to his ambition that the populist wing of the Republican Party carry forward in the years ahead. There's real meaning in that selection. Trump is not a young man; he\u2019ll be 82 at the end of his term if he is elected again\u2013just as old as Biden is now. If something were to happen to him\u2013and I certainly hope that it does not\u2013then we\u2019d promptly have as president someone whose entire experience in elected office amounted to two years spent in the Senate.\n\nMeanwhile, Harris is trying to select her own VP. It's not an accident that she's looking at a bunch of governors, many of whom are political moderates who will appeal to independents and that sliver of the electorate that hasn't made up its mind between voting D or voting R. But when making her pick, she surely is paying to issues that go beyond electoral considerations. Presidents regularly select governing partners who can fill out their own experience. Many people thought that President Barack Obama's selection of Biden in 2008 was informed in no small part by Biden's foreign policy experience. Harris may do the same.\n\nAnd lastly, I expect that Harris will draw lessons from her own experience working with Biden since 2020. This relationship, surely, will inform her selection of a nominee, much like Biden\u2019s experience as vice president under Obama informed his choice four years ago.\n\nIf there are debates between Harris and Trump, what would you like to see them discuss?\n\nI would like to see clear proposals about how we might modernize and fortify the institutions that govern our democracy. When thinking about the future of democracy, it's not enough to speak in generalities. We need to talk and argue about specifics. Following Biden\u2019s recommendation, should we have 18-year term limits for Supreme Court justices? Should we keep the Electoral College? What, precisely, about the administration of elections might be improved?\n\nIf we're going to make actual progress in shoring up our democracy, we need to speak about tangible reforms. I'd like to hear what these candidates have to say about them.\n\nDoes it seem like we\u2019re in unchartered territory, with all of the news in the past several weeks?\n\nIt sure does.\n\nHistorically, there have been instances when an incumbent president withdrew during an election year, as in 1968. There have been previous assassination attempts on presidents, former presidents, and candidates. There have been plenty of elections when uncertainty about a party\u2019s nomination ran right through a brokered convention.\n\nWhat we've been observing over the course of the last month, though, is altogether exceptional: an incumbent president who secured all the delegates needed for the nomination but who withdrew from the campaign just weeks before the convention for reasons that have nothing to do with a political scandal or with a falling out with his party on the basis of policy issues\u2013and a vice president emerging within hours as the new candidate. On split screen, meanwhile, you have Trump not just wielding, but flaunting his total control over the Republican Party, which was only enhanced through this recent assassination attempt; and then him selecting, if not a facsimile, then certainly a loyal servant as his vice president.\n\nAll of this has happened in a matter of weeks. Have we seen some of the elements of this drama before? Sure. Have we seen them strung together in the way that we have this last month? Not even close.",

        "text": "U.S. recognizes opposition candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez as winner of Venezuelan presidential election\nThe U.S. government on Thursday recognized Venezuelan opposition candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez as the winner of the South American country's presidential election, discrediting the results announced by electoral authorities who declared President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro the victor.\n\n\"Given the overwhelming evidence, it is clear to the United States and, most importantly, to the Venezuelan people that Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia won the most votes in Venezuela's July 28 presidential election,\" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement.\n\nThe National Electoral Council declared Maduro the winner of Sunday's highly anticipated election, but the president's main challenger, Gonz\u00e1lez, and opposition leader Maria Corina Machado have said they obtained more than two-thirds of the tally sheets that each electronic voting machine printed after polls closed.\n\nOpposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez rides on top of a truck during a protest against the official results of the presidential elections that declare President Nicolas Maduro the winner in Caracas, Venezuela, on July 30, 2024, two days after. Pedro Rances Mattey/Anadolu via Getty Images\n\nThey said the release of the data on those tallies would prove Maduro lost.\n\nThe announcement from the U.S. government came amid diplomatic efforts to persuade Maduro to release vote tallies from the election and increasing calls for an independent review of the results, according to officials from Brazil and M\u00e9xico.\n\nGovernment officials from Brazil, Colombia and Mexico have been in constant communication with Maduro's administration to convince him that he must show the vote tally sheets from Sunday's election and allow impartial verification, a Brazilian government official told The Associated Press Thursday.\n\nThe officials have told Venezuela's government that showing the data is the only way to dispel any doubt in the results, said the Brazilian official, who asked not be identified because they are not authorized to publicly speak about the diplomatic efforts.\n\nA Mexican official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity for the same reason, confirmed that the three governments have been discussing the issue with Venezuela but did not provide details. Earlier, Mexico President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador said he planned to speak with President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva of Brazil and President Gustavo Petro of Colombia, and that his government believes it's important that the electoral tallies be made public.\n\nLater Thursday, the governments of Brazil, Colombia and Mexico issued a joint statement calling on Venezuela's electoral authorities \"to move forward expeditiously and publicly release\" detailed voting data, but they did not confirm any backroom diplomatic efforts to persuade Maduro's government to publish the vote tallies.\n\n\"The fundamental principle of popular sovereignty must be respected through impartial verification of the results,\" they said in the statement.\n\nVenezuelan President Nicolas Maduro during a press conference at Miraflores Palace in Caracas, Venezuela, on Wednesday, July 31, 2024. Gaby Oraa/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nOn Monday, after the National Electoral Council declared Maduro the winner of the election, thousands of opposition supporters took to the streets. The government said it arrested hundreds of protesters and Venezuela-based human rights organization Foro Penal said 11 people were killed. Dozens more were arrested the following day, including former a opposition candidate, Freddy Superlano.\n\nOpposition leader Machado \u2014 who was barred from running for president \u2014 and Gonz\u00e1lez addressed a huge rally of their supporters in the capital, Caracas, on Tuesday, but they have not been seen in public since. Later that day, the president of the National Assembly, Jorge Rodriguez, called for their arrest, calling them criminals and fascists.\n\nIn an op-ed published Thursday in the Wall Street Journal, Machado said she is \"hiding, fearing for my life, my freedom, and that of my fellow countrymen.\" She reasserted that the opposition has physical evidence that Maduro lost the election and urged the international community to intervene.\n\n\"We have voted Mr. Maduro out,\" she wrote. \"Now it is up to the international community to decide whether to tolerate a demonstrably illegitimate government.\"\n\nOpposition leader Maria Corina Machado and opposition presidential candidate Edmundo Gonzalez raise their hands together during a protest against the result of the presidential election on July 30, 2024 in Caracas, Venezuela Alfredo Lasry R/Getty Images\n\nGovernment repression over the years has pushed opposition leaders into exile. After the op-ed was published, Machado's team told the AP that she was \"sheltering.\" Machado later posted a video on social media calling on supporters to gather Saturday morning across the country.\n\nThe Gonz\u00e1lez campaign had no comment on the op-ed.\n\nOn Wednesday, Maduro asked Venezuela's highest court to conduct an audit of the election, but that request drew almost immediate criticism from foreign observers who said the court is too close to the government to produce an independent review.\n\nIt wasn't clear if Maduro's first concession to demands for more transparency was the result of the discussions with Brazil, Colombia and Mexico. Venezuela's president confirmed during a news conference on Wednesday that he had spoken with Petro about it.\n\nVenezuela's Supreme Tribunal of Justice is closely aligned with Maduro's government. The court's justices are proposed by federal officials and ratified by the National Assembly, which is dominated by Maduro sympathizers.\n\nOn Thursday, the court accepted Maduro's request for an audit and ordered him, Gonz\u00e1lez and the eight other candidates who participated in the presidential election to appear before the justices Friday.\n\nSupporters of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro take part in a rally in Caracas on July 31, 2024. JUAN BARRETO/AFP via Getty Images\n\nGonz\u00e1lez and Machado say they obtained more than two-thirds of the tally sheets printed from electronic voting machines after the polls closed. They said the release of the data on those tallies would prove Maduro lost.\n\nAsked why electoral authorities have not released detailed vote counts, Maduro said the National Electoral Council has come under attack, including cyber-attacks, without elaborating.\n\nThe presidents of Colombia and Brazil \u2014 both close allies of the Venezuelan government \u2014 have urged Maduro to release detailed vote counts.\n\nThe Brazilian official said the diplomatic efforts are only intended to promote dialogue among Venezuelan stakeholders to negotiate a solution to the disputed election. The official said this would include the release of voting data and allowing independent verification.\n\nL\u00f3pez Obrador said Mexico hopes the will of Venezuela's people will be respected and that there's no violence. He added that Mexico expects \"that the evidence, the electoral results records, be presented.\"\n\nPressure has been building on the president since the election.\n\nThe National Electoral Council, which is loyal to Maduro's United Socialist Party of Venezuela, has yet to release any results broken down by voting machine, as it did in past elections. It did, however, report that Maduro received 5.1 million votes, versus more than 4.4 million for Gonz\u00e1lez. But Machado, the opposition leader, has said vote tallies show Gonz\u00e1lez received roughly 6.2 million votes compared with 2.7 million for Maduro.\n\nVenezuela has the world's largest proven crude reserves and once boasted Latin America's most advanced economy, but it entered into free fall after Maduro took the helm in 2013. Plummeting oil prices, widespread shortages and hyperinflation that soared past 130,000% led to social unrest and mass emigration.",

        "text": "US presidential election: JD Vance's missteps\nRepublican vice presidential candidate US Senator JD Vance and his family welcome supporters to the Park Diner in Saint-Cloud, Minnesota, on July 28, 2024. STEPHEN MATUREN / AFP\n\nDistressed comments are proliferating in conservative ranks in tandem with the reappearance of excerpts from interviews embarrassing to JD Vance, Donald Trump's vice presidential nominee. Born into a poor, dysfunctional family, he became a perfect example of social success, experience on which he drew for his 2016 bestseller, Hillbilly Elegy. Until this point, the senator from Ohio had mainly been attacked by Democrats for his radical positions on abortion, whether refusing exceptions in extreme cases such as rape or incest or opposing a woman from his state being able to travel to another, more rights-conscious one to terminate a pregnancy.\n\nRead more Subscribers only J.D. Vance pushes his working-class roots in first speech as Trump's running mate\n\nAmerican voters have discovered that this position was part of a vision of society that pits citizens against each other depending on whether or not they have children. In a 2021 interview with controversial host Tucker Carlson, then on conservative Fox News, Vance mocked Democratic figures including Vice President Kamala Harris and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. He used a misogynist clich\u00e9 of \"childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives.\" He said they \"want to make the rest of the country miserable too\" and have no \"direct stake\" in the good of the nation, as they lack descendants.\n\nHarris has no children, but her husband, Doug Emhoff, has a boy and a girl from a first marriage. Buttigieg, who is openly gay, is raising adopted twins with his husband.\n\nSocial contempt\n\nVance's statement was no blunder. On another occasion, he asserted that \"almost always the people who are most deranged and most psychotic are people who don\u2019t have kids at home.\" In another clip, Vance, speaking with conservative pundit Charlie Kirk, argued for higher taxes for childless people. Vance has the \"remarkable ability to take a long-standing part of the tax code that enjoys broad bipartisan support and make it sound scary and unfair,\" lamented the conservative magazine National Review.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal, which Vance regularly targets as too moderate, also took issue with him in an editorial on July 26. \"Conservatives used to believe in a neutral tax code that didn\u2019t play favorites, but Mr. Vance is suggesting the code should be used as a political and cultural weapon against people who don\u2019t share his values,\" wrote the business daily.\n\nIn the title of its editorial, the Wall Street Journal pointed to a sort of social contempt that it likened to that expressed by 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, when she compared Trump's voters to a \"basket of deplorables.\" She apologized without ever erasing the affront. Asked to take back his words, Vance pleaded humor, adding that he had nothing against cats, or dogs.",

        "text": "Electoral Aftermath in Mexico and the North American Era\nIn the early hours of June 3, 2024, Mexico witnessed a pivotal moment in its political history. After 61% of Mexicans cast their votes, Claudia Sheinbaum emerged as the clear victor of the presidential election, defeating her closest rival, X\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez, by a two-to-one margin.\n\nIn her first speech as president-elect, Sheinbaum expressed gratitude to her competitors and emphasized her party's recent gains of absolute majorities in both houses. She embraced the responsibility of governing with a focus on freedom, honesty, anti-corruption, development, and well-being for all Mexicans. Notably, she highlighted the United States, pledging a relationship based on friendship, mutual respect, and equality. She also committed to defending Mexicans living across the border.\n\nFast forward two months, Sheinbaum\u2019s cabinet is mostly in place, providing a clearer view of her administration's trajectory and its implications for Mexico's bilateral relationship with the United States.\n\nAs Sheinbaum herself has stated, her presidency will serve as a continuation of the legacy left behind by her predecessor, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador (AMLO). This means a commitment to social policies involving cash transfers, raising the minimum wage, enhancing critical infrastructure, and completing major projects like the Mayan Train, Dos Bocas oil refinery, the Interoceanic Train, and two airports. Additionally, she plans to expand passenger rail services nationwide. These projects will operate under a very constrained budget, and aim to keep federal spending low.\n\nIn terms of new policies, a shift in energy policy is anticipated. Sheinbaum supports clean energy and recognizes the need for private investment in the sector. However, she maintains that state-owned companies will continue to dominate the electricity and oil markets. Using clean and green energy is a prerequisite for new investments as it is now fundamental for companies to reach their global sustainable development commitments towards 2030.\n\nOn the security front, Sheinbaum plans to bolster the recently established National Guard, improve coordination with local police, and invest in technology and intelligence; strengthening security is key in a context where more than 58% of companies in Mexico invest between 2 and 10% of their budgets to keep their operations safe. A significant judicial reform is expected in September -still under AMLO\u2019s ruling but with the recently elected legislative power- aiming to overhaul the Supreme Court and other judicial bodies through popular elections. The reform, as currently written, could disrupt the Mexican government\u2019s apparatus and significantly hinder the Mexican economic and democratic stability.\n\nIndustrial and investment policies will prioritize organized \u201cnearshoring,\u201d driving regional development by harnessing each state\u2019s unique strengths. Sheinbaum envisions \u201cWellness Poles\u201d across Mexico, which we believe is achievable only through a dynamic partnership with the private sector to invigorate strategic sectors like semiconductors, medical devices, electromobility, and agriculture. Additionally, investment enablers such as water, energy, and connectivity should be developed. Strengthening North American supply chains is the only way for both countries to counter China\u2019s economic dominance.\n\nUnderstanding the critical importance of U.S. relations, Sheinbaum aims to foster an equal and respectful partnership. The upcoming U.S. presidential election will test her diplomatic skills and political maturity. Ensuring the proper implementation of the USMCA is a priority, and former Foreign Affairs Minister, Marcelo Ebrard, now appointed Minister of Economy, will oversee this crucial task.\n\nSecurity collaboration between Mexico and the U.S. will need a strategic overhaul, focusing on shared objectives and efficient methods to achieve them. The new administration will seek stronger cooperation on development issues, particularly migration and its root causes. The border, a crucial point for trade, security, and migration, presents an opportunity for infrastructure and technological investments to address these issues separately and effectively.\n\nTwo crucial tests for the U.S.-Mexico relationship will come in 2026: the first review of the USMCA as well as the World Cup, to be hosted in cities across North America. It is a historic opportunity that will either showcase a well-organized, forward-thinking alliance or expose chaotic disarray. The region stands at a crossroads, but 2026 is an opportunity to strengthen collaboration and cooperation in North America to ensure regional prosperity.",

Speaking by telephone, Ms Harris said she was \"honoured to be the presumptive nominee\" as the virtual roll call continues ahead of the Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Chicago later this month. Ms Harris is the first black woman and first South Asian woman to become the White House standard-bearer for a major US political party. If she defeats Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, in November she would be America's first female president.\n\nMore on the US election\n\nShe ran unopposed in the virtual roll call after President Joe Biden stepped aside last month and quickly endorsed her. Several potential rivals followed his lead. On Friday afternoon, Ms Harris formally became the nominee after securing the support of 2,350 delegates, the threshold required to earn the nomination. \"We believe in the promise of America and that\u2019s what this campaign is about,\" she said in brief remarks by phone as she crossed the benchmark. \"We are in this, we are on the road and it's not going to be easy, but we\u2019re going to get this done.\" In total, Democrats have said 3,923 delegates - or 99% of the participants - plan to vote for her. The rollcall began on Thursday and ends on Monday. Presidential and vice-presidential nominees are typically anointed at their party conventions, but the relatively late date of the 2024 DNC risks falling afoul of state ballot access laws. Ms Harris, 59, was born in Oakland, California, and is the first Democratic nominee in the party's nearly 200-year history to hail from a western state.\n\nShe rose through the ranks of state politics from San Francisco district attorney to California attorney general and then US senator. Before dropping out of the race, Mr Biden had easily won the Democratic primary. He did not face stiff opposition despite voter concerns about his age and had won backing from 99% of pledged DNC delegates. But the 81-year-old faced escalating pressure from within the party to withdraw after a poor June debate performance against Trump. The decision to hold a virtual nominating process ahead of the 19-22 August convention was made while Mr Biden was still the presumptive candidate. It came in response to rules for ballot access in the state of Ohio, which requires that candidates for the November ballot be formally selected 90 days before the election - or by 7 August. Republican leaders in the state had warned they would enforce the law and, though lawmakers eventually created an exemption as they have done in the past, Democrats said an early rollcall would pre-empt further risks of their candidates being excluded from the ballot. Delegates do not need to vote on the vice-presidential pick. Ms Harris is expected to name her running mate by Monday.",

        "text": "Blinken: Overwhelming evidence Venezuela opposition won election\nOverwhelming evidence Venezuela opposition won election - Blinken\n\nReuters Opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado claims her party's candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez, won by a landslide\n\nThe US secretary of state has said there was \"overwhelming evidence\" Venezuela's opposition won the recent presidential election. In a statement Antony Blinken said it was clear Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez, had won the most votes - despite incumbent president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro declaring a disputed victory. \"Given the overwhelming evidence, it is clear to the United States and, most importantly, to the Venezuelan people that Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia won the most votes in Venezuela's 28 July presidential election,\" Mr Blinken said. His intervention comes as the presidents of Brazil, Mexico and Colombia all called on Venezuela to release the full details of last Sunday's election.\n\nThe US State Department later said Mr Blinken had spoken to Mr Gonz\u00e1lez to congratulate him \"for receiving the most votes\". In a call with Mr Gonz\u00e1lez and the opposition party's leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, Mr Blinken \"expressed his concern for their safety and well-being\" and \"condemned all political violence and repression\". On Friday, Venezuela's election authority ratified Mr Maduro's disputed victory - saying he had won about 52% of votes to Mr Gonz\u00e1lez's 43%, from 97% of votes counted. Mr Maduro accused the opposition of producing fake evidence to contest the result of the election and said the US was behind what he described as a farce and a coup attempt. In a media conference, he also blamed the opposition for spreading false information and encouraging violence in Venezuela. Last Sunday, the electoral council, which is government-controlled, announced President Maduro had won the election for a third term. But this was immediately disputed by the opposition who said, with access to the majority of receipts from electronic voting machines around the country, it was false. The opposition has said its own vote tally shows it won the election by a wide margin. Opinion polls ahead of the election had suggested a clear victory for the challenger. The announcement of Mr Maduro\u2019s victory on Sunday set off deadly protests in Caracas. It has also attracted global criticism, with many governments around the world demanding the Venezuelan government release proof of the result.\n\nEPA Riot police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters in Caracas as thousands demonstrated against the outcome of Sunday's presidential poll\n\nThe result has been recognised by Venezuelan allies China, Russia and Iran. But, the US, European Union and other G7 countries have called on Mr Maduro\u2019s government to release detailed voting data. Posting on social media, Mr Blinken said: \"Electoral data overwhelmingly demonstrate the will of the Venezuelan people: democratic opposition candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez won the most votes in Sunday\u2019s election. \"Venezuelans have voted, and their votes must count.\" The intervention by Mr Blinken is significant. After the last election in 2018 was widely dismissed as neither free nor fair, countries including the US decided to recognise the then-opposition leader Juan Guaido as interim president and imposed sanctions on Venezuela. Mr Blinken said it was \"time for the Venezuelan parties to begin discussions on a respectful, peaceful transition in accordance with Venezuelan electoral law and the wishes of the Venezuelan people\". Argentine Foreign Minister Diana Mondino shared Mr Blinken's view, writing in a post on X, formerly Twitter: \"We can all confirm, without a doubt, that the legitimate winner and President-elect is Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez.\" Ecuador, Uruguay, Costa Rica and Peru have also recognised Mr Gonz\u00e1lez as the president-elect. However, the governments of Brazil, Colombia and Mexico called for an \"impartial verification\" of the result, urging Venezuela to publish voting data broken down by polling stations in a joint statement.",

Gazans weigh in\nTrump or Harris for Gaza Some Palestinians believe that if the new US president aims to impose justice in the world, he or she will impose sanctions on Israel or at least force it to stop its war in Gaza and its violations in the Palestinian Territories. (Jon Cherry, Michelle Zenarosa/Getty Images)\n\nThe impending US elections cast shadows over the ongoing conflict between the Palestinian Hamas movement and Israel in Gaza, as Palestinians hope that the US elections will end the bloody war that has left more than 39,445 Palestinians dead, according to official numbers from the health ministry in Gaza.\n\nA study published in July by the prestigious, peer-reviewed medical journal, Lancet, estimates that Israeli actions since October 2023 could result in over 186,000 deaths in Gaza, with many caused by diseases and other indirect factors rather than direct violence.\n\nThe war came after Hamas launched an attack on Israeli towns adjacent to the Gaza Strip on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people, according to official Israeli statistics.\n\nOver the last 300 days, attitudes on the Israel-Hamas war have shifted, leading to a surge in activism and protests across the United States, including a large-scale college encampment movement. This growing movement has the potential to influence the upcoming presidential election, as both presidential candidates address the heightened public concern and polarized opinions on the conflict.\n\nFor Palestinians, the behavior of Kamala Harris, the current US Vice President and expected Democratic Party candidate, in boycotting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s speech in the US Congress last week offered hope that someone would advocate for justice and help them end the war in the Gaza Strip soon.\n\nAfter meeting Netanyahu in Washington, Harris said that she would not remain silent in the face of the tragedies and suffering, describing the past nine months in Gaza as \u201cdevastating,\u201d especially regarding the killing of children, and called on Netanyahu to immediately stop the war in Gaza.\n\nNearly 11 months in, famine, starvation, shortages of clean water and medicine, and unsanitary conditions in Gaza are causing hunger, disease, and dehydration that are already killing many Palestinians and could surpass the death toll from Israel\u2019s military campaign. A ceasefire is an \u201cabsolute requirement\u201d to turn the hunger crisis around, says WFP Palestine Country Director ad interim Matthew Hollingworth.\n\nIbrahim Salah, a displaced man based in Khan Younis suffering from the dire reality in Gaza, expressed hope for real change in the US position under Harris\u2019s leadership towards what he called the Israeli \u201cgenocide\u201d in the besieged coastal enclave.\n\n\u201cWe felt sadness over the Arab silence during the current war, but the US people and other European populations, let us feel that we are not alone in this war,\u201d Salah said. \u201cCampaigns that tell the US leaders that [the people] will not remain silent, give us more power and more hope that the war will end soon.\u201d\n\nMariam Kamal, a Egypt-based Gazan woman who escaped from death in Gaza four months ago, shared a similar sentiment.\n\n\u201cWhen arrived in Egypt, I thought I will never come back to my Gaza City as I believed that Israel will do its best to evacuate all the Palestinians in Gaza, but when I heard Harris\u2019s speech that said she will not remain silent I returned my hope to see Gaza once again once the war ends,\u201d the 26-year-old accountant said.\n\nShe added, \u201cI know that the current American generation is aware of our suffering, so they will do their best to achieve justice. Harris also knows that very well, so she will never risk her political future in exchange for protecting Israel.\u201d\n\nA slight change and a preferred candidate\n\nNidal Hassouna, a Gaza-based Palestinian political expert, believes that Harris\u2019s statements represent a \u201cslight change\u201d in the US policy toward the ongoing war on Gaza.\n\nHe noted that this may be one of the few times since the beginning of the war that a high-level voice in the US has spoken about \u201cjustice\u201d for Palestinian civilians.\n\nHassouna believes that Harris, who still supports Israel, has no problem criticizing Netanyahu publicly. He also believes that there may be indication that she supports stopping the war, avoiding the occupation of the Gaza Strip, and addressing the dire humanitarian situation in the besieged strip since 2007.\n\nMany Palestinians in Gaza tend to hope that Harris will win over Republican candidate Donald Trump, whom Palestinians consider one of the US presidents who they believe greatly harmed the Palestinian cause.\n\nHanan Alian, an engineer who was displaced to the city of Deir al-Balah, said she would prefer anyone over Trump.\n\n\u201cWe do not have the luxury of following any news due to the circumstances and the power outages since months, but if you ask me who I hope will win, I will say Harris is my favorite candidate,\u201d said Alian, who currently works as a vendor making candies and sweets for families.\n\nAlthough Palestinians do not know much about Harris, they were impressed by her ability to publicly criticize Netanyahu, the ongoing war, and the catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza.\n\n\u201cWe do not prefer Trump to come,\u201d said displaced Ahmed Awad, sitting at the door of his tent in the Al-Mawasi area west of Khan Yunis, south of the Gaza Strip.\n\nPalestinians\u2019 preference for Harris over Trump stems from the former US president\u2019s policy towards Palestinian issues, such as recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel in 2017 and moving the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem the following year. These actions were seen by Palestinians as undermining their aspirations for East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state and as a firm endorsement of Israeli sovereignty over the contested city.\n\nIn 2019, Trump recognized Israeli settlements in the West Bank as legal, in blatant defiance of international law, and halted US support for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). This action was seen as tacit approval of Israel\u2019s expansion into occupied Palestinian territories.\n\n\u201cWe hope that if Harris wins the election, she will put pressure on Israel and put an end to the fighting that has been going on for 10 months,\u201d said Awad, a father of three who lost his home and several family members in an Israeli bombardment of Gaza City last November.\n\nPalestinians in Gaza have expressed satisfaction with the American popular movement and campaigns that were launched to support the Palestinians, such as the US Campaign for Palestinian Rights and the actions organized by Jewish Voices for Peace, and some celebrities like Cardi B and Kehlani who have explicitly called for a ceasefire and an arms embargo on Israel. This, from their point of view, is what caused Biden\u2019s popularity to decline, especially since they hold him responsible for Israel\u2019s persistence in its war on civilians up to this point.\n\nHowever, Palestinians fear that Harris will not be able to achieve a ceasefire or pressure Israel, especially since Netanyahu persistent resistance to ending the conflict in Gaza.\n\nNevertheless, some Palestinians believe that if the new US president aims to impose justice in the world, he or she will impose sanctions on Israel or at least force it to stop its war in Gaza and its violations in the Palestinian Territories.\n\n\u201cI cannot imagine Donald Trump would get a place in the White House once again. Absolutely, he will support Israel forever even if Israel commits more and more massacres against us,\u201d Samia al-Alami, a Gaza-based woman, told Reckon. The 39-year-old mother of four lost her entire family during an Israeli airstrike that attacked her house in al-Yarmouk neighborhood in Gaza City in February.\n\n\u201cNo one can imagine how we live under such war, but Harris, [as a woman], can put herself in our shoes. For a moment if she thinks about us as humans who need only to live in peace, she will never let Israel continue its crimes in Gaza and even in all the Palestinian Territories.\u201d\n\nTrump influence: Could a presidency alter Netanyahu\u2019s stance on Gaza?\n\nIn contrast, political analyst Saleh Lotfi believes that a Trump presidency could alter the grim reality in Gaza and potentially end the war.\n\nLotfi argues that Trump may have more influence over Netanyahu than current President Joe Biden, who has provided absolute support with weapons and money to Israel and visited the country during the war and has recently announced his withdrawal from the presidential race.\n\nTrump has criticized what he described as the weakness of the current US administration that the October 7 attack would not have happened on his watch..\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s public stance against military interventions, his administration aimed to expand Israeli power in the Middle East, exemplified by the controversial Deal of the Century.\n\nLutfi suggests that Trump \u201cwill work to stop the war on Gaza within the framework of a more comprehensive deal represented by normalization with an Arab Muslim country, most likely the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which may make Netanyahu salivate.\u201d\n\nTrump is seen as a favorite of Netanyahu, given their achievements in normalizing relations with Arab nations\u2014the UAE, Bahrain, Morocco, and Sudan\u2014during Trump\u2019s first term.\n\nHowever, both Lotfi and Hassouna agree that both major U.S. parties, the Republicans and Democrats, are likely to continue their strong support for Israel.\n\nA call for US action\n\nRadi Kamal, a displaced resident based in Deir al-Balah, is still dreaming of coming back to his home in Tel al-Hawa neighborhood in the west of Gaza City.\n\nThe 41-year-old father of six was forced to evacuate his area with hundreds of his neighbors to avoid the death. But, he recalls, he had not imagined that his real suffering would start after displacing his house and his city.\n\n\u201cI thought that I would be far away from my house for a few days, but as you see, I have enrolled for the tenth month while I do know if I would survive or even if I would return back to my house,\u201d he lamented.\n\nHe hopes for an end to the war and the possibility of returning home to rebuild his life, urging the world to help end the conflict as soon as possible. He said \u201cit will never be easy, but we can [end it] and we can manage our life once again (...) just I am asking the world to help us stop the mad war as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Palestinian Authority called on the US administration and Congress to pressure Israel and Netanyahu\u2019s government to cease hostilities on Gaza.\n\nNabil Abu Rudeineh, the official spokesman for the Palestinian presidency, accused Israel of violating all the prohibitions established by international law during its war on Gaza.\n\nAbu Rudeineh called on the US administration to force Israel, its strategic ally, to stop its \u201caggression\u201d and comply with international legitimacy decisions and international court decisions, and not to give it support to continue its \u201cbrutal crimes\u201d while it bears responsibility for everything that is happening in Gaza, the West Bank and Jerusalem.\n\nAhmed Masood is a journalist based in Gaza.",

        "text": "Donald Trump and Kamala Harris at odds over presidential debate\nTrump and Harris at odds over presidential debate\n\nThe pair will face off for the presidency when the US goes to the polls on 5 November.\n\nBut Mr Trump says the ABC debate has been \"terminated\" by Mr Biden leaving the race - and has instead pushed for himself and Ms Harris to debate on Fox News on 4 September.\n\nThe Harris campaign is pushing for a debate to take place on ABC News on 10 September, in a slot previously scheduled for a debate between President Joe Biden and Mr Trump.\n\nThe disagreement began after President Biden dropped out of the race on 21 July, with Ms Harris immediately becoming favourite to secure the Democratic nomination.\n\nRelive a wild month in US politics in about two minutes\n\nUS TV networks have been negotiating with both campaigns to arrange new dates.\n\nOn Friday night, Mr Trump wrote on his social network Truth Social that he had accepted Fox News' proposal for a debate on 4 September, which is pencilled to take place in Pennsylvania - a key battleground state.\n\nHe wrote that the moderators would be Fox News\u2019 Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum - and that the rules would be similar to his debate with Mr Biden.\n\n\"If for any reason Kamala is unwilling or unable to debate on that date, I have agreed with Fox to do a major Town Hall on the same September 4th evening,\" he wrote.\n\nMr Trump added that the prior agreement has been terminated because Joe Biden is no longer taking part and because his defamation case against the broadcaster would mean there is a conflict of interest.\n\nThe Harris campaign has responded saying the former president is \"running scared\" and is trying to back out of the agreed debate. They said he\u2019s looking to Fox News \u2013 a conservative cable network - to \"bail him out\".\n\n\u201cHe needs to stop playing games and show up to the debate he already committed to on Sept 10,\" Michael Tyler, Harris Campaign communications director said.\n\nMs Harris followed up on social media, saying it is interesting how \u201cany time, any place\u201d becomes \u201cone specific time, one specific safe space\".\n\n\"I\u2019ll be there on September 10th, like he agreed to,\" she wrote.\n\nMs Harris\u2019 team said they are open to discussing further debates but only after the agreed one takes place.\n\nIf and when the next debate does happen it will be keenly watched to see how the two contenders match up.\n\nMs Harris secured enough pledges to become the Democratic nominee on Friday.\n\nDuring a campaign rally in Atlanta on Wednesday, Ms Harris challenged Mr Trump to debate her, saying \u201cif you got something to say, say it to my face\".\n\nThe debate news comes just hours after a report by the Homeland Security Department revealed that the US Secret Service made mistakes in their response to the 6 January attack on the US Capitol.\n\nMs Harris, who was then vice-president-elect, came within 20ft (6m) of a \"viable\" pipe bomb planted outside the Democratic National Committee's headquarters in Washington.\n\nThat bomb - and a similar one found at the Republican National Committee headquarters - were placed near the buildings the night before Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol. It remains unclear who planted both pipe bombs.",

        "text": "The DNC's virtual roll call to nominate Kamala Harris started Aug. 1. Here's how the vote works.\nUpdate: The Democratic Party announced on Friday, Aug 2., that Kamala Harris has received enough delegate votes to secure the presidential nomination. Read more here.\n\nDemocratic Party delegates began voting in a virtual roll call on Thursday morning, Aug. 1, to select their new nominee, part of the process to formally elevate Vice President Kamala Harris to the top of the ticket for November. Harris is running unopposed, since no other candidate met the requirements to qualify. Here's more on what it means and how the vote will work:\n\nWho gets to vote?\n\nThe nearly 4,000 pledged delegates allocated during the Democratic primary process will be voting on the nomination.\n\nDo Biden's delegates automatically go to Harris?\n\nThe vast majority of the party's delegates were pledged to President Biden before he dropped out and endorsed Harris. These delegates weren't automatically assigned to Harris, but within the 48 hours of her campaign launch, an overwhelming majority of the delegates said they would back her.\n\nIs anyone challenging Kamala Harris for the Democratic nomination?\n\nUnder DNC rules, Harris' presidential campaign \u2014 and anyone seeking to challenge her \u2014 had to file paperwork with the DNC and obtain digital signatures from at least 300 delegates, with no more than 50 from a single state, by July 30 at 6 p.m. ET.\n\nNo challenger met that threshold to contest Harris' nomination; instead, the most likely figures quickly backed her nomination. At this point, she is the presumptive nominee, and the vote is largely ceremonial.\n\nIn the days since Mr. Biden dropped out and endorsed her, Harris has won endorsements from more than 3,000 of the 4,000 pledged delegates. She ended up with 3,923 delegate signatures during the qualifying period. The number of delegate votes she needs in the virtual roll call to secure the nomination is 1,976.\n\nHow will the DNC's virtual roll call work?\n\nThe committee's rules established that if only one candidate qualified, the party would hold a roll call vote virtually as soon as Aug. 1 \u2014 not in person at its mid-August convention in Chicago.\n\nParty leaders announced Tuesday night that delegates would be able to vote electronically beginning at 9 a.m. ET on Thursday, Aug. 1. The voting will conclude at 6 p.m. ET on Monday, Aug. 5.\n\nDelegates are voting through an online platform run by the DNC, using a personalized and watermarked form sent over email. They can either send the form back or have the DNC call them to cast their vote. Ballots are being sent on a rolling basis, and the process is expected to take several days. Once the votes are in, the DNC will tally them and share the full results after the roll call is closed.\n\n\"Each roll call form has a range of security features to establish the authenticity and accuracy of each vote. Clear instructions and technical support will be provided to delegates,\" the DNC has said.\n\nThe process for the virtual roll call and the gathering of delegate signatures largely mirrors the process used in 2020, during the pandemic.\n\nAutomatic delegates or \"superdelegates,\" such as Democratic governors, members of Congress and former presidents, also have a vote in the signature threshold and the roll call process. The DNC says because Harris got the verified support of a majority of pledged delegates, the votes of both pledged delegates and superdelegates will count on the first ballot of the virtual roll call.\n\nThe DNC said it will share the full results of the roll call after it is completed, but it's unclear when or whether they will make an announcement once Harris passes the threshold needed to secure a majority of delegates.\n\nWill Harris and her running mate be nominated at the same time?\n\nWhile the DNC has said that option is possible, the vice presidential candidate does not have to be nominated at the same time as the presidential nominee. Harris must pick a running mate by Aug. 7 to comply with Ohio's current ballot deadline, which remains in effect. Harris' team is planning to finish the vetting of the VP field and expects her to pick her running mate by Aug. 5, sources familiar with the process say.\n\nSometime after Harris makes her pick, Moore will declare her choice the nominee. There is no separate vote on the vice presidential pick. At the in-person convention in Chicago, there will be ceremonial votes for Harris and her running mate, but the ticket will have been established by then.\n\nWhy is the DNC holding an early virtual roll call vote before the convention?\n\nIn May, the DNC made a push for a virtual process because of Ohio's Aug. 7 deadline for major parties to submit the names of their certified candidates for the November ballot.\n\nWhile Ohio Republicans passed a law to push that deadline to Sept. 1, it will not go into effect until then. Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, says Ohio would honor that Sept. 1 deadline. But the DNC and members say the possibility of legal challenges by other outside groups, such as the conservative Heritage Foundation, creates unnecessary risk.\n\n\"If we take chances with state processes and deadlines, Republican groups could make the argument to challenge Democratic votes on the post-election side, arguing that our nominee should never have been on the ballot in the first place,\" said DNC outside counsel Pat Moore.",

        "text": "Boosts in Democratic excitement help Harris reset the race against Trump \u2014 CBS News poll\nBoosted by Democrats, younger and Black voters becoming more engaged and likely to vote, and by women decidedly thinking she'd favor their interests more, Vice President Kamala Harris has reset the 2024 presidential race.\n\nShe has a 1-point edge nationally \u2014 something President Biden never had (he was down by 5 points when he left the race) \u2014 and Harris and former President Donald Trump are tied across the collective battleground states.\n\nLooking ahead, voters are also defining why the next few weeks could be critical.\n\nOn one hand, Harris has additional edges with the wider electorate that Mr. Biden did not: she's leading Trump on being seen as having the cognitive health to serve, a measure that was of course central to the campaign before Mr. Biden stepped aside.\n\nAnd on policy generally, Harris is seen as a little different from Mr. Biden, opening some possibility of defining her stances for the electorate now, either way.\n\nBut to Trump's advantage, some critical things have not changed: he keeps his sizable lead on voters saying they'll be financially better off with him and that his policies would decrease migrants at the border.\n\nThe percentage of Democrats who say they'll \"definitely vote\" has risen to its highest point this year. That narrows the partisan \"turnout gap\" we've seen throughout the campaign.\n\nAnd today much higher numbers of Black voters say they'll vote, compared to July when Mr. Biden was the nominee.\n\nMore generally, all this points to how the election might well hinge on turnout and specifically on marginal-turnout voter \u2014 those who don't always show up to vote.\n\nFor example, among those who generally describe themselves as \"sometimes\" or \"rarely\" voting \u2014 but say they'll definitely vote now \u2014 Harris is currently winning.\n\nThe women's vote\n\nHarris is leading among women voters \u2014 an edge Democrats have had and needed in recent history \u2014 with at least one big reason why: Women voters overwhelmingly think Harris would help women's interests if elected. Far fewer women say that about Trump.\n\nVoters overall tend to think Trump would help the interests of men more than they think he'd help those of women.\n\nRelated to this, the gender gap has widened some from earlier in the campaign. Harris leads Trump among women by a bigger margin than Mr. Biden had, while holding roughly the same support Mr. Biden had among men.\n\nEnthusiasm and core Democratic groups\n\nMost Democratic voters, and nearly half of voters overall, say that Harris as the Democratic nominee makes them feel more motivated to vote. (There is some countering effect, too: about a third of Trump voters are also more motivated to vote now that Harris is the nominee.)\n\nIt's not just that Democrats are more excited, but also on a number of candidate qualities they feel they've gotten a candidate that can match up more closely with Trump.\n\nHarris has an advantage over Trump on being seen as having the mental and cognitive health to serve, which was a critical deficit for Mr. Biden.\n\nAcross the wider set of voters, she's ahead of Trump on being energetic and focused (two qualities Mr. Biden trailed Trump badly on). She's even with Trump on perceived competence, and closer than Mr. Biden was on being tough and effective.\n\nBlack voters\n\nHarris now has levels of support among Black voters that is closer to what Mr. Biden had in 2020 and higher than Mr. Biden was getting in polling this year.\n\nBlack voters think Harris will look out for everyone, including Black people.\n\nRepublicans and Trump voters think Harris will help the interests of Black people more so than of White people; Harris' voters think she'll look out for everyone across gender and race lines.\n\nTrump's voters also think he'll help the interests of everyone, though the wider electorate tends to think he'll help the interests of men and White people more so than others.\n\nMore widely, as voters assess where the country is, most say the country is ready to elect a Black woman as president, and that spans people voting for Harris and many who are not. It includes about three-quarters of independents and almost half of Republicans.\n\nFor some historical context, the 21st century has brought a shift in these kinds of views; back in 2000 just over a third had thought the nation was ready to elect a Black president. That had changed in CBS News polling in 2008 when Barack Obama was running, and then most said the country was ready to do so.\n\nOn policy and issues: What's changed, what's the same?\n\nHarris' policy views are seen as mostly \u2014 but not entirely \u2014 the same as Mr. Biden's, opening the question of how the campaigns may spend the coming weeks looking to define those differences in the public mind.\n\nVoters do see her as somewhat or very liberal. (The more conservative one is, the more likely they are to view her as very liberal.) Then again, voters see Trump as very or somewhat conservative \u2014 and so that choice is more polarized than the electorate as a whole.\n\nOn having policies that will improve people's finances: Harris opens in the same position as Mr. Biden was in July, trailing Trump substantially.\n\nHalf think Harris' policies would increase the number of migrants trying to cross the border, similar to Mr. Biden, but that Trump's would decrease that.\n\nOn protecting abortion: A majority think Harris will try to pass a national law making abortion legal.\n\nHarris has been arguing that Trump will ban abortion nationwide if he gets back into office, but she may have more work to do convincing voters of that. Trump has said he'd leave the matter to the states, and voters are more inclined to think he will do just that.\n\nLooking ahead to the VP pick\n\nOn the whole most Democrats aren't explicitly calling on Harris to pick a man, or to pick a woman as her running mate, and some are thinking strategically that the pick should be from a battleground state.\n\nThe impact of third parties\n\nWith third-party candidates included (though not all are on the ballot in all states), Harris' national lead is similar, at two points.\n\nState-level estimates\n\nIn addition to our national polling, we have updated state-level estimates available for the seven battleground states that are derived from CBS News' statistical model \u2013 which incorporates this survey data as well as multiple other data. All estimates are within the margin of error, further underpinning the larger point of an even race.\n\nThis CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a representative sample of 3,102 registered voters nationwide interviewed between July 30-August 2nd, 2024. The survey included an oversample of Black respondents. The final sample as reported was weighted according to gender, age, race, and education based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as to 2020 presidential vote. Respondents were selected to be representative of registered voters nationwide. The margin of error for registered voters is \u00b12.1 points. Battlegrounds are AZ GA MI NC NV PA WI.\n\nToplines\n\ncbsnews_20240804_SUN by CBSNews.com on Scribd",

        "text": "Ask an expert: Pop culture in the 2024 presidential election\nUNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. \u2014 When Kamala Harris announced her candidacy for president, two questions were at the forefront of social media memes: Who would she select for her running mate, and had Maya Rudolph cleared her schedule to reprise her Harris impression for Saturday Night Live?\n\nPolitics permeates pop culture, and vice versa, especially during presidential elections. Penn State News spoke with three faculty experts to learn more about how people can best parse politics in pop culture, as well as how to take care in a saturated media landscape.\n\nWael Jabr, assistant professor of supply chain and information systems at the Penn State Smeal College of Business, studies, among other topics, how social media shapes political discourse.\n\nMichele Ramsey, associate professor of communication art and sciences and of women\u2019s, gender and sexuality studies at Penn State Berks, researches representations of gender in the media as well as rhetoric on women\u2019s rights, social movements and politics.\n\nS. Shyam Sundar, Evan Pugh University Professor and the James P. Jimirro Professor of Media Effects in the Penn State Donald P. Bellisario College of Communications, investigates the uses and effects of digital media, online news sources, fake news and misinformation, social media effects and the social and psychological aspects of artificial intelligence.\n\nQ: Can celebrities and social media influencers like Taylor Swift sway voters? How do influencers compare to the impact of traditional media on politics?\n\nJabr: Celebrities and social media influencers can, and quite often do, sway voters. Some feel an obligation to weigh in on political matters. Others weigh in on social matters that have a strong influence on elections.\n\nWhile we\u2019re used to influencers like Taylor Swift with a huge following of more than a quarter of a billion Instagram users, we\u2019re witnessing more recently a newer type of \u201cmicro-influencer\u201d with a follower base of just a few thousand. These influencers are closer to the pulse of the community. They are interested in local issues, such as potholes on their main street or how to support their local eateries. So, when they make a political statement, it resonates with their followers.\n\nInfluence is a combination of things: the more I hear it, the more valid I believe it is; if I hear it from different sources, that is also impactful. There is also the on-demand feature of social media and its infinite scrolling. These influencers have a megaphone that amplifies information. Take for example this experiment on Twitter in Denmark from a couple years ago. The researchers concluded that when we are repeatedly exposed to an idea, typically from many sources, we are more likely to adopt it and reshare it, what psychologists call the repeated exposure effect.\n\nSundar: Celebrities may not directly tell their fans how to vote, but they can leverage their popularity to shape politics in other ways. They often publicly endorse candidates and platform positions. They can provide star power for political fund-raising events. This can mean a lot in the political process and automatically gives them a voice. For example, when George Clooney wrote an op-ed piece in the New York Times urging President Biden to relinquish his candidacy for the 2024 elections, one of the first things Clooney mentioned was his successful fund-raising efforts for Democratic Party candidates.\n\nQ: How does the personalization of a social media newsfeed skew a person\u2019s perception of political issues?\n\nRamsey: Now that media has become so siloed, meaning that we all see things in our algorithms that reflect and encourage what we already believe and like, our perceptions of cultural and political issues are no longer common. It has always been the case that we have different opinions on the things happening in our country, but we generally shared the same media and thus also a similar reality. Algorithms and their impact on what we see has changed that. We have entire populations that do not even share the same reality. As such, it is not just the case that perceptions of political issues are skewed these days because of social media. Now perceptions of reality itself are skewed \u2014 and in many cases, just plain incorrect.\n\nHow do you talk with someone who doesn\u2019t believe something that is scientifically proven, such as climate change? How do you persuade that person? How do you counteract incorrect information that is being fed to them through an algorithm designed to make money off of their engagement rather than functioning in a way that better protects democracy? Many of the people who created tools that allow for the silo effect of social media now attempt to undo the damage their creation has done; some even formed the Center for Humane Technology to sound warning bells about the impacts of algorithms on our democracy, mental health and relationships.\n\nJabr: Personalization algorithms are intended to give us more of the same \u2014 the same content that we typically like and engage with. So, inherently, with the way social media algorithms work, we may be stuck in echo-chambers, in our own bubbles. Ideally, we should be able to expect that social media platforms and influencers would act ethically and in the interest of social welfare. But frankly, that is a tough ask. This is because social media is most often a numbers game \u2014 number of followers, specifically \u2014 and how to monetize them.\n\nNow, these algorithms are available on social media but not on traditional media. Yet traditional media is also playing a numbers game for viewers, and what they can\u2019t achieve through personalization they make up for through polarizing their reporting. This makes us all, young or old, social media aficionados or traditional media fanatics, prone to becoming siloed and to having our perceptions skewed. One has to recognize these issues to be able to overcome them.\n\nQ: How do politics influence pop culture? How does pop culture influence politics, or the perception of politics?\n\nRamsey: Ideology is most powerful when it\u2019s least visible. When we are being entertained, we are often less likely to critically assess the ideologies about things like race, class and sex/gender, or a specific political issue, because it\u2019s \u201cjust entertainment.\u201d As a result, we may be more easily influenced by a popular song or film narrative than, say, a political advertisement where ideologies are more clearly communicated and expected. We need to understand the ideological power of the media to influence our ideas about who we are, who we want to be and how we see the world.\n\nPopular culture helps shape our views of the world and its politics through what stories we choose to pay attention to in things like television, film, music and social media posts on platforms like TikTok. At the same time, people tasked with the job of making sure politicians are relatable to voters are going to pay attention to popular culture and make attempts to connect themselves to memes, people, trends or whatever else in the media people are paying attention to, whether positive or negative. Conversely, some popular culture can obfuscate issues and confuse people \u2014 unintentionally or purposefully \u2014 and some can shed light on issues and help people see things they didn\u2019t see before, whether those things are true or not.\n\nQ: The election cycle can feel overwhelming, especially as it permeates traditional and social media. What is mindfulness and how might it be applied during the election cycle?\n\nSundar: The election cycle is overwhelming in that it adds to the information overload that social media users are already struggling with on their phones and other devices. This kind of overload situation is known to encourage mindless consumption of information. People may not pay close attention to the sources or veracity of information. They are more likely to fall for fake news. They may not stop to think that their social media friends are not trained in journalism and therefore do not know how to vet or verify facts. So, the solution is not to endlessly scroll through your feeds on your mobile devices, but to be more mindful in consuming political news. One strategy would be to subscribe to a manageable set of professional news sources. If these sources have known political biases, then it would be a good idea to factor that in when consuming information from them. It would also be a good idea to subscribe to a politically diverse set of news sources to gain a better perspective.\n\nJabr: Mindfulness for me starts with trying to break the algorithmic bubble that we can get stuck in. The way to do that is through injecting some randomness in our choices to \u201ctrip\u201d that algorithm. If my views lean to the left or to the right, it helps to click on content from the opposing side, which may lead the algorithm to think I am more centrist.\n\nMindfulness can also be done through setting limits. Because social media allows infinite scrolling, one can keep scrolling for an endless time, so one has to make sure they take breaks.\n\nI also recommend maintaining contact with nature and maintaining social contacts with family and with friends: Take breaks from the media and have walks in the park, attend social events and so on.\n\nFor more information or to speak with one of our election experts, visit media.psu.edu or contact mediarelations@psu.edu.",

Inflation skyrocketed and shortages of basic goods became widespread.\n\nWaves of anti-government protests in 2014 and 2017 fizzled out after a police crackdown.\n\nMillions of Venezuelans left the country to escape economic hardship and political repression. Amid growing discontent, Mr Maduro was re-elected in 2018 in a presidential election widely dismissed as neither free nor fair.",

        "text": "5 things to know about CBS News' 2024 Battleground Tracker election poll analysis\nThe CBS News Battleground Tracker is back, explaining what's on voters' minds and regularly providing detailed snapshots of the U.S. presidential election in each state throughout the 2024 campaign. In addition to the specific polls we conduct in key states in a given week, the Battleground Tracker map includes our best estimates and presidential race ratings in every state. This includes states we've polled extensively and states where we've surveyed fewer voters but have lots of other data. Scroll down to the end to see CBS News' latest battleground state estimates (you can also hover over the map to see estimates).\n\nWhat exactly is the Battleground Tracker, and where do the numbers come from? Here are five things to know.\n\n1. Going state by state to understand this election\n\nWe take a state-by-state approach to describing the race and measuring public opinion, since the presidency is won in the Electoral College, not by the national popular vote. Indeed, relying too much on national polling can be misleading, as 2016 reminded us.\n\nThe Battleground Tracker looks at each individual state, focusing on the most competitive ones. And we translate each candidate's current support to the electoral vote scoreboard. Our state-by-state approach also gives a sense of what voters in different parts of the country think and feel about this year's candidates, national issues and local matters.\n\n2. More than just a poll\n\nWhile surveying voters across the country is an integral part of the Battleground Tracker, this is more than your typical poll. It's really a big data project. We combine polling, voter files from L2 Data (L2 is the firm used by CBS News for voter files), U.S. Census data, and historical trends to get a clear picture of what's going on in each state.\n\nHere's what the data tells us:\n\nWe know which candidates different types of voters are supporting from our polling, which includes much larger sample sizes \u2014 tens of thousands \u2014 than a typical poll;\n\nWe know how many people like them are in each state and county, as well as their turnout history, from voter files and U.S. Census data;\n\nAnd we know each state's previous election results, which enables us to anchor our 2024 estimates to recent history.\n\nOur model combines all this data using multilevel regression with post-stratification (scroll down for more details on this). A feature of this technique is that we use trends across the country to inform our picture of a specific state. If we find Hispanic voters across the Southwest shifting support, for instance, we use the information to more precisely estimate specific states in which Hispanic voters live. The same applies for many other types of voters. The survey lets them tell us what they are thinking, and we map that to how many of them live in each state.\n\nWe collaborate on data collection and modeling with global opinion research firm YouGov, building on our successful efforts in 2018, 2020, and 2022.\n\n3. Think snapshots, not forecasts\n\nWe tell you where races stand today, explaining why and what might change. We fully anticipate movement before the first vote is cast, so we'll update everything regularly in the months ahead.\n\nUnlike an electoral forecast, we're estimating each candidate's current support, incorporating all the data we've collected up to this point. For instance, if we estimate President Biden at 49% in a state with a margin of error of 3 points, we're confident that his support there is between 46% and 52% today \u2014 not that the final result will be in that range.\n\nThere's nothing here to account for forward-looking uncertainty \u2014 nothing about the economy changing or dramatic debates, for example. We fully expect movement before the first vote is cast, so we'll update everything regularly throughout the fall. A race that's leaning toward a party today could be reclassified as a toss-up if it becomes more competitive.\n\n4. Electoral scenarios\n\nThat brings us to scenarios. Down the road, the Battleground Tracker will offer plausible scenarios for how the election might unfold. We'll do this using a combination of statistical simulation and by tweaking some of the assumptions underlying our model, resulting in a range of possible outcomes.\n\nHere's an example. One of the most challenging things to figure out will be turnout: who's actually going to bother to vote? Modeling who is likely to vote is a perennial challenge that is sensitive to assumptions.\n\nIn our baseline model, we estimate which voters are casting ballots based on both what they tell us they're planning to do and historical patterns in their states. In our scenarios, we'll slightly alter the model's parameters to explore what could happen if, for example, large swaths of voters stay home (perhaps for fear of getting sick) or if there's a surge in voting by mail (also possible given intense interest in this election). We'll roll out our scenarios later in the campaign, so check back for them!\n\n5. Models have solid track record\n\nWhile we take a different approach than traditional polling, the Battleground Tracker is based on rigorous methods from the fields of political science, survey research, and statistics. Moreover, we have a strong track record employing similar models at CBS News over the past few years.\n\nOur 2018 model performed particularly well, steadily tracking Democrats' improvement in key races and the eventual blue wave in the U.S. House. In fact, our high-turnout scenario accurately estimated the final seat breakdown, when it came to pass that historic turnout powered Democratic gains.\n\nOur accurate race ratings in 2020 were based on a similar model. We estimated that Democrats had built a lead heading into Election Day, but that Republicans could catch up with a late turnout surge. Every state we classified as leaning Democratic wound up going to Mr. Biden, and each we rated as leaning Republican went to Trump. Of our six toss ups, Trump won four and Mr. Biden won two.\n\nAnd most recently, this methodology enabled us to accurately estimate the 2022 midterm elections. Our model consistently pointed to narrow Republican gains in the House, rather than the red wave that many other analysts expected.\n\nNEW Battleground Tracker estimates out today\n\n\n\nRs still ahead in race for House heading into final week of campaign \u2014 baseline model sees slight shift to GOP\n\n\n\nEight in ten voters say things are \"out of control\" in U.S.\n\n\n\nExplore *range* of possibilities here https://t.co/rAA68pkcsw pic.twitter.com/EG7x52dgn5 \u2014 Kabir K. (@kabir_here) October 30, 2022\n\nMore on the statistical model we use\n\nIf you want to know more about the data and statistical model we use \u2014 and don't mind a bit of jargon \u2014 then keep reading...\n\nFirst, we survey thousands of registered voters across the country and make sure to draw larger samples in battleground states, which we expect to be more competitive. The most important survey questions we ask for estimation purposes are how likely they are to vote and which candidate they would vote for today.\n\nWe then determine how people's vote intentions are related to their characteristics like age, gender, race, education, past vote, where they live, and so on. Each voter has a certain combination, which we'll call a \"profile\" for shorthand. For example, one possible profile is a 45-year-old, Asian female, who holds a college degree, voted for Biden four years ago, and lives in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. Change any one of these characteristics and you get a different profile. We run a multilevel regression \u2014 a way to model the relationship between different variables \u2014 on the survey data to estimate how many voters of each specific profile intend to vote for each major candidate. The regression includes the voter characteristics above, as well as state and district effects (the levels in \"multilevel\").\n\nThe next step is estimating how many people of each voter profile live in each state. For this we use a combination of U.S. census data and voter files, which includes counts of voters at very granular levels, such as voting precincts. In each state, we multiply the total number of voters of a given profile by the proportion of voters with that profile choosing a candidate (the \"post-stratification\" step). Aggregating across all voter profiles in a state, we finally get the estimate of that candidate's statewide vote share. In Maine and Nebraska \u2014 the two states that award electoral votes by congressional district \u2014 we also estimate candidate support in each district.",

        "text": "Kamala Harris poised to announce vice-presidential choice\nKamala Harris poised to announce her running mate\n\nGetty Images Kamala Harris will hold campaign events in seven cities this week, beginning with a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday\n\nVice-President Kamala Harris is expected to announce her running mate by Tuesday morning, ending two weeks of intense speculation as the US hurtles towards November's presidential election. Ms Harris interviewed several top contenders in Washington DC over the weekend, including Josh Shapiro, Tim Walz and Mark Kelly. Her choice will join her on a whirlwind five-day tour of seven cities this week as Ms Harris ramps up her campaign in key battleground states. The most recent poll from CBS, the BBC's US partner, shows Ms Harris and Trump in a tight race nationally, with the Democrat holding a one-point lead over her Republican challenger.\n\nThe poll released on Sunday shows Trump and Ms Harris tied in battleground states, where the former president held a five-point lead while Joe Biden remained in the race. Following the announcement expected on Tuesday morning, a campaign video will be released before Ms Harris and her new running mate jointly hold a rally in Philadelphia that evening. She reportedly met her vetting team - led by former US attorney general Eric Holder - over the weekend and received in-depth presentations on their findings, including potential political vulnerabilities. She met three of those candidates - Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Arizona Senator Mark Kelly and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro - on Sunday. She also met another top contender - Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg - on Friday and is understood to have spoken with other candidates virtually, US media report. On Monday afternoon, in response to a report that Ms Harris had made her pick, a campaign spokesperson, Kevin Munoz, wrote on social media that she was still deciding. \"We understand the excitement and interest here, but VP Harris has made no decision on a running mate yet!\" he said. It comes as the DNC finished a virtual roll call vote that saw Ms Harris officially become the first black and South Asian American nominee for a major US party's White House campaign. The Harris campaign has met with a flurry of lobbying efforts on behalf of - or criticising - the candidates. Mr Shapiro, for example, has drawn sharp opposition from some left-wing groups for his support of private school vouchers in Pennsylvania - a Republican-backed proposal to send $100m to families for private school tuition and school supplies - as well as his pro-Israel views.\n\nThe Philadelphia event will be followed by a string of campaign events across Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Georgia and Arizona, before ending with a campaign event in Las Vegas, Nevada, on 10 August. Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, have both suggested that Ms Harris' choice of running mate will ultimately have no impact on the upcoming election. In an episode of the \"Full Send\" podcast aired on Friday, Mr Vance said he believed the vice-presidential choice \"doesn't really matter, as much as this hits my ego\". \"People are going to vote primarily for Donald Trump or for Kamala Harris,\" he said. \"That's the way these things go.\" Similarly, Trump has largely shrugged off questions about Ms Harris's choice, arguing last week that the vice-presidential role \"does not have any impact\". On Sunday, however, Trump criticised Mr Shapiro on Fox News, saying that Ms Harris could lose \"her little Palestinian base\" if she chooses him. Mr Shapiro, who during his student days wrote in a college magazine that Palestinians were \"too battle minded\", told reporters on Friday that he now supported a two-state solution.",

        "text": "What does it mean to 'endorse' a presidential candidate?\nIn presidential election years, certain words pop up in our lookup data\u2014words that get dusted off for a short while before receding from the news, put back in the closet until we need them again. These words, like caucus, presumptive, and electoral college, are generally used infrequently, but election years make them, for a brief time, favorites among our lookups.\n\nAlthough \"endorse\" has been used in English for more than 600 years, the figurative meaning of \u201cto approve openly\u201d is much newer\n\nBut some words do the hard work year in and year out, rising in popularity during an election year because of a less common meaning that is temporarily prominent. Endorse is such a word. It carries a lot of meaning on its back, and for good reason: it comes from the Latin word dorsum, meaning \u201cback.\u201d\n\nDorsum is the root of dorsal, meaning \u201crelating to or situated near or on the back especially of an animal,\u201d as in dorsal fin. That literal meaning of \u201con the back\u201d is also the origin of endorse, which has meant \u201cto write on the back of a document\u201d in texts going back to before 1400. (Endorsement followed endorse in the mid-1500s.) For centuries the word's meanings were restricted to ones that required a writing implement, with the act of endorsing involving a simple signature (as in \u201cendorsing a check\u201d), or a more elaborate note functioning, for example, as approval of a military promotion.\n\nThe figurative meaning \u201cto approve openly\u201d or \u201cto express support or approval of openly and definitely\u201d is a relatively modern development, dating to the 1800s. An early use makes reference to the nominating convention of the Democratic Party in 1844, but could easily be imagined as a line from election coverage today; only the names would change:\n\nCol. Benton endorses Polk and Dallas, but almost directly denounces the Convention which nominated them.\n\n\u2014The Brooklyn Evening Star, 28 June 1844\n\nEndorsements involving approval weren\u2019t initially limited to political contexts; an early use by Ralph Waldo Emerson in 1847, cited in the Oxford English Dictionary, shows broader application, with ideas and authors enjoying endorsements as well:\n\nThis book of Montaigne the world has endorsed, by translating it into all tongues.\n\nWith its origins in binding legal documents at a time when the written word was precious and the tradition of written laws was being established in England, endorse has retained its strong meaning: putting your name behind a candidate means, figuratively, carrying that candidate\u2019s record, reputation, and actions on your back.",

        "text": "Stanford Scholars Discuss What\u2019s at Stake in the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election\nThe panelists began their election analysis with a discussion of the structural features of American democracy and then addressed the issues, strategies, and stakes central to November\u2019s race.\n\nCain began his remarks by highlighting a longstanding and escalating concern about the American democratic structure: tension between electability and governance. Rather, that the negative partisanship necessary during the election process has proven incompatible with the bipartisan negotiations required to govern. This, coupled with campaign finance \u2014 which, among other things, has complicated the incentive and power structures of political parties \u2014 has fueled inefficiency and political frustration.\n\nJefferson argued that a persistent feature of American democracy is the influence of race on political outcomes. While various identities may shape Americans' political attitudes and behaviors, race, he contended, is unparalleled in its impact. As one example, Black Americans have long been \"steadfast Democrats,\" while no Democratic Party nominee has received a majority of the white vote since 1964.\n\nReferring to comparative politics scholarship, Jefferson noted that, in some ways, the Republican Party functions as an \"ethnic party.\" He pointed out that Trump\u2019s success in generating and consolidating his base is directly tied to white identity politics. Trump has relied on grievance politics to gain power, speaking to white, middle-class American voters who feel left behind and resentful of what they believe is a changing racial order. Positioning himself as their spokesman and defender, Trump attempts to reassure these voters that, if he returns to power, he will defend their place in America's racial hierarchy.\n\nWhile Cain and Jefferson touched on American democracy\u2019s organizing features, Canes-Wrone brought the conversation back to the current election cycle, highlighting prediction models and key issues. The polls, Canes-Wrone believes, are accurate, yet with such slim confidence intervals, the election is still too close to call.\n\nContrary to popular portrayal in the media, historical evidence suggests that bounces from the convention and vice presidential picks are rarely pivotal, if impactful at all. However, qualifies Canes-Wrone, this cycle is unprecedented, leaving an opportunity for a break in the trend.\n\nMoving to discuss the issues, Canes-Wrone underscores that the candidates are following traditional political strategy \u2014 placing emphasis on the issues that favor them and de-emphasis on those that don\u2019t. The Harris campaign has focused its efforts on abortion rights and threats to democracy, whereas Trump remains fixated on immigration and the economy. Unfortunately for Harris, post-COVID inflation and immigration remain the top issues, and her position is further complicated by the inability to heavily criticize her own administration.\n\nTo conclude their remarks, the panelists turned to the issue of gender: is the United States really ready to have a woman in the presidency? Canes-Wrone remarked that while survey data indicates that gender bias on the issue has diminished, it is not yet zero. In other political offices, women now win at equal rates to men, but with one caveat \u2014 far more expertise is required. There also appears to be far more sexism attached to executive offices, a reality Trump is likely to exploit. Perhaps luckily for Harris, there is one traditional argument the Republican nominee may have difficulty leveraging against her: it's not so easy to argue that a former prosecutor isn't tough on crime.",

        "text": "Q&A: Law professor addresses Kamala Harris\u2019s unprecedented presidential campaign\nProfessor Sonia Gipson Rankin is a Professor of Law at The University of New Mexico School of Law. Her work focuses on the legal and justice implications of new technologies like artificial intelligence, implicit bias, and criminal justice reform, as well as racial justice and Black community empowerment.\n\nProfessor Sonia Gipson Rankin\n\nShe has spoken with numerous media outlets about U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019s role in President Joe Biden\u2019s White House administration, as well as Harris\u2019s own 2020 and 2024 presidential campaigns.\n\nQ: In such an unprecedented situation are there any legal concerns with having a democratic candidate that wasn't in the primaries?\n\nSo, there may be some legal challenges, but there are no legal concerns. The Democratic nominee will not be officially selected until the Democratic Convention later in August. There is nothing unlawful because though President Biden was the presumptive nominee, he was not yet the official nominee nor was he on any ballots before he said he was leaving the race. Each party decides how it would like to determine its nominee. The Democratic Party will hold a virtual roll call starting August 1st and Vice President Kamala Harris is running unopposed as no challenger met the thresholds required to challenge her. She received over 3,000 of the 4,000 pledged delegates. So, as of right now, we have not seen that there have been any legal concerns that might stop the process.\n\nQ: Within just a few days of President Joe Biden announcing he would not run for re-election, Vice President Kamala Harris raised more than $100 million. Why do you think there has been so much energy around a new potential Democratic candidate??\n\nA lot of the initial energy stems from the reason President Biden decided not to run for re-election. This is something that will be analyzed for years if not decades. What kind of pressure led to President Biden stepping down? It seemed that this process wasn't driven by \"the people\" but was a strange conversation between the media and certain elite groups. When you talk to actual voters, many feel that something odd was happening here. After President Biden stepped down from the top of the ticket, it naturally led to the question of who should take his place. This sparked swift and significant momentum within the Black community. Within hours of President Biden's tweet announcing his decision, 44,000 Black women, including myself, joined a Zoom call and raised over $1 million in just three or four hours, all focused on the idea of Vice President Harris leading the Democratic ticket. The following day, thousands of Black men also gathered on a Zoom call and raised another million dollars. These were regular people who felt that something was amiss and took action.\n\nPart of the reason the energy is moving so quickly is that, for the first time, we are truly hearing what the Black community thinks. Look back to President Biden's bid for the nomination in 2020: he lost state after state until he reached South Carolina, where there was a larger Black population. He won decisively there, and his entire trajectory changed. Every pundit said there was no hope until that point.\n\nWhen discussions arose about President Biden stepping down, there were also murmurs about rewriting the entire ticket. I believe that a significant reason behind the support for Vice President Harris is the recognition that this process needed to reflect the people's interests. She's got a number of years of experience, and a lot of these factors are leading to a lot of this support.\n\nQ: How does Harris\u2019s current presidential campaign differ from her campaign in 2020?\n\nI think the person we have today before us, Vice President Harris, the candidate today, is different than Senator Harris, the candidate of yesteryear. The last time she ran for president, she was a U.S. senator from California with extensive experiences as the state\u2019s attorney general and a prosecutor. She had significant accomplishments for her state. Now, she has traveled to almost as many countries as President Biden, participated in numerous decision-making meetings with him, has been at the helm of various legislative initiatives, and has cast deciding votes in the Senate as the Vice President of the United States. She has engaged in policy discussions with the president and has been a vocal advocate in those crucial spaces. This is someone who understands how the inner workings of what it takes to be President of the United States.\n\nQ: If Harris receives the Democratic nomination, what \u201cfirsts\u201d would she be as a major party candidate?\n\nThere are several. At a minimum, she would be:\n\nFirst Black woman\n\nFirst East Indian American person\n\nFirst Southeast Asian person\n\nFirst Historically Black College or University graduate\n\nCongresswoman Shirley Chisholm, the first Black woman to run for US President in 1972, passed away in 2005. Before she died, she shared her belief that within the next ten to twenty-five years, there would be a woman president. She predicted that this woman would likely serve as Vice President first. Secretary Hillary Clinton was the Democratic nominee in 2016, and Vice President Kamala Harris is a likely nominee for 2024. We are witnessing Chisholm's prediction unfold before our eyes.\n\nQ: What campaign challenges will Harris face as a candidate representing many groups for the first time?\n\nI think she's addressing two things. First, to be the first in many of these positions. But more critically, to ensure she is not the last, right? She wants people to see that not only they but also their children and grandchildren can have these opportunities. This is about showing that no matter your cultural background or religious practices, your journey is part of the American story, and you too can be part of its success and well-being.\n\nThere's a reason she can talk about recipes familiar in both the United States and India and navigate comfortably in various collegiate and cultural settings. Her story is part of the American story. She\u2019ll focus on the message: \u201cI may not share your lived experience, but my role as president is to ensure you reach the goals you have for your family.\u201d The conversation will shift from her being the first to emphasizing that because she's in this space, she can help elevate others' paths and prospects in this country.\n\nQ: If Harris receives the Democratic nomination, she will be the second woman to ever be nominated as a presidential candidate by a major U.S. political party. What campaign challenges does that present and what should voters watch for?\n\nSo many women in the United States and probably around the world have experienced the feeling that there is always something wrong with simply being themselves. You can stand in one place, and someone will say she's too tall, while another will say she's too short. One person will say she's too fat, and another will say she's too skinny. Some will say she's not smiling enough, and others will say she's smiling too much. All you can respond with is, \u201cI haven't moved an inch. How can I be wrong in every single aspect of simply being me?\u201d\n\nWhat we're going to really watch happen is that there can be serious concerns about policy issues, but it's going to often be coupled and tied into her lived experience as a Black East Indian American woman in the United States who grew up in California and has stepchildren. We're going to see people attempting to link her policy ideas to her identity, which is already devolving into terrible statements about her intelligence and fitness to serve. It's crucial for everyone to be intentional about calling out these instances of anti-Blackness and anti-woman rhetoric as they occur, stopping them immediately every single time.\n\nQ: We haven\u2019t had someone begin a major party Presidential campaign this late into the election season before. What challenges will Harris face making a bid for the Democratic nomination and the presidency this late into the election year?\n\nThere will always be the complexity of how we introduce candidates to the American people. There are historical plans. There have long been rule books and the method of how one runs for president. Candidates are expected to attend a certain number of events in specific states at particular times of the year to be seen and heard. Small town meetings, house events, gatherings in particular spaces. There's not enough time to do those things.\n\nWe\u2019re not going to have the time to do some of those traditional campaign activities. Right now, there\u2019s a lot of groundwork and coalition-building that needs to happen. Now they will shift quickly from \u201cCan this person motivate some?\u201d to \u201cCan these newly motivated people encourage others to go to the polls?\u201d Though the election is in November, early voting starts weeks in advance. It's almost time for people to start casting their ballots.\n\n. All of those things are going to have to happen right away. However, we are dealing with a skilled former prosecutor. This is an individual who not only got pretty complex legal training but has also learned what it means to be in a courtroom, to have to very succinctly explain their position to a jury of twelve people in the community, from all different types of backgrounds, to get a point across. Someone who is accustomed to working with judges understands the need to quickly change the conversation or present different points of evidence as required. They are always prepared to present their position, no matter the circumstances. This person has experience collaborating with opposing counsel to reach goals and make decisions. That is just in addition to all the other kinds of skills she's developed. She\u2019s already trained on how to pivot, how to explain her point, and how to do that in a time-restricted manner.\n\nQ: What else should voters keep in mind or anticipate as the presidential campaigns and election season continue to unfold?\n\nOne crucial aspect for people to consider is identifying where the Biden administration ends and where a Harris administration would begin. This distinction will be significant. We\u2019ve already seen an example when she made a statement about the Israel-Palestine situation, showcasing a different stance from President Biden. So, she's starting to highlight these distinctions, indicating where she might have made different policy decisions and taken different approaches.\n\nAnother element to consider is reviewing her work experience. What were her accomplishments as a prosecutor, attorney general, senator, and vice president? She needs to highlight specific examples that demonstrate her thinking and how she will act for the people. Her campaign will be working diligently on this in the next two or three weeks. Additionally, we will learn a lot once her vice-presidential nominee is selected. This choice will indicate which parts of the country are in play, and which are not. We'll also need to watch for changes in polls and who gets contacted for them Even more critically, we must consider the impact that new voting restrictions across the country might have on voter turnout in the election.\n\nQ: How will New Mexico be impacted by this election?\n\nFor us in New Mexico, we're going to be watching the entire election very carefully because of how closely tied we are to the federal government. Many aspects of New Mexico help fuel the federal government and vice versa. Whatever happens in D.C. will directly impact New Mexico, making this a very important election. You can expect to see the candidates making their way here this coming fall.\n\nLearn more about issues impacting the 2024 election directly from UNM faculty experts on elections.unm.edu.",

Among likely voters, Harris is the choice of 50% and Trump the choice of 49%. These results include initially undecided voters who were then asked whom they would vote for if they had to choose.\n\nIn June, before the debate between President Joe Biden and Trump and with Biden as the Democratic candidate, Biden and Trump each received 50% among Wisconsin registered voters, while Biden received 51% and Trump 49% among likely voters.\n\nIn a multicandidate race, Harris, a Democrat, is the choice of 45% and Trump, a Republican, 43%. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. receives 8%, Libertarian Chase Oliver 1%, Green Party candidate Jill Stein 1%, Constitution Party candidate Randall Terry <0.5%, and independent Cornel West <0.5%, among registered voters. Among likely voters, it is Harris 46%, Trump 45%, Kennedy 6%, Oliver 1%, Stein 1%, Terry <0.5%, and West <0.5%.\n\nIn the U.S. Senate race, Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin is supported by 53% to Republican Eric Hovde\u2019s 46% among registered voters. Among likely voters, Baldwin receives 52% and Hovde receives 47%. These results include initially undecided voters who were then asked whom they would vote for if they had to choose. On the initial question, before that \u201cif you had to choose\u201d follow-up, Baldwin receives 47%, Hovde 39%, and 14% say they are undecided, among registered voters.\n\nWhen the Senate ballot includes independent candidates, Baldwin receives 50%, Hovde receives 44%, Phil Anderson (the \u201cDisrupt the Corruption\u201d party candidate) receives 2% and Thomas Leager, of the \u201cAmerica First\u201d party, receives 2%, among registered voters. Among likely voters, Baldwin receives 51% and Hovde 45%, with 2% each for Anderson and Leager.\n\nThe survey was conducted July 24-Aug. 1, 2024, interviewing 877 Wisconsin registered voters, with a margin of error of +/-4.6 percentage points. The poll included 801 likely voters, with a margin of error of +/-4.8 percentage points. (All results are stated as percentages.)\n\nWhile the race for president remains very close in Wisconsin, when asked who they think is likely to win in November, 51% say Trump will definitely or probably win, while 39% say Harris will definitely or probably win and 11% say they don\u2019t know.\n\nThe perceived chances of Biden winning, had he stayed in the race, are lower than the perceived chances with Harris as the candidate. Asked about the winner between Biden and Trump, 20% say Biden would definitely or probably win, while 69% say Trump would win.\n\nA substantial majority (79%) say Biden should have withdrawn from the race, while 15% say he should have continued as the Democratic nominee. Among Democrats, 91% say Biden should have withdrawn.\n\nAsked whom they would have voted for if Biden remained in the race, 42% say Biden, 47% say Trump, and 10% say they don\u2019t know.\n\nA majority (58%) say Biden should not resign but should serve out his term as president, while 33% say he should resign and 9% say they don\u2019t know.\n\nDemocrats are overwhelmingly satisfied with Harris as the nominee, with 92% very or somewhat satisfied with her as the nominee and 7% very or somewhat dissatisfied.\n\nThe poll was completed before she secured the nomination through a virtual roll call of delegates on Aug. 2. A majority (54%) of Democrats think the party should settle on a nominee before the convention, while almost a third (32%) say there should be an open convention and 13% don\u2019t know.\n\nFavorability to candidates\n\nHarris is seen in this survey favorably by 41% and unfavorably by 53% of registered voters, with 6% saying they don\u2019t know enough about her to have an opinion. When this question was last asked about Harris in June 2022, 36% had a favorable opinion and 49% had an unfavorable view, with 15% who did not have an opinion of her.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz was chosen as the Democratic nominee for vice president after the poll was completed.\n\nIn this survey, following the July 13 assassination attempt against Trump and the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee July 15-18, favorability toward Trump in Wisconsin rose to 44%, with 54% unfavorable and 2% without an opinion. In June, his favorability was 41%, with 57% unfavorable and 2% lacking an opinion.\n\nFavorability toward Biden was unchanged from June, following his withdrawal from the presidential race, remaining at 40% favorable, while his unfavorable rating declined one percentage point to 57%.\n\nThose with unfavorable opinions of both candidates\u2014the so-called \u201cdouble haters\u201d\u2014declined slightly in July. For Biden and Trump, 17% were unfavorable to both in June. That group declined to 14% in July. For Harris and Trump, 11% have an unfavorable view of both in July.\n\nRepublican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance is seen favorably by 31% and unfavorably by 41%, with 29% saying they haven\u2019t heard enough or don\u2019t know. Vance is seen much more favorably by Republicans, but is viewed unfavorably by independents and especially Democrats, as shown in Table 1. Substantial percentages of each partisan group, and especially independents, say they have not yet formed an opinion of Vance.\n\nTable 1: Vance favorability, by party identification\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nParty ID Favorability Favorable Unfavorable Haven't heard enough Don't know Republican 63 8 28 1 Independent 13 31 55 0 Democrat 1 78 20 1 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin survey, July 24-Aug. 1, 2024 Question: Do you have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of [name] or haven't you heard enough about them yet?\n\nVance is seen as an excellent pick for the vice-presidential slot by 17%, as a good choice by 25%, as a fair choice by 10%, and as a poor selection by 35%, with 14% who say they don\u2019t know. More than three-quarters of Republicans rate the choice of Vance as excellent or good, while independents are more divided and more than two-thirds of Democrats rate it poor, as shown in Table 2.\n\nTable 2: Vance as VP, by party identification\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nParty ID Rate choice of Vance as VP Excellent Good Fair Poor Don't know Republican 32 45 7 8 8 Independent 8 23 23 17 28 Democrat 3 4 9 68 16 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin survey, July 24-Aug. 1, 2024 Question: How would you rate Trump\u2019s choice of Vance for vice president? Would you rate this choice as excellent, good, fair, or poor?\n\nEnthusiasm and likelihood of voting\n\nEnthusiasm about voting in November increased sharply from June to July, as shown in Table 4. In the current survey, 61% say they are very enthusiastic about voting, a substantial increase from 46% in June. This was the first substantial movement in enthusiasm in 2024, with fewer than 50% in all prior Marquette Law School Poll surveys of Wisconsin voters in 2024 saying they were very enthusiastic. For comparison, in the previous presidential cycle in early August 2020, 62% were very enthusiastic, basically the same level as now matched for the first time in 2024, but such enthusiasm was also seen in earlier Marquette Law School Poll surveys in 2020, unlike this year.\n\nTable 4: Enthusiasm to vote in November election\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nPoll dates Enthusiasm Very Somewhat Not too Not at all 7/24-8/1/24 61 21 15 4 6/12-20/24 46 21 19 14 4/3-10/24 47 22 18 12 1/24-31/24 49 25 17 9 10/26-11/2/23 46 28 19 6 8/4-9/20 62 20 8 9 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin survey, latest: July 24-Aug. 1, 2024 Question: (2024) How enthusiastic are you about voting in the elections in November 2024 for president and other offices? Would you say you are very, somewhat, not too, or not at all enthusiastic? Question: (2020) How enthusiastic are you about voting in this November\u2019s elections? Would you say you are very, somewhat, not too, or not at all enthusiastic?\n\nEnthusiasm has increased primarily among Democrats and, to a lesser degree, among independents and Republicans. Republicans had a substantial enthusiasm advantage over Democrats in previous polls in 2024, but that has been mostly erased now, as shown in Table 5.\n\nTable 5: Enthusiasm to vote in November election, by party identification\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nPoll dates Enthusiasm Very Somewhat Not too Not at all Democrat 7/24-8/1/24 62 19 15 4 6/12-20/24 40 24 20 16 Independent 7/24-8/1/24 37 20 26 17 6/12-20/24 30 17 23 29 Republican 7/24-8/1/24 64 22 12 1 6/12-20/24 57 19 16 8 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin survey, latest: July 24-Aug. 1, 2024 Question: (2024) How enthusiastic are you about voting in the elections in November 2024 for president and other offices? Would you say you are very, somewhat, not too, or not at all enthusiastic?\n\nThose who are very enthusiastic give Trump a slight edge over Harris, while those somewhat enthusiastic give Harris an even slighter edge. Those who are not too enthusiastic and those not at all enthusiastic give Harris larger margins, as shown in Table 6.\n\nTable 6: Vote for Harris or Trump, by enthusiasm\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nEnthusiasm Vote choice 2024 Kamala Harris Donald Trump Haven't decided Refused Very enthusiastic 47 52 0 0 Somewhat enthusiastic 50 49 2 0 Not too enthusiastic 55 43 2 0 Not at all enthusiastic 60 36 4 0 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin survey, July 24-Aug. 1, 2024 Question: If the 2024 election for president were held today between Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democrat, and Former President Donald Trump, the Republican, would you vote for Kamala Harris or for Donald Trump or haven\u2019t you decided? Question: If you had to choose, would you vote for Harris or for Trump? Question: How enthusiastic are you about voting in the elections in November 2024 for president and other offices? Would you say you are very, somewhat, not too, or not at all enthusiastic?\n\nIn June, with Biden as the Democratic candidate, this enthusiasm gap was much more pronounced, as shown in Table 7. At that time, Trump held a larger margin with the very enthusiastic than he now holds over Harris among that group, and Biden had larger margins over Trump with all other enthusiasm groups than Harris now holds.\n\nTable 7: Vote for Biden or Trump, by enthusiasm, June 2024\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nEnthusiasm Vote choice 2024 Joe Biden Donald Trump Haven't decided/Neither Very enthusiastic 39 61 0 Somewhat enthusiastic 57 43 0 Not too enthusiastic 58 41 1 Not at all enthusiastic 65 33 1 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin survey, June 12-20, 2024 Question: If the 2024 election for president were held today between President Joe Biden, the Democrat, and Former President Donald Trump, the Republican, would you vote for Joe Biden or for Donald Trump or haven\u2019t you decided? Question: If you had to choose, would you vote for Biden or for Trump? Question: How enthusiastic are you about voting in the elections in November 2024 for president and other offices? Would you say you are very, somewhat, not too, or not at all enthusiastic?\n\nCharacteristics of Harris, Trump, and Biden\n\nThe replacement of Biden by Harris has changed the relative perceptions of the candidates, with Harris having different perceived traits from Biden. Table 8 shows which phrases describe Harris, Trump, and Biden. The Biden numbers are from the June poll while Harris and Trump perceptions are from July, the new survey.\n\nTable 8: How well does this phrase describe Harris or Trump or Biden\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nCandidate How well phrase describes Very/somewhat well Not too/not at all well Is too old to be president Harris 12 87 Trump 59 40 Biden 76 24 Shares your values Harris 51 49 Trump 46 54 Biden 43 57 Has behaved corruptly Harris 37 62 Trump 62 37 Biden 46 53 Strong record of accomplishments Harris 44 55 Trump 54 46 Biden 43 57 Has the right temperament to be president Harris 56 43 Trump 42 58 Biden 52 48 Is a strong leader Harris 50 50 Trump 58 42 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin survey, July 24-Aug. 1, 2024 (Note: Biden items asked in June. Strong leader was not asked in June.) Question: How well does each of the following phrases describe (Kamala Harris)(Donald Trump)(Joe Biden)?\n\nRespondents were also asked if Harris and Trump have the communication skills to succeed as president. For Harris, 52% say she does have the skills needed and 39% say she does not, while 9% say they don\u2019t know. For Trump, 49% say he has the communication skills to succeed as president, while 49% say he does not and 1% say they don\u2019t know. This has not been asked about Biden.\n\nWith respect to his New York criminal trial in May, 52% say Trump was guilty as the jury found, while 36% say he is not guilty and the jury made the wrong ruling. Eleven percent don\u2019t know.\n\nTrump is scheduled to be sentenced in September. In July, 28% say he should be given no penalty at all, 11% say a fine only, 11% say probation without jail, 38% say he should be sentenced to jail, and 12% don\u2019t know.\n\nIssues in the presidential campaign\n\nTable 9 shows which candidate it is thought would do a better job on each of eight issues. Trump is seen as better on immigration and border security, the Israel-Hamas war, and the economy, and holds a slight edge on handling foreign relations. Harris is seen as better on abortion policy, health care, ensuring fair and accurate elections, and on Medicare and Social Security.\n\nBetween 8% and 20% say both candidates would be about the same or that neither would be good on each issue.\n\nTable 9: Which candidate would do a better job on issues\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nIssue Who better Harris Trump Both about the same Neither good Immigration and border security 36 52 6 5 Israel-Hamas war 33 47 7 13 The economy 39 51 6 3 Foreign relations 44 47 4 4 Medicare & Social Security 48 39 9 4 Ensuring fair and accurate elections 47 36 9 7 Health care 49 36 10 5 Abortion policy 53 34 6 6 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin survey, July 24-Aug. 1, 2024 Question: Do you think Kamala Harris or Donald Trump would do a better job handling each of the following issues, they are both about the same or would neither be good on the issue?\n\nMost important issues\n\nRespondents were asked which of the eight issues would be most important for deciding their vote. The economy is the top-rated issue, followed by abortion policy, and immigration, with Medicare and Social Security as fourth most important, as shown in Table 10.\n\nTable 10: Most important issue\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nMost important issue Response Percent The economy 38 Abortion policy 14 Immigration and border security 13 Medicare & Social Security 9 Health care 7 Ensuring fair and accurate elections 6 The war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza 3 Foreign relations 2 Don't know 7 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin survey, July 24-Aug. 1, 2024 Question: Which one of the following issues will be MOST important in deciding your vote for president?\n\nPartisans differ on the most important issues, as shown in Table 11. Republicans are much more likely to rank the economy and immigration as most important, while placing little weight on any of the other issues. Independents rank the economy as most important with no other issue reaching double digits. Democrats put abortion policy as their top concern, followed by Medicare and Social Security with the economy third. Only 1% of Democrats rank immigration as their top issue concern, as do 7% of independents.\n\nTable 11: Most important issue, by party identification\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nParty ID Issue The economy Immigration and border security Health care Foreign relations Abortion policy Medicare & Social Security The war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza Ensuring fair and accurate elections Don't know Republican 55 26 2 2 5 2 0 3 5 Independent 45 7 9 3 7 7 6 2 14 Democrat 17 1 13 1 26 18 5 11 8 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin survey, July 24-Aug. 1, 2024 Question: Which one of the following issues will be MOST important in deciding your vote for president?\n\nSupport for deporting immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally varies depending on the framing of the issue. A random half-sample of the survey was asked:\n\nDo you favor or oppose deporting immigrants who are living in the United States illegally back to their home countries?\n\nWith this wording, 64% favor deportation and 34% are opposed, with 2% who say they don\u2019t know.\n\nThe other half-sample was asked:\n\nDo you favor or oppose deporting immigrants who are living in the United States illegally back to their home countries even if they have lived here for a number of years, have jobs, and no criminal record?\n\nWhen worded this way, 44% favor deportations and 55% are opposed, with a half-percent who don\u2019t know.\n\nTwo-thirds of registered voters say abortion should be legal in all or most cases. and one third say it should be illegal in all or most cases. This has changed little since Roe v. Wade was overturned in June 2022. The full trend is shown in Table 12.\n\nTable 12: Abortion opinion trend\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nPoll dates Opinion Legal in all cases Legal in most cases Illegal in most cases Illegal in all cases Don't know 7/24-8/1/24 33 34 27 5 1 6/12-20/24 34 32 26 8 0 4/3-10/24 28 36 26 9 1 6/8-13/23 32 34 25 6 1 8/10-15/22 30 35 25 5 3 6/14-20/22 27 31 24 11 5 10/26-31/21 23 38 23 11 4 2/19-23/20 18 37 22 15 6 10/24-28/18 26 29 24 14 4 9/12-16/18 26 36 21 9 6 7/11-15/18 27 36 18 11 6 10/23-26/14 24 34 24 15 3 10/21-24/13 26 36 25 10 2 10/25-28/12 28 32 23 12 4 10/11-14/12 25 34 25 12 3 9/27-30/12 25 35 23 12 3 9/13-16/12 26 34 23 13 3 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin survey, latest: July 24-Aug. 1, 2024 Question: Do you think abortion should be legal in all cases, legal in most cases, illegal in most cases, or illegal in all cases?\n\nMulticandidate vote trends\n\nThe trend in vote preference including independent and third-party candidates is shown in Table 13. Oliver was not included prior to the June poll and Terry appears for the first time in July. The total third-party vote has declined in the poll\u2019s surveys, from 22% in January to 10% now, with Kennedy falling from 16% to 8% over that time among registered voters.\n\nTable 13: Vote including third-party candidates\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nPoll dates Vote choice Biden/Harris Trump Kennedy Oliver Stein Terry West Don't know Registered voters 7/24-8/1/24 45 43 8 1 1 <.5 <.5 0 6/12-20/24 40 43 8 2 2 n/a 4 1 4/3-10/24 40 41 13 n/a 3 n/a 2 1 1/24-31/24 37 40 16 n/a 4 n/a 2 1 Likely voters 7/24-8/1/24 46 45 6 1 1 <.5 <.5 0 6/12-20/24 42 44 7 1 2 n/a 3 1 4/3-10/24 41 42 12 n/a 3 n/a 1 1 1/24-31/24 39 41 13 n/a 4 n/a 2 1 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin survey, latest: July 24-Aug. 1, 2024 Question: If the presidential ballot included additional candidates, would you vote for Democrat Kamala Harris, Republican Donald Trump, independent Robert F.

        "text": "Get ready to vote in 2024 presidential election\nFor most students on the University of South Carolina campus this fall, 2024 is your first chance to vote in a presidential election. To help with this exciting milestone, here are some resources that can help you get registered on time (if you\u2019re not already registered) and make sure your vote is counted even if you are many states away from home.\n\nAs a student, you have a right to register to vote where you live, whether that is your family\u2019s home or where you attend school. You should update your registration when your address changes. And remember, you may be registered and vote in only one location.\n\nUSC partners with TurboVote, which is a platform that gives you an easy-to-use space to register to vote, check your registration and connect with additional voting resources and information. TurboVote is free for students to use and can be your one-stop shop to prepare for the election.\n\nUSC has also partnered with our home county to provide early voting at the Blatt P.E. Center from Oct. 21 to Nov. 1 for students, faculty and staff who are registered to vote in Richland County, South Carolina.\n\nCheck out the Leadership and Service Center civic engagement webpage for more resources on the rules of where you can vote and what documents you need to get registered. You can also learn about events, such as the Dialogue Series, which can help you navigate difficult conversations and turn them into valuable learning experiences. The first Dialogue Series event will be Sept. 17, which is also National Voter Registration Day.\n\nThe Southeastern Conference student governments are partnering to challenge 20,000 students across the SEC to register to vote. The initiative will kick off in September and is being led by USC Student Government President Patton Byars.\n\nIt's never too early to make your voting plan. Use Vote411\u2019s voting plan to help you prepare.\n\nRemember: There are no classes on Election Day (Nov. 5) so there are no excuses for not voting.\n\nVoter checklist:\n\nRegister or verify a valid prior registration.\n\nLearn your voting options and locations.\n\nResearch candidates.\n\nPlan transportation.\n\nVote!\n\nThe registration deadline was exteded to Oct. 14 (because of Hurricane Helene) for all eligible South Carolina residents whether you choose to register in person, online, or by mail.\n\n\n\nIf you are planning to vote in another state, you may need to prepare further in advance. Each state has different election laws and deadlines. For more information about your state\u2019s voting laws and procedures, go to Vote411 and select your state.\n\nKeep up with absentee ballot deadlines by entering your address on TurboVote.\n\nMore resources",

This isn't a Democrat or Republican issue, it's an American and Virginian issue. Every legal vote deserves to be counted without being watered down by illegal votes or inaccurate machines. In Virginia, we don\u2019t play games and our model for election security is working,\u201d said Governor Glenn Youngkin.\n\n\u201cWe use 100% paper ballots with a strict chain of custody. We use counting machines, not voting machines, that are tested prior to every election and never connected to the internet. We do not mass mail ballots. We monitor our drop boxes 24/7. We verify the legal presence and identity of voters using DMV data and other trusted data sources to update our voter rolls daily, not only adding new voters, but scrubbing the lists to remove those that should not be on it, like the deceased, individuals that have moved, and non-citizens that have accidentally or maliciously attempted to register,\u201d Governor Glenn Youngkin continued.\n\nThe EO codifies improvements to election security made during the Governor\u2019s administration by directing the Commissioner of the Department of Elections to certify in writing annually that these improvements are in place. The EO also outlines the procedures in place for non-citizens who attempt to violate the law and register to vote, which includes referral to the local Commonwealth\u2019s attorney and the Office of Attorney General, which has concurrent jurisdiction.\n\n# # #",

        "text": "The Legion's policy during election cycles\nAs the 2024 presidential election nears, it is imperative for American Legion members and posts to remember that The American Legion is a nonpolitical, nonpartisan organization that will not be used for the dissemination of partisan principles nor for the promotion of any candidate or party. This includes the wearing of American Legion and Sons of The American Legion apparel when engaged in partisan activities.\n\nAs Legionnaires will cast their ballots on Election Day, The American Legion advocates for all U.S. citizens to register and vote in all elections through its \u201cGet Out the Vote\u201d program. Download the \u201cVote, America\u201d brochure to see how your post can encourage more Americans to vote.\n\nLegion posts, Legionnaires and SAL members should follow these dos and don\u2019ts during an election cycle:\n\n1. Can I wear my American Legion cap to a political event or when promoting my political views in media? No. The American Legion cap is considered the official Legion uniform (see p. 3 of the 2024 Officer's Guide). If attending a political event, The American Legion cap, or any clothing with The American Legion emblem visible, must be removed so as not to imply any endorsement by The American Legion.\n\n2. Can we use our American Legion post for a political event? When using post facilities to host any candidates, the post must remove American Legion emblems and American Legion flags to avoid any impression of endorsements. Candidates for all parties must be presented equal opportunity to use the facilities on the same terms and conditions as other competing candidates.\n\n3. Can I get The American Legion at the local, state and national level to support a candidate running for Congress or any political office? No. In Article II, Section 2, of the Constitution of The American Legion, \"The American Legion shall be absolutely nonpolitical and shall not be used for the dissemination of partisan principles nor for the promotion of the candidacy of any person seeking public office or preferment.\" Additionally, the National Charter, approved by Congress, stipulates The American Legion as an organization is nonpolitical. Therefore, The American Legion as an organization is never to help or endorse a candidate. However, you, as a private citizen and not speaking for the organization, can do whatever is legal and ethical to advance his/her candidacy.\n\n4. Can our post host a registration or voting drive to support \u201cGet Out the Vote\u201d? Yes. Just remember that volunteers working on an American Legion-sponsored registration and voting drive should not wear campaign buttons or make their personal views about candidates, parties and issues known in any way while they are engaged in nonpartisan activities for their post. Any campaign materials or literature should be removed from areas where nonpartisan activities are taking place.",

Sign up for The World This Week.\n\nIntroduction\n\nImmigration has been a touchstone of the U.S. political debate for decades, as policymakers have weighed economic, security, and humanitarian concerns. However, Congress has continued to disagree on comprehensive immigration reform, effectively moving some major policy decisions into the executive and judicial branches of government and fueling debate in the halls of state and municipal governments.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has put efforts to reshape asylum, border, and deportation policy at the center of his political movement. President Joe Biden had pledged to reverse Trump\u2019s first-term actions and reform the system, but the end of pandemic-related border restrictions and a historic surge in migration have complicated his plans.\n\nWhat is the immigrant population in the United States?\n\nImmigrants composed an estimated 13.9 percent of the U.S. population in 2022, amounting to roughly 46 million people out of a total of almost 335 million, according to U.S. Census Bureau data released in April 2024. Together, immigrants and their U.S.-born children made up about 27 percent of U.S. inhabitants, per the Current Population Survey. Though the share of the population that is foreign born has steadily risen since 1970, when there were fewer than ten million immigrants in the country, recent figures still fall below the record high of 14.8 percent in 1890.\n\nAs of 2022, Mexico was the top country of origin for U.S. immigrants, with Mexicans constituting 23 percent of the total immigrant population. Other major countries of origin include India (6 percent); China, including Hong Kong and Macau (5 percent); and the Philippines (4 percent).\n\nUndocumented immigration. The U.S. government estimated the undocumented population to be some eleven million people in 2022. This total represents a slight decrease from 11.8 million before the 2008 economic crisis [PDF], which led some immigrants to return to their home countries and discouraged others from coming to the United States. In fiscal year 2023 (FY 2023), Customs and Border Protection (CBP) apprehended nearly 2.5 million people trying to illegally cross the southern U.S. border, a record high.\n\nUntil 2013, almost all of those trying to cross the U.S.-Mexico border were Mexican citizens, and most were individuals seeking work. Between 2013 and 2021, most immigrants came from Asia, particularly China and India. Mexico has since regained its status as the top country of origin, and Central Americans have made up an increasingly larger share of migrants at the southern U.S. border. Generally, they are coming not for work but to make asylum claims, and many of them are unaccompanied children. Some of these immigrants have different legal rights from Mexican nationals in the United States: Under a 2008 anti\u2013human trafficking law, unaccompanied minors from noncontiguous countries have a right to a hearing before being deported to their home countries. The increase in Central American migration has strained the U.S. immigration system. At the end of FY 2023, there were nearly 2.8 million cases pending in immigration courts, the most on record.\n\nThough many of the policies that aim to reduce unlawful immigration focus on enforcement at the border, individuals who arrive in the United States legally and overstay their visas comprise a significant portion of the undocumented population. A Center for Migration Studies report found that, between 2010 and 2018, individuals who overstayed their visas far outnumbered those who arrived by crossing the border illegally.\n\nLegal immigration. The United States granted more than one million individuals [PDF] legal permanent residency in FY 2022, close to pre-pandemic levels. Some 58 percent of them were admitted on the basis of family reunification. Other categories included: employment-based preferences (27 percent), refugees (3 percent), diversity (4 percent), and asylees (5 percent). As of late 2023, more than four million applicants were on the State Department\u2019s waiting list [PDF] for family- and employer-related immigrant visas, nearly a third of whom were from Mexico.\n\nHundreds of thousands of foreign nationals work legally in the United States under various types of nonimmigrant visas. In FY 2023, the United States granted more than 265,000 visas for high-skilled workers [PDF], known as H1B visas, and over 310,000 visas for temporary workers in agriculture and other industries, or H2A visas. H1B visas are capped at 85,000 per fiscal year, with exceptions for certain fields.\n\nImmigrants made up 18.6 percent of the U.S. civilian workforce [PDF] in 2023, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, up from 18.1 percent the previous year. Compared to those born in the United States, greater shares of immigrants worked in service fields (21.8 percent of all foreign-born people); production, transportation, and material moving (15.2 percent); and natural resources, construction, and maintenance (13.8 percent).\n\nHow do Americans feel about immigration?\n\nA February 2024 poll by Gallup showed that 28 percent of surveyed Americans considered immigration to be the top problem facing the United States. In a separate Gallup poll conducted that same month, the majority of respondents felt that illegal immigration was a \u201ccritical\u201d threat to U.S. national security.\n\nA Pew Research Center poll conducted in April found that some 60 percent of the registered voters surveyed believed that undocumented immigrants currently in the United States should be allowed to stay, with 36 percent of respondents saying that undocumented immigrants should have the opportunity to apply for citizenship. In addition, a large majority of Americans still consider immigration to be overall good for the country.\n\nHow has Congress tried to address the issue?\n\nThe most recent push for an immigration policy overhaul was in 2013, following a decade in which Congress debated numerous immigration reforms, some considered comprehensive and others piecemeal. (Comprehensive immigration reform refers to omnibus legislation that attempts to address the following issues: demand for high- and low-skilled labor, the legal status of the millions of undocumented immigrants living in the country, border security, and interior enforcement.) The last major legislation to make it through Congress was under President Ronald Reagan in 1986, when his administration granted legal amnesty to some three million undocumented residents; in 1990, President George H.W. Bush further expanded legal immigration by increasing the cap for immigrant visas from 270,000 to 700,000, though he lowered the quota to 675,000 after several years. In 2007, President George W. Bush worked with congressional Democrats to reach a compromise on a new comprehensive bill, but it ultimately failed to win enough support in the Senate.\n\nPresident Barack Obama pressed hard for a comprehensive bill that would pair a path to legalization for undocumented residents with stronger border security provisions. The Democrat-led Senate passed this legislation in 2013, but the bill stalled in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. Both Presidents Trump and Biden put forward their own plans, which were not seriously considered by Congress.\n\nWhat was the Obama administration\u2019s approach?\n\nWith legislation thwarted, Obama focused on executive action, a tactic that his successors continued. In 2012, his administration began a program known as DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which offered renewable, two-year deportation deferrals and work permits to undocumented immigrants who had arrived in the United States as children and had no criminal records.\n\nObama characterized the move as a \u201cstopgap measure\u201d and urged Congress to pass the DREAM Act, or Development Relief and Education for Alien Minors\u2014legislation first introduced in 2001 that would have benefited many of the same people. Since then, more than 830,000 people have participated in DACA, and it\u2019s estimated that almost 1.2 million more were eligible as of 2023. Obama attempted to extend similar benefits to undocumented parents of U.S. citizens and permanent residents through a program known as Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (DAPA), but the Supreme Court effectively killed it in 2016.\n\nIn 2014, Obama also grappled with a surge of more than sixty thousand unaccompanied minors at the southern border, mostly from Central America. He directed $750 million in aid to the region to improve conditions there. Meanwhile, his administration faced criticism for its enforcement policies, including detaining children in poor conditions and overseeing the deportation of more people\u2014approximately three million\u2014than either the Bill Clinton or George W. Bush administrations had.\n\nWhat was the Trump administration\u2019s approach?\n\nImmigration remains a signature issue for Trump. He blames previous administrations for failing to secure the southern border, and in his first term, he advocated for sharply reducing both legal and illegal immigration. He repeatedly used executive action to reshape asylum, deportation, and border policy.\n\nBorder security and enforcement. Trump vowed to expand the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, which he claimed would stop drugs and gangs from entering the country. He was unsuccessful in securing funding from Congress, leading to a federal government shutdown in 2019 and a subsequent declaration of a national emergency, which allowed him to divert funds to build the wall.\n\nOther enforcement measures under Trump included increasing border personnel; sending thousands of active-duty troops to the border; threatening Mexico with tariffs if it did not increase its own border enforcement; and attempting to cut federal funding to so-called sanctuary cities, or jurisdictions that refuse to enforce federal immigration directives.\n\nTrump also ratcheted up previous administrations\u2019 deterrence efforts. He implemented a zero-tolerance policy, under which authorities arrested and prosecuted everyone caught crossing the southern border without authorization. This caused thousands of family separations, since by law children must be held apart from parents facing criminal prosecution. (Presidents Bush and Obama likewise faced criticism for child detention, but they did not make separations a matter of policy.)\n\nDACA. Trump sought to end DACA, calling it unconstitutional. The move spurred multiple legal challenges and, in June 2020, the Supreme Court blocked Trump\u2019s plan. A December 2020 federal court ruling forced the Trump administration to resume accepting new applicants.\n\nTravel bans and refugee cap. Trump aimed to sharply reduce the number of refugees and other immigrants granted legal entry into the United States. In 2017, he instituted a ban on immigration and travel from several Muslim-majority countries, including Iran, Somalia, and Yemen. The original order was rejected by the courts, but the Supreme Court upheld a more limited version. Trump also lowered the cap on the number of refugees the United States accepts each year to less than fifteen thousand for FY 2021\u2014the lowest figure in the history of the U.S. refugee program. Additionally, he ended temporary protected status (TPS)\u2014a program that allows migrants from certain crisis-stricken nations to live and work in the United States for a limited period\u2014for several countries.\n\nAsylum policy. Trump implemented new restrictions on asylum seekers. In 2018, the administration began \u201cmetering\u201d asylum applications, or only accepting a limited number [PDF] each day. The next year, it launched the Migrant Protection Protocols, also known as the \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d program, which required asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while their cases were processed in U.S. courts. At the same time, it sought \u201csafe third country\u201d agreements with several Latin American countries, which would have allowed U.S. authorities to send asylum seekers who traveled through those countries back there. Only an agreement with Guatemala was implemented before that country terminated it in 2021. Additionally, the Trump administration invoked Title 42, previously a rarely used public health law, to deny asylum on health-related grounds amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nComprehensive reform effort. Like his immediate predecessors, Trump proposed broad immigration reform. His would have created a merit-based system to replace the current one, which prioritizes family reunification. It also included an expansion of the border wall and an employment verification system known as E-Verify, but it did not address the status of current undocumented residents. Congress ultimately did not take up the proposal.\n\nWhat has been Biden\u2019s approach?\n\nAhead of the 2020 presidential election, Biden campaigned on overturning almost all of Trump\u2019s immigration policies. Since then, the Biden administration has reduced immigration enforcement within the United States, ended the travel bans, expanded green-card access for certain undocumented immigrants, and ended the controversial Title 42 policy, though it did initially maintain many pandemic-related restrictions. The administration also initially halted construction of the U.S.-Mexico border wall, though it has since moved forward with plans to build additional sections; expanded TPS protections; terminated the Remain in Mexico program (with Supreme Court approval); and raised the refugee cap to 125,000 for fiscal years 2022\u201324.\n\nHowever, Biden\u2019s efforts to undo Trump-era policies have been challenged by a historic influx of migrants at the southern border. The record surge in border crossings has prompted the administration to implement several new restrictions since 2023, including a so-called transit ban allowing the government to deny asylum to migrants who did not previously apply for protection in a third country. In addition, the administration can temporarily bar asylum requests when the number of illegal crossings exceeds a certain threshold; since the start of 2024, illegal crossings have slowed.\n\nMeanwhile, Biden has worked with Latin American leaders to increase aid to refugee populations, improve border management, and better coordinate emergency responses, even as his own comprehensive immigration reform bill and other border security legislation have failed in Congress. His administration has also launched efforts to accelerate the reunification of migrant families, including by reinstating the Central American Minors (CAM) program, which reunites children in the so-called Northern Triangle countries with their parents in the United States, and by creating a family-reunification task force. Additionally, Biden has pledged to invest $4 billion to address the drivers of migration from Central America, and he has sought to revive DACA; the Department of Homeland Security continues to accept and process renewal requests amid ongoing legal challenges to the program.\n\nDaily News Brief A summary of global news developments with CFR analysis delivered to your inbox each morning.

Some, including California and Massachusetts, allow undocumented immigrants to apply for drivers\u2019 licenses, receive in-state tuition at universities, and obtain other benefits. At the other end of the spectrum are states such as Texas, where the legislature passed a law [PDF] mandating that local governments and law enforcement agencies cooperate with federal immigration officers.\n\nThe federal government is generally responsible for enforcing immigration laws, but it delegates some immigration-related duties to state and local law enforcement. However, the degree to which local officials are obliged to cooperate with federal authorities is a subject of intense debate: dozens of counties across thirteen states are home to so-called sanctuary cities that limit cooperation with immigration enforcement.\n\nThe degree to which local officials are obliged to cooperate with federal authorities is a subject of intense debate.\n\nPresident Trump decried these sanctuary jurisdictions and reinstated a controversial Obama-era program known as Secure Communities, in which the FBI shares fingerprints of suspects collected by state and local law enforcement with federal immigration authorities. Under the program, state and local agencies also hand over individuals presumed to be in the country illegally. Biden terminated the program shortly after taking office.\n\nA range of court rulings during the Trump era increased pressure on states. In 2018, the Justice Department launched a lawsuit against California over sanctuary jurisdictions, which was ultimately dismissed by the Supreme Court. It filed similar suits against New Jersey and Washington, and a federal court ruled in 2020 that the Trump administration could withhold federal funding from sanctuary jurisdictions, including New York City. Under Biden, the Justice Department reversed this stance, leading the Supreme Court to dismiss several pending cases.\n\nThe ongoing border crisis has driven increasing controversy over local responses. After Trump called on states to deploy National Guard contingents to the southern border, several governors refused. Others, including Texas\u2019s Greg Abbott, embraced Trump\u2019s views, continuing to expand the border wall and seeking to boost the role of state and local law enforcement in carrying out federal immigration policy. In the Biden era, Abbott has sought to impose stronger enforcement at the Texas-Mexico border despite federal opposition. The governor signed a law in December 2023 making it a state crime to cross the border into Texas illegally and authorizing law enforcement to arrest and deport migrants. The bill remains on hold amid legal challenges; several other states are attempting to enact similar legislation.",

It\u2019s about two old white men liking our Social Security, liking our Medicare, liking our freedom, liking our democracy \u2014 we\u2019ll lose it if Trump gets elected.\u201d\n\nHe also told The Independent that his son, a US Marine, had served a pair of tours at the base that was struck by Iran-backed militants in Iraq yesterday.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s no loser and he\u2019s no sucker for serving in the United States\u2019s service, and Trump\u2019s not going to call my son a loser or a sucker. Not today, not tomorrow, not ever,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nStrain added that he \u201cfeels\u201d Biden, citing the death of the president\u2019s eldest son, Beau Biden, following a tour of duty in Iraq.\n\n\u201cJoe\u2019s my guy, but we got to win this. He did the best thing he could do. He saved us for four years, and it\u2019s time for a new torch to be passed to a new generation,\u201d he said.\n\nThe debut outing for the 2024 Democratic ticket even attracted a pair of ex-Republican members of Congress.\n\nOne of them, James Greenwood, represented Pennsylvania\u2019s Eighth Congressional District from 1993 to 2005.\n\nHe told The Independent that he understood Biden had to stand down after his debate performance against Trump.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re never going to unsee it, that\u2019s always going to be in the commercials. It\u2019s always going to be on the internet,\u201d he said.\n\nGreenwood, who is involved in the Republicans for Harris coalition affiliated with the Harris-Walz campaign, said it was hard to recruit anyone to the pro-Harris GOP effort after the debate, but he described the vibe after Biden stood down as \u201clike an electric charge.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve seen it. You know, the excitement, the volunteers, the fundraising, so everyone\u2019s pretty excited,\u201d he said.\n\nGreenwood also told The Independent he\u2019d been \u201call in\u201d for Harris to select Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, but he also had kind words for the Minnesota governor.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve seen of Governor Walz is that he\u2019s a very down to earth guy, very likable guy, and I think they\u2019ll make a great team,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother former Republican Congressman, Tea Party firebrand turned outspoken Never Trump commentator Joe Walsh, said Walz is just what Democrats need to appeal to working-class voters and shake off the party\u2019s image as a collection of effete elites.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s like an everyman \u2014 the Democrats have had trouble with blue collar regular workers and that\u2019s right up Walz\u2019s alley,\u201d he said. \u201cThis guy can go into any pool hall, any VFW, and he\u2019s down more than Shapiro is. I disagree with him on a lot of policy, but he\u2019s like a regular guy, and that\u2019s what Democrats have to have.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Harris campaign releases video introducing Walz as running mate\n\nTuesday 6 August 2024 22:22 , Josh Marcus\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nHow\u2019s the Harris campaign going to introduce Tim Walz to the nation?\n\nToday, we got our first peek.\n\nHere\u2019s a mini bio the campaign released talking about the Minnesota governor\u2019s long career in public service.\n\nShapiro praises \u2018battle-tested' Harris at Philadelphia rally\n\nTuesday 6 August 2024 22:32 , Josh Marcus\n\nPennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro is speaking at today\u2019s rally, and he walked out to a huge roar of applause.\n\n\u201cI want you to know I am going to continue to pour my heart and soul into serving you every single day and I\u2019m going to be working my tail off to make sure we make Kamala Harris and Tim Walz the next leaders of the United States of America,\u201d the Democrat told the crowd.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nHe praised Harris as \u201ccourtroom tough\u201d and \u201cbattle-tested and ready to go.\u201d\n\nThe Trump years, meanwhile, were marked with \u201cmore chaos\u201d and \u201cless freedom,\u201d as well as declining abortion rights, Shapiro said.\n\nMention of JD Vance prompts chants of \u2018He\u2019s a weirdo'\n\nTuesday 6 August 2024 22:37 , Josh Marcus\n\nAt the mere mention of JD Vance just now, the crowd just erupted into chants of, \u201cHe\u2019s a weirdo.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s more than likely because of Tim Walz, who memorably branded the Trump-Vance campaign \u201cweirdos\u201d in a series of widely seen TV appearances and speeches.\n\nLearn more about the roots of this campaign dig.\n\nHow Tim Walz became beloved by young voters with a message that the GOP is 'weird'\n\nShapiro offers ringing endorsement of Harris-Walz campaign\n\nTuesday 6 August 2024 22:46 , Josh Marcus\n\nJosh Shapiro may\u2019ve just been passed over for being Kamala Harris\u2019s running mate, but he certainly doesn\u2019t sound like it.\n\nThe Pennsylvania governor is in the middle of a pumped-up speech touting the campaign as one defending \u201creal freedom.\u201d He also called Tim Walz a \u201cgreat patriot\u201d and personal friend.\n\nShapiro argued on Tuesday that the Democrats are the right choice for their positions on reproductive freedom, investments in public education, environmentalism, LBGTQ+ issues and other topics.\n\n\u201cThis election is about all of you, and whether or not you\u2019re willing to do this hard work to fight for our freedom,\u201d he said.\n\nTeacher, coach and family man: Tim Walz is the Midwest dad courting the White House\n\nTuesday 6 August 2024 22:47 , Josh Marcus\n\nThe governorship of Minnesota may have launched Tim Waltz onto the national stage \u2013 and now into a battle for the White House \u2013 but it was the former teacher\u2019s wife who brought him to the Land of 10,000 Lakes in the first place.\n\nGwen Walz, nee Whipple, was born and raised in Minnesota before making a fateful foray after college into teaching across the border in Nebraska; there, she met another young educator and member of the Army National Guard. Tim Walz had grown up in West Point, a small Cornhusker enclave nearly 300 miles south of his future wife\u2019s hometown, and already counted several years of military service under his belt when he decided to ask Gwen out.\n\nThanks to encouragement from her sister, she agreed; their first date at the only movie theater in town \u2013 followed by a stop at Hardee\u2019s, naturally \u2013 soon blossomed into a romance, then a 1994 marriage. Exactly 30 years later, the two teachers and their two children now proudly hold the title of First Family of Minnesota \u2014 while throwing their hats in the ring for Second Family of America.\n\nSheila Flynn has more on the Midwest roots of Walz.\n\nPhotos capture first Harris-Walz rally\n\nTuesday 6 August 2024 22:48 , Josh Marcus\n\nKamala Harris and Tim Walz were in Philadelphia on Tuesday for their first campaign rally together.\n\nHere\u2019s what the scene looked like on the ground.\n\n(Getty Images)\n\nPennsylvania Gov.

The officer who stopped Walz smelled a \u201cstrong odor of alcoholic beverage\u201d, according to the police report.\n\nAfter failing a field sobriety test and preliminary breath test, Walz was taken to a local jail in Dawes County, Nebraska.\n\nThe incident took place 11 years before Walz first pursued political office as Minnesota\u2019s First Congressional District Representative.\n\nAriana Baio has the details.\n\nThe truth behind Tim Walz\u2019s 1995 DUI arrest and how it changed his life\n\n\u2018Thank you for bringing back the joy'\n\nTuesday 6 August 2024 23:42 , Josh Marcus\n\n(Getty Images)\n\nTim Walz is making that case that he and Kamala Harris will be happy warriors on behalf of the middle class and common decency.\n\n\u201cThank you for bringing back the joy,\u201d Walz began, praising Harris for her uplifting style.\n\nThe Minnesota governor also connected his small town upbringing working on a family farm to the values he said he\u2019ll bring to the White House.\n\n\u201cMy mom and dad taught us, show generosity toward your neighbors, and work for the common good,\u201d he said.\n\nWalz said this approach couldn\u2019t be more different than Trump\u2019s.\n\n\u201cHe froze in the face of the covid crisis,\u201d Walz said. \u201cHe drove our economy into the ground. And make no mistake, violent crime was up under Donald Trump \u2014 that\u2019s not even counting the crimes he committed.\u201d\n\nWalz gets personal talking about reproductive care\n\nTuesday 6 August 2024 23:48 , Josh Marcus\n\nTim Walz is arguing that the Republican position on abortion rights and other forms of reproductive care go against Minnesota\u2019s golden rule: \u201cMind your own damn business.\u201d\n\nThe Minnesota governor said there was a time when Republicans believed in freedom, but that has turned out to mean the \u201cfreedom to invade your doctor\u2019s office.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic leader also spoke personally about his family\u2019s efforts to conceive a child through IVF, and the long stretches where it seemed the procedure wouldn\u2019t take.\n\nEventually, when their daughter was born, they named her Hope.\n\nWalz savages JD Vance as out of touch and \u2018weird as hell'\n\nWednesday 7 August 2024 00:00 , Josh Marcus\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to imagine why Tim Walz once won a state football championship when he was a high school coach.\n\nThe Minnesota governor practically gave a halftime pump-up speech today in Philadelphia, and he reserved his most passionate section for his rivals on the (political) field, savaging Ohio senator and Trump running mate JD Vance as an out-of-touch elite, despite their shared Midwest roots.\n\n\u201cLike all regular people I grew up with in the heartland, JD studied at Yale, had his career funded by Silicon Valley billionaires, and then wrote a best seller trashing that community,\u201d Walz said, to hoots from the crowd.\n\n\u201cCome on, that\u2019s not what Middle America is,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd I got to tell you. I can\u2019t wait to debate the guy ... That is, if he\u2019s willing to get off the couch and show up.\u201d\n\nThe Democrat also accused Vance and Trump of being \u201cweird as hell.\u201d\n\nRead more here to learn about why Vance is increasingly coming under fire from even those within his party.\n\n\u2018Racist\u2019 Mountain Dew, cat ladies \u2014 and eyeliner?

If Trump gets a chance to return, he\u2019s going to pick up exactly where he left off four years ago, only this time it\u2019ll be much, much worse.\u201d\n\nVIDEO: Walz claims GOP is breaking the Minnesota \u2018golden rule\u2019 on abortion\n\nWednesday 7 August 2024 00:30 , Josh Marcus\n\nTim Walz is hoping to connect his Midwest values to the 2024 campaign.\n\nOn the subject of abortion, Walz said the GOP opposition to abortion goes against Minnesota\u2019s \u201cgolden rule,\u201d of \u201cmind your own damn business.\u201d\n\nBest pics from Harris-Walz rally\n\nWednesday 7 August 2024 00:33 , Graeme Massie\n\n(AP)\n\n(Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Here\u2019s why\n\n01:00 , Josh Marcus\n\nThe wait is over. Vice President Kamala Harris has finally picked her running mate in Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. Walz has become a favorite of online progressives recently, largely because of his \u201cweird\u201d attacks on Republicans. But there are also solid policy reasons why Walz is beloved of the left wing of the party. He went from a pro-gun rural Democrat in Congress to a governor who has signed legislation that protects abortion rights and LGBTQ+ rights, enacted background checks on guns, and expanded free school meals regardless of income.\n\nBack in August 2023, I tweeted: \u201cWalz would be a strong choice for Harris if she were to be the nominee\u201d.\n\nAlmost a year later, after Biden\u2019s debacle of a debate performance, just as Walz and other Democratic governors did a stakeout in front of the White House, I suggested him as a potential running mate for Harris if Biden dropped out. \u201cVeteran, longtime congressman from rural Minnesota. Popular governor who has passed major pieces of progressive legislation,\u201d is how I summarized my reasons why.\n\nMore from Eric Garcia.\n\nI predicted a Harris-Walz ticket a year ago.

Shapiro, who is Jewish, was among several others tipped to be in the running.\n\nSome critics suggested that Shapiro had been sidelined because of his faith. Former Harvard law professor and controversial lawyer, Alan Dershowitz, wrote on X:\u201dDid Harris reject Shapiro because progressives don\u2019t like that he\u2019s Jewish?\u201d\n\nMike Bedigan has the details.\n\nHarris campaign denies claim Shapiro was rejected for VP because of Jewish faith\n\nThe biggest moments from tonight\u2019s Harris-Walz kickoff rally\n\n01:40 , Josh Marcus\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz made their debut as the presumptive Democratic presidential ticket, kicking off a campaign against Donald Trump and JD Vance in front of a roaring crowd in Philadelphia.\n\nThe North Star State executive strode on stage in front of an electricfied crowd at Temple University\u2019s Licouras Center on Tuesday just hours after Harris announced him as her running mate, ending the closely watched contest for the next potential vice president by choosing the seasoned midwestern politician, military veteran and former school teacher with a progressive track record.\n\nHarris told the estimated 12,000 people in attendance that she\u2019d \u201cset out to find a partner who can build this brighter future\u201d that she has spoke of from the stump during her weeks-old campaign for the presidency.\n\nShe added that her search for a running-mate led her to look for a \u201cleader who can unite this nation and move us forward,\u201d someone who was \u201ca fighter for the middle class\u201d and a patriot who believes as I do the extraordinary promise of America, a promise of freedom, opportunity and justice not just for some but for all.\u201d\n\nAndrew Feinberg and Alex Woodward have the latest.\n\nTim Walz fires up Democrats in first speech as Kamala Harris\u2019s running mate\n\nPhotos: Tim Walz\u2019s unlikely rise to be the Democratic VP nominee\n\n01:47 , Josh Marcus\n\nA photo of Tim Walz during his early days in the National Guard (Kamala Harris for President)\n\nA photo of Tim Walz during his time as a public school teacher in Mankato, Minnesota (Kamala Harris for President)\n\nTim Walz during his campaign for governor of Minnesota (AFP/Getty)\n\nElection 2024 Harris (Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Republicans worry he might be...\n\n03:45 , Oliver O'Connell\n\nRepublicans are concerned that their party leader Donald Trump is having a \u201cpublic nervous breakdown\u201d after he made a series of offensive outbursts about Vice President Kamala Harris as he slips behind her in the polls.\n\nPerhaps collapsing under the weight of Harris\u2019 growing campaign support, the former president has made a number of insulting personal attacks against his Democratic rival. Last week, Trump questioned the vice president\u2019s racial identity at the National Association of Black Journalists conference. Over the weekend, he accused Harris of having a \u201clow IQ.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, new polls indicate Trump is slipping behind the vice president in the popular vote and races are tightening in battleground states.\n\nKelly Rissman reports.\n\nRepublicans worry Trump is having a \u2018public nervous breakdown\u2019\n\nHow Walz might help \u2013 or hurt \u2013 Harris\u2019 chances\n\n04:15 , Namita Singh\n\nOpting for the Minnesota governor immediately calms the Democratic Party\u2019s left wing, which was worried that another contender, Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro, might have pushed the party closer to Israel and disheartened Arab American and younger voters.\n\nSome in Kamala Harris\u2019 inner circle saw Mr Walz as a do-no-harm choice who can keep the party unified heading into the Democratic National Convention opening in Chicago on 19 August.\n\nProgressives are already celebrating Mr Walz\u2019s ability to deliver an unapologetically populist message in the style of a Midwestern dad who recalls the social studies teacher and football coach he once was.\n\nActivists who for months have followed Joe Biden around the country to protest his full-throated support for Israel in its war with Hamas in Gaza are hopeful that Mr Walz will help Harris take a more nuanced approach than someone like Shapiro.\n\nBut some critics will point to 2016, when the only other woman to be nominated for president, Hillary Clinton, picked a mild-mannered dad with centrist views and a modest national profile: Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia. That ticket lost to Donald Trump.\n\nCori Bush becomes second Squad member to lose her primary\n\n04:23 , Namita Singh\n\nDemocratic representative Cori Bush became the second member of the Squad to lose her primary as county prosecutor Wesley Bell beat her in a grueling and expensive primary on Tuesday evening.\n\nPro-Israel groups spent massive amounts of money to depose Bush in the district where she pulled off an upset victory against a longtime incumbent Democrat in 2020.\n\nThe United Democracy Project, a super PAC of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, spent $9.2m against Bush, according to AdImpact.

Governor Peggy Flanagan would ascend to the governor\u2019s office, if Harris-Walz defeats Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance in 2024.\n\nFlanagan \u2014 a citizen of the White Earth Band of Ojibwe \u2014 would also become the state\u2019s first-ever female governor.\n\nAlex Woodward has the details.\n\nHarris-Walz could clear path for first-ever Native American woman governor\n\nVance offers battleground counterprogram to Walz\n\n04:49 , Namita Singh\n\nJD Vance is set to follow an overlapping itinerary to Kamala Harris and Tim Walz over the next two days, including stops in the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\nHis role is to attack the Biden administration\u2019s policies and tear down Ms Harris\u2019 record on the economy, public safety and immigration.\n\nMr Vance got out ahead of the Democrats in Philadelphia on Tuesday, holding an event hours before Ms Harris was to formally introduce her new running mate at a rally.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris holds rally with vice president pick Tim Walz, in Philadelphia (Reuters)\n\nHe said during his Philadelphia stop that \u201cI absolutely want to debate Tim Walz,\u201d but not until after the Democratic convention.Ms Harris\u2019 team seemed to be happy to have Vance making the contrast with the Democrats.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate JD Vance providing voters in battleground states exactly the split-screen that defines the choice this November,\u201d said Ms Harris campaign spokesperson Charles Lutvak.\n\nMichigan will choose between Democrat Elissa Slotkin and Republican Mike Rogers\n\n05:18 , Namita Singh\n\nFormer US representative Mike Rogers has secured the Republican nomination for a US Senate seat in Michigan and will face Democratic representative Elissa Slotkin in the November election.\n\nMs Slotkin and Mr Rogers, long considered the front-runners for their respective party nominations, will now shift focus to the general election. Ms Slotkin enters with a massive fundraising advantage and emerges nearly unscathed from a sparse primary, while Mr Rogers has the backing of national Republican groups and former President Donald Trump.\n\nFormer representative Mike Rogers and Representative Elissa Slotkin are set to face each other in November election (AP)\n\nMs Slotkin defeated actor Hill Harper in the Democratic primary, while Republicans chose Mr Rogers over former US representative Justin Amash and physician Sherry O\u2019Donnell. Both candidates will now compete for a seat left open by longtime Democratic senator Debbie Stabenow\u2019s retirement.\n\nThe retiring incumbent joined Ms Slotkin onstage at an event in Detroit shortly after the race was called to endorse her. Ms Slotkin praised Stabenow for her years of service before delivering a speech positioning herself as the \u201cnormal\u201d and \u201crational\u201d candidate.\n\nNorth of Detroit, in Oakland County, Mr Rogers thanked supporters at a watch party for \u201cnot giving up on politics.\u201d Like Ms Slotkin, Mr Rogers represented a mid-Michigan swing district in Congress, and he similarly positioned himself as the commonsense candidate in his speech. No Republican has won a US Senate race in Michigan since 1994.\n\nWith Democrats holding a razor-thin majority in the Senate and Republicans in the House, competitive races like those in Michigan are drawing lots of attention.\n\nIt\u2019s a vibes election \u2013 and Harris has picked the perfect running mate for the job\n\n05:19 , Namita Singh\n\nThey\u2019re calling it a vibes election.\n\nVibes are notoriously hard to spot, and they don\u2019t always show up in polls, but as Kamala Harris took to the stage in a cavernous auditorium at Temple University in Philadelphia on Tuesday with her new running mate, they were measurable in the screams and shouts of 12,000 people.\n\nThe replacement of Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket by Ms Harris has changed the energy in the room. And Ms Harris\u2019s choice of Minnesota governor Tim Walz as her vice presidential candidate is a sign that she is banking on that energy taking her to the White House.\n\nMy colleague Richard Hall reports:\n\nIt\u2019s a vibes election - and Harris has picked the perfect running mate for the job\n\nWesley Bell defeats 'Squad' member Cori Bush\n\n05:43 , Namita Singh\n\nSt Louis County prosecuting attorney Wesley Bell has defeated US representative Cori Bush in a Democratic primary in St Louis, marking the second time this year that one of the party\u2019s incumbents has been ousted in an expensive contest that reflected deep divisions over the war in Gaza.\n\nMs Bush, a member of the progressive congressional group known as the \u201cSquad,\u201d was seeking a third term in Missouri\u2019s 1st Congressional District, which includes St Louis city and part of St Louis County. Mr Bell is heavily favored to carry this overwhelmingly Democratic district in November, when his party is aiming to retake control of the US House.\n\nI am committed to serving the St Louis region in Congress with integrity, transparency, and dedication...Together, we will tackle the challenges ahead and build a community where everyone has the opportunity to thrive.\u201d\n\nWesley Bell\n\nMs Bush, in a fiery concession speech, said she still has work to do, even if she\u2019ll no longer be in Congress.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, whether I\u2019m a congresswoman or not, I\u2019m still taking care of my people,\u201d Ms Bush said.\n\nWhat to know about Tim Walz\u2019s origin story\n\n05:45 , Josh Marcus\n\nThe governorship of Minnesota may have launched Tim Waltz onto the national stage \u2013 and now into a battle for the White House \u2013 but it was the former teacher\u2019s wife who brought him to the Land of 10,000 Lakes in the first place.\n\nGwen Walz, nee Whipple, was born and raised in Minnesota before making a fateful foray after college into teaching across the border in Nebraska; there, she met another young educator and member of the Army National Guard. Tim Walz had grown up in West Point, a small Cornhusker enclave nearly 300 miles south of his future wife\u2019s hometown, and already counted several years of military service under his belt when he decided to ask Gwen out.\n\nThanks to encouragement from her sister, she agreed; their first date at the only movie theater in town \u2013 followed by a stop at Hardee\u2019s, naturally \u2013 soon blossomed into a romance, then a 1994 marriage. Exactly 30 years later, the two teachers and their two children now proudly hold the title of First Family of Minnesota \u2014 while throwing their hats in the ring for Second Family of America.\n\nFamily \u2013 both the one who raised him and the one he\u2019s built with Gwen \u2013 has deeply molded Walz\u2019s professional path and political positions.\n\nSheila Flynn has the full story.\n\nTeacher, coach and family man: Tim Walz is the Midwest dad courting the White House\n\nRepublican activist becomes first person to be convicted in Arizona\u2019s fake elector case\n\n05:49 , Namita Singh\n\nA Republican activist who signed a document falsely claiming Donald Trump had won Arizona in 2020 became the first person to be convicted in the state\u2019s fake elector case.\n\nLoraine Pellegrino, a past president of the group Ahwatukee Republican Women, has pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of filing a false document, Arizona Attorney General\u2019s Office spokesperson Richie Taylor said Tuesday, declining to comment further.\n\nRecords documenting her guilty plea haven\u2019t yet been posted by the court. Still, court records show Pellegrino was sentenced to unsupervised probation. Before the plea, she faced nine felony charges.\n\nSeventeen other people had been charged in the case, including 10 other Republicans who had signed a certificate saying they were \u201cduly elected and qualified\u201d electors and claimed Trump had carried Arizona in the 2020 election.\n\nPresident Joe Biden won Arizona by 10,457 votes. Joshua Kolsrud, an attorney representing Pellegrino, said in a statement that his client has accepted responsibility for her actions. \u201cLoraine Pellegrino\u2019s decision to accept a plea to a lesser charge reflects her desire to move forward and put this matter behind her,\u201d Kolsrud said.\n\nWashington state attorney general and Green River Killer detective advance in race for governorship\n\n06:30 , Namita Singh\n\nWashington state\u2019s longtime attorney general and a former sheriff known for his work hunting down the Green River Killer advanced on Tuesday to November\u2019s general election in the battle to become the next governor in a Democratic stronghold that hasn\u2019t had an open race for the state\u2019s top job in more than a decade.\n\nIn high profile congressional races, meanwhile, Democratic US representative Marie Gluesenkamp Perez advanced in the 3rd District and will face Donald Trump-endorsed Joe Kent, whom she defeated two years ago. And in the 8th District, Democratic US representative Kim Schrier will go head-to-head against Republican Carmen Goers, a commercial banker.\n\nFile: Marie Gluesenkamp Perez is pictured at the Capitol in Washington, 15 November 2022 (AP)\n\nA congressional race in the 4th District between US representative Dan Newhouse, one of the last remaining House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump, and two conservative rivals endorsed by the GOP presidential nominee was too early to call.\n\nUnder the state\u2019s primary system, the top two vote-getters in each of the contests advance to the November election, regardless of party. Because Washington is a vote-by-mail state, with ballots due to be postmarked by Election Day, it often takes days to learn final results in close races.\n\nMike Kehoe wins Republican nomination for governorship\n\n06:42 , Namita Singh\n\nMissouri voters have nominated Lt Governor Mike Kehoe to be the Republican candidate for governor, making the governor\u2019s race his to lose.\n\nSpeaking to a crowd of supporters in Jefferson City, Mr Kehoe described himself as an \u201cunderdog\u201d and said people doubted his campaign from the start.\u201cWe proved, once again, the American dream is still alive,\u201d Mr Kehoe said.\n\nMike Kehoe points to the crowd after announcing his win of Missouri Governor on Tuesday, 6 August 2024 (AP)\n\nMr Kehoe edged out Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft and state Sen. Bill Eigel to win the GOP nomination, a huge advantage in a strongly conservative state currently without any Democratic statewide officials.\n\nMr Kehoe will face off in November against state House Minority Leader Crystal Quade, who won the Democratic nomination.Republican governor Mike Parson is barred from seeking reelection by term limits.\n\nTrump leads Republican meltdown as Tim Walz unveiled as Harris\u2019 VP pick\n\n06:45 , Oliver O'Connell\n\nDonald Trump is leading the Republican party\u2019s meltdown over Kamala Harris\u2019s vice presidential pick, dramatically claiming that Tim Walz will \u201cunleash HELL ON EARTH.\u201d\n\nHarris announced on Tuesday that she had chosen Walz \u2013 the man who coined the now-infamous \u201cweird\u201d moniker for their Republican rivals \u2013 to join her on the Democratic ticket to take on Trump and JD Vance in the November election.\n\nThe announcement soon provoked an unhinged reaction from the former president whose campaign fired off a fundraising email warning that \u201cTim Walz would be the worst VP in history!\u201d\n\nJoe Sommerlad has the story.\n\nTrump leads Republican meltdown as Walz unveiled as Harris\u2019 VP pick: \u2018HELL ON EARTH\u2019\n\nKansas' former attorney general wins the Republican nomination for an open congressional seat\n\n06:48 , Namita Singh\n\nA former Kansas attorney general and failed candidate for governor has found at least initial success in his political comeback attempt, winning Tuesday\u2019s Republican primary for an open US House seat.\n\nFormer Kansas attorney general Derek Schmidt prevailed in the primary in the 2nd District of eastern Kansas over Jeff Kahrs, a former top regional federal health official, and Shawn Tiffany, a rancher. Even though Kahrs worked in former president Donald Trump\u2019s administration, Mr Schmidt won Trump\u2019s endorsement.\n\nIn the Democratic primary, former US representative Nancy Boyda, who held the 2nd District seat in 2007 and 2008, defeated Matt Kleinmann, a public health advocate who was a member of the 2008 national champion University of Kansas men\u2019s basketball team.\n\nMs Boyda won the nomination even though she riled up some party activists by positioning herself toward the political center for what she saw as a more viable general election campaign in the Republican-leaning district. She lost her 2008 race for reelection.\n\nMs Boyda was the last Democrat to represent eastern Kansas in Congress, and the district became redder after the GOP-controlled Legislature redrew it two years ago.\n\nMr Schmidt, who is also a former state senator, raised the most money of any candidate, more than $616,000, including more than $119,000 since mid-July alone, according to campaign finance reports.\u201cAmerica needs more effective, conservative voices in public service,\u201d Mr Schmidt said in a statement.\n\n\u201cI will continue to prioritize securing our border, stopping inflation, and rolling back big government\u2019s overregulation and over-taxation of our daily lives.\u201d\n\nWas Tim Walz arrested for a DUI?\n\n07:45 , Josh Marcus\n\nTim Walz chose to stop drinking alcohol in 1995 after he was arrested for driving under the influence, a story that has resurfaced after Vice President Kamala Harris announced the Minnesota Governor as her running mate.\n\nOn September 23, 1995, Walz, a 31-year-old, newlywed, high school teacher and football coach, was pulled over doing 96 miles per hour in a 55mph zone. The officer who stopped Walz smelled a \u201cstrong odor of alcoholic beverage\u201d, according to the police report.\n\nAfter failing a field sobriety test and preliminary breath test, Walz was taken to a local jail in Dawes County, Nebraska.\n\nThe incident took place 11 years before Walz first pursued political office as Minnesota\u2019s First Congressional District Representative.\n\nAriana Baio reports.\n\nThe truth behind Tim Walz\u2019s 1995 DUI arrest and how it changed his life\n\nI predicted a Harris-Walz ticket a year ago. Here\u2019s why\n\n08:45 , Eric Garcia\n\nEric Garcia writes:\n\nThe wait is over. Vice President Kamala Harris has finally picked her running mate in Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. Walz has become a favorite of online progressives recently, largely because of his \u201cweird\u201d attacks on Republicans. But there are also solid policy reasons why Walz is beloved of the left wing of the party. He went from a pro-gun rural Democrat in Congress to a governor who has signed legislation that protects abortion rights and LGBTQ+ rights, enacted background checks on guns, and expanded free school meals regardless of income.\n\nBack in August 2023, I tweeted: \u201cWalz would be a strong choice for Harris if she were to be the nominee\u201d.\n\nContinue reading...\n\nI predicted a Harris-Walz ticket a year ago.

        "text": "Democrats turn to influencers to help share their message on social media\nA look at how political campaigns use social media influencers\n\nAs social media feeds have become key battlegrounds in the race for the White House, Democrats are deploying a fleet of influencers to try to win over voters online.\n\nAwa Sanneh made a name for herself dispensing beauty tips on TikTok. When the 23-year-old posted a video of her White House bathroom break, her half-million followers took notice.\n\n\"I was just shocked. I was like, did you guys see that marble?\" Sanneh told CBS News.\n\nSanneh was one of a few dozen social media influencers who were invited to the White House to watch the State of the Union address and meet President Biden.\n\n\"He said to us, like, the collective presence in this room has more viewership on Gen Z than all of traditional media combined,\" she said.\n\nShe first heard from Democratic Super PACs, and then the Biden administration, after posting a video following the fall of Roe v. Wade that went viral.\n\n\"They started inviting me to their White House briefings on abortion rights, reproductive rights,\" Sanneh said.\n\nOn the right, Turning Point USA has mobilized influencers for years, raising nearly $200 million since 2020.\n\nNow, Democratic organizations are flooding the creator community with cash and providing behind-the-scenes access.\n\n\"We just have to be working with them. And if we're not, we're missing a huge way that voters are getting information about the world,\" said Rob Flaherty, who ran digital strategy in the Biden White House and now for the presidential campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nHe called the highly meme-able Harris a massive asset as the campaign reaches out to thousands of influencers.\n\n'We give them talking points, resources, base language, you know, graphics that they could repurpose or lift,\" he said of their campaign's work with influencers.\n\nAnd while Flaherty said the Harris campaign does not pay influencers directly, CBS News found a constellation of other Democratic political organizations that do.\n\nIn May, Future Forward \u2014 the super PAC supporting Harris \u2014 hosted panels like Gaming The Algorithm and How Advocacy Can Benefit Your Business. A spokesperson for the PAC did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSanneh said she was hired last month by Protect Our Care, a progressive advocacy group that relies on anonymous donors. She made a video warning about Trump's second term agenda that she says the group helped her script.\n\nShe said she takes their talking points and puts them in her own voice, saying she always discloses when she's being paid.\n\nWhile Sanneh would not say how much she's being paid, she did note, \"A video just for a creator in my size, an average can go from $3,000 to $10,000 and upwards.\"\n\nWhen it comes to hawking commercial products or sharing financial advice, federal rules require influencers to disclose when they are being paid. But in a rulemaking last December, the Federal Election Commission voted against similar requirements for influencers spreading political messaging.\n\nSam Woolley, the incoming Chair of Disinformation Studies at the University of Pittsburgh, says using influencers is \"a bid by campaigns to create authenticity at a small scale.\"\n\nBut he also noted that if people notice \"multiple influencers spreading the same exact message, you can start to realize like, 'hmm, some kind of coordination is going on.'\"\n\nFor Sanneh, her next stop is the Democratic National Convention, where she and other influencers have been invited to make more content\n\n\"They just told us that if we wanted to put on our own show that they would give us all the resources to do that,\" Sanneh said.\n\nWhen asked if she felt the Democrats were rolling out the red carpet for her and other influencers, she told CBS News, \"Definitely, and I'm glad to be on it.\"",

He means it, all this stuff about \u2018if we lose it will be a bloodbath\u2019.\u201d\n\nIn his first interview since he dramatically dropped out of the race last month, Mr Biden told CBS News: \u201cIf Trump loses, I'm not confident at all.\"\n\nUS President Joe Biden has said he is not confident there will be a peaceful transition of power if Donald Trump loses the presidential election in November.\n\nDemocrats were quick to reiterate their campaign message that the former president poses a threat to democracy. The Biden campaign used the \u201cbloodbath\u201d comment in an ad - posted on its social media accounts - and a spokesman accused Mr Trump of \u201cencouraging and excusing political violence\u201d.\n\nThe Trump campaign, however, said the comment was specifically about the auto industry and had been deliberately taken out of context. It sent a fundraising email which said Trump\u2019s political opponents and others had been \"viciously\" misquoting him.\n\n\"[They] fully understood that I was simply referring to imports allowed by Crooked Joe Biden, which are killing the automobile industry,\" Trump wrote on social media at the time.\n\nMr Biden has previously expressed concern that his former rival would not accept the result of the election.\n\nDuring the presidential debate on CNN in June - which triggered the crisis over Mr Biden's candidacy - Trump was asked directly whether he would accept the 2024 election results.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s a fair and legal and good election, absolutely,\" he responded, after initially avoiding the question.\n\nTrump made repeated unfounded claims of election fraud in 2020 after he lost that election to Mr Biden.\n\nHis supporters stormed the Capitol building in January 2021 in an effort to stop the election result from being certified. Many in attendance that day repeated the former president's claims that the vote had been rigged.\n\nIn the CBS interview clip released on Wednesday, which was posted on X, Mr Biden also appeared to suggest there were efforts to complicate the post-election certification processes, although it was unclear exactly what he was referring to.\n\n\u201cLook what they\u2019re trying to do now, in the local election districts where people count the votes,\u201d he said. \"You can't love your country only when you win.\"",

        "text": "Election\u2019s Impact on Commercial Real Estate\nInterest rates and optics in an election year\n\nInterest rates and inflation may be top of mind for multifamily investors as election day approaches, but the Federal Reserve bases its decisions solely on economic factors, not political ones.\n\nThe independence of the Fed to manage monetary policy without regard to political considerations is fundamental. The Fed has consistently and repeatedly said its decision to adjust policy rates will be based on evidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward its long-term 2% average target to help maintain this independence and avoid any charges of partisanship.\n\nThe last meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) before the election is September 18. The proximity to the election and recently published quarterly economic projections will add attention to the meeting. But even after September 18, rates could be volatile as the presumed outcome of the election could influence the future of inflation.\n\nPotential housing regulation stability\n\nWhile increased funding for multifamily housing is possible, it\u2019s largely dependent on Congress. Regardless of the next president, however, it\u2019s unlikely housing funding and policies will be rolled back.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve increasingly seen a frustration with the cost of housing across party lines,\u201d said Nick Luettke, Associate Economist at Moody\u2019s CRE.\n\nWhile both parties want more affordable housing, they\u2019re likely to take different approaches. If either party gains control over the House of Representatives, Senate and White House, housing policies could see significant changes.\n\nIt\u2019s a different story with a divided government. \u201cIn that case, federal housing policies will likely remain the same, with the level of political polarization in Congress impacting commercial real estate policymaking more than the presidential election,\u201d Luettke said.\n\nThe election and economy\u2019s impact on infrastructure spending\n\n\u201cWith either outcome, there will likely be continued federal investment via the Infrastructure and Jobs Act into roads, bridges, power and grid, passenger and freight rail, water infrastructure, housing, broadband, airports and more,\u201d Chambless said.\n\nIt\u2019s important to consider the role of Congress here. \u201cInfrastructure spending will likely remain fairly stable should a split Congress and president be elected, with greater expansion or cuts being easier should either party successfully sweep,\u201d Luettke said.\n\nAside from Congressional election outcomes, infrastructure spending often picks up during economic downturns in response to rising unemployment. So there\u2019s also a possibility either administration could pour funding into infrastructure, depending on the economic landscape.\n\nSuch continued investment could benefit commercial real estate. Take modular housing, for example. \u201cModular construction\u2019s factory-like approach really drives costs down,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cThe negative is it\u2019s extremely expensive to move modular housing.\u201d\n\n\u201cInfrastructure spending is likely to depend more on macroeconomic health and whether deficit reduction or a stimulus is more necessary for a struggling labor market,\u201d Luettke said.\n\nReal estate and strategic supply chain spending\n\nLuettke noted that infrastructure legislation related to national security and supporting supply chains is the most vulnerable to geopolitical developments. It\u2019s also the most likely to be favored across administrations and congressional outcomes.\n\nBoth potential administrations appear to be acting tough with China on trade. Homeshoring and nearshoring are likely to continue regardless of election results. Both efforts can help commercial real estate and multifamily reduce development timelines and costs.\n\n\u201cIn the last eight years, conventional wisdom toward free-trade agreements has nearly disappeared,\u201d Luettke said. \u201cInstead, supply chain choices have increasingly been viewed as part of broader strategic relationships combining domestic protectionism of key industries with security,\u201d he said. Both potential administrations are likely to continue this approach.\n\n\u201cThere could be a number of impacts to global supply chains, including the prioritization of domestic investment, implementation of trade tariffs, and rebalanced and renegotiated trading relationships,\u201d Chambless said.",

        "text": "Election 2024: Trump and Harris say they've agreed to Sept. 10 debate\nDemocratic veterans in the House rushed to Walz\u2019s defense today \u2014 amid attacks from Republicans on the Minnesota governor's military record \u2014 and hit Trump over his lack of military service.\n\nRepublicans, including JD Vance, have attacked Walz in recent days over his military service.\n\nRep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., who did multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan as a U.S. Army Ranger, said Walz, who served in the National Guard for 24 years, had a \u201clong and honorable service record.\"\n\nWalz officially retired from the Minnesota National Guard in May 2005. His unit was alerted about a deployment to Iraq in July, and the unit deployed there in October. Walz filed to run for Congress in January 2005 with paperwork that was certified by the Federal Election Commission the next month.\n\nShow more\n\n\u201cContrast all of that with these old and tired attacks by the other side,\u201d Crow said. \u201cThey just don\u2019t have anything. They have no ideas. They have no options, but to try to do one of the worst things you can do in America: That is attack a veteran for their service. It\u2019s old. It\u2019s tired.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmerica is just not going to put up with it. And we\u2019re not going to put up with it,\u201d Crow said. \u201cIt\u2019s not OK.\u201d\n\nRep. Jake Auchincloss, D-Mass., who commanded troops in Afghanistan, hit Trump over having received a draft deferment in 1968 for bone spurs in his heels \u2014 allowing him to avoid serving during the Vietnam War.\n\n\u201cIf I were Donald Trump, with five deferments from Vietnam \u2026 I would be very cautious about opening the door to attacks on those who served honorably,\u201d Auchincloss said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re Swift-boating him,\u201d he added \u2014 referring to the 2004 effort by Republicans who attacked then-Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry\u2019s record as a Navy officer in Vietnam. \u201cWe\u2019re just not going to stand for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thank JD Vance for his service, but his political career and his political positions are antithetical to the values of veterans, and Donald Trump has a long track record of disparaging veterans. He called those who gave their last full measure of devotion losers.\u201d\n\nThat comment was a reference to a 2020 report in The Atlantic that Trump had canceled a 2018 visit to an American cemetery near Paris because he felt that those who\u2019d lost their lives and been buried there were \u201closers.\u201d The magazine cited \u201cfour people with firsthand knowledge of those discussions.\u201d Several media outlets confirmed the remarks, which Trump has denied. Trump\u2019s former White House chief of staff John Kelly also said those specific comments were accurate.",

        "text": "Historic First for California: 16- and 17-Year-Olds\u2026\nIn a historic first for California, the County of Alameda, the City of Oakland, the City of Berkeley, the Oakland Unified School District, and the Berkeley Unified School District are pleased to announce that 16- and 17-year-olds in Oakland and Berkeley will be able to vote in their respective elections for school board in November 2024.\n\nThis historic expansion of the local franchise is thanks to the passage of Measure Y1, approved by over 70 percent of voters in Berkeley in 2016, and of Measure QQ, approved in 2020 with 2/3 support of Oakland voters.\n\nThe Alameda County Registrar of Voters is using California\u2019s pre-registration system\u2013the system that allows 16- and 17-year-olds to pre-register to vote in California as a whole\u2013as the system to register 16- and 17-year-olds to vote in their local school board races in Oakland or Berkeley. Therefore, a resident of Oakland or Berkeley who is 16- or 17- years old and who is otherwise eligible must use California\u2019s pre-registration system (https://registertovote.ca.gov) to register to vote as a \u201cyouth voter.\u201d Any 16- or 17- year-old residing in Oakland or Berkeley who previously pre-registered to vote will be automatically registered as a youth voter.\n\n\u201cI am very pleased to have the technology and processes in place to deliver youth voting, passed by the voters of Berkeley and Oakland through Measures Y1 and QQ,\u201d said Alameda County Registrar of Voters Tim Dupuis. \u201cThis has never been done before in California and we had to make sure that it was done properly. I would like to thank the Board of Supervisors for their support in helping make it possible for 16- and 17-year-olds in Oakland and Berkeley to vote for school board in November 2024.\u201d\n\n\u201cVoting is not just a right but a civic duty, and extending this right to 16- and 17-year-olds will foster a culture of civic participation from an early age. I am grateful to Oakland Council President Nikki Bas, Councilmember Rebecca Kaplan, and the Oakland City Clerk\u2019s team for all their hard work and leadership to make this new program a reality,\u201d said Oakland Mayor Sheng Thao.\n\n\u201cYoung people are directly affected by the decisions made by their local school boards,\u201d said OUSD Board of Education President Sam Davis. \u201cLowering the voting age to 16 ensures that their perspectives are represented in the democratic process and will compel local politicians to address their concerns.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy giving 16-17 year-olds the right to vote about their education, we help to create lifelong voters who are more likely to participate in future local and national elections,\u201d said Berkeley Mayor Jesse Arregu\u00edn. \u201cEarly involvement fosters a sense of civic duty and strengthens our democracy for generations to come.\u201d\n\n\u201cBerkeley has been working to bring youth voting to fruition for several years,\u201d said Berkeley Unified School Board President Ana Vasudeo.\u201d We\u2019re excited to empower our youth to exercise one of their most important civic duties this November.\u201d\n\nThe technical capability enabling youth to vote in this election is the culmination of years of work by the Registrar of Voters with support and direction from the Alameda County Board of Supervisors, the four involved local jurisdictions (City of Oakland, City of Berkeley, Oakland USD, and Berkeley USD), the team from Runbeck Elections Services, Inc. (the vendor for Alameda County\u2019s election management system), and community-based advocacy organizations. What might have seemed simple in 2016 when Measure Y1 was first passed turned out to require a complicated process in which every aspect of the election\u2014from voter registration to ballot mailing to ballot counting\u2014needed to be mapped, programmed, and tested specifically for youth voters. This process, while lengthy, was necessary to ensure the integrity of the election for both youth voters and traditional voters.\n\nKey Information/Dates for the November 5, 2024, election:\n\nVoter Information Guides will be mailed to all voters, including youth voters, starting Thursday, September 26, 2024.\n\nAll voters, including youth voters, will be mailed a mail ballot starting the week of October 7, 2024.\n\nThe last day for all voters, including youth voters, to register online to vote is Monday, October 21, 2024, although all voters, including youth voters, may register to vote in person at the Registrar of Voters\u2019 office (1225 Fallon St., Oakland) through Election Day.\n\nThe last day for all voters, including youth voters, to request a mail ballot replacement is Tuesday, October 29, 2024.\n\nIn addition, from when early voting begins on Monday, October 7, 2024, through Election Day on Tuesday, November 5, 2024, youth voters can vote in person at the Registrar of Voters\u2019 office (1225 Fallon St., Oakland).\n\nWithin the United States, only five small municipalities in Maryland (with a combined total population of all ages of only around 80,000) permit youth voting. Given the larger populations of Berkeley and Oakland, the potential youth vote in each of these two California cities is greater than all the Maryland municipalities combined.",
