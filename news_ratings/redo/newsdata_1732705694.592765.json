        "text": "Trump special counsel files new election interference indictment\nTrump faces revised 2020 election interference charges\n\nGetty Images\n\nUS prosecutors have issued revised charges against Donald Trump for the former president's alleged attempts to interfere in the 2020 election after losing the contest. The updated wording tries to navigate a Supreme Court ruling that presidents have broad immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts. The ruling had thrown this case into doubt. Trump denies accusations that he pressured officials to reverse the results, knowingly spread lies about election fraud and sought to exploit a riot at the US Capitol to delay the certification of Joe Biden's victory. It appears unlikely the case - and other criminal cases he faces - will reach court before the next election on 5 November.\n\nThe revised indictment, brought by Department of Justice (DoJ) Special Counsel Jack Smith, leaves in place the four crimes Trump is accused of committing: conspiracy to defraud the US, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, attempting to obstruct an official proceeding, and conspiracy against rights. But these now relate to Trump's status as a political candidate rather than a sitting president. Trump has partial immunity from prosecution, Supreme Court rules Trump has previously pleaded not guilty to all charges. He wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform that the fresh indictment was \"an effort to resurrect a 'dead' Witch Hunt\" and \"distract the American People\" from this year's election. He called for it to be \"dismissed IMMEDIATELY\". His campaign has not responded to a BBC request for comment. But a source close to his legal team told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, the second indictment \"was not a surprise\". \"This is what the government is supposed to do based on what the Supreme Court did,\" the source said. \"It doesn't change our position that we believe Smith's case is flawed and it should be dismissed.\"\n\nWhat's changed - and what hasn't?\n\nThe new charging document - which was slimmed down from 45 to 36 pages - re-works the language of the allegations to respond to last month's ruling on presidential immunity by the Supreme Court. It argues Trump acted as a private citizen - and not as president - when he undertook the alleged scheme to sway the election. \u201cThe defendant had no official responsibilities related to the certification proceeding, but he did have a personal interest as a candidate in being named the winner of the election,\u201d reads one new line in the indictment. Another new line refers to a lawsuit filed by Trump's campaign in Georgia. The old language said the suit was \u201cfiled in his name\u201d, but the updated indictment says it was \u201cfiled in his capacity as a candidate for president\u201d. The new document also appears to have removed the charges against Jeffrey Clark - a former DoJ official who played a key role in the so-called fake electors scheme, according to prosecutors. Mr Clark was not named in either indictment, but has been identified in the media through public records. The fresh indictment also drops the claim that Trump tried to pressure DoJ officials to work to overturn his defeat. The high court ruled Trump's direction to justice officials was not illegal. The special counsel's office said the superseding indictment had been presented to a new grand jury that had not previously heard evidence in the case. A grand jury is set up by a prosecutor to determine whether there is enough evidence to pursue a prosecution.\n\nThe new indictment leaves in place several key allegations against Trump, including that he attempted to persuade Vice-President Mike Pence to obstruct Mr Biden\u2019s election certification. That is despite the fact that conversations between Trump and Mr Pence would probably fall under the category of \"official\" acts, for which Trump has immunity from prosecution, according to the Supreme Court ruling. The revised indictment showed that Mr Smith interpreted the Supreme Court ruling to mean that his case could still move forward, said Prof Daniel Richman, a constitutional law expert at Columbia Law School. But whether it would satisfy the Supreme Court's presidential immunity framework remained unclear, Prof Richman told the BBC. \"The court was painfully vague as to what private conduct done by a president can be charged criminally,\" he said.\n\nReuters Trump is accused of trying to thwart Joe Biden's victory at the last election - including by exploiting a riot at the US Capitol on 6 January 2021\n\nTrump's other legal issues\n\nThe revised indictment would not necessarily expedite the case, Prof Richman said. He doubted it would be heard before the 2024 election. The CBS News source close to Trump's legal team said the former president's lawyers would ask for more time to prepare for the case. They said this would likely delay the start of the trial if the judge agreed. This case came together after Mr Smith was appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland in 2022 to oversee two federal investigations into Trump: the election interference case and another case in which the ex-president has been accused of taking classified documents back to his Florida home after leaving office. On Monday, Mr Smith\u2019s team appealed against the decision of a Florida judge to dismiss the latter case. Judge Aileen Cannon had done so on the grounds that the mere existence of special counsels violated the US Constitution. Mr Smith argued the judge's view \"deviated\" from legal precedent. A guide to Trump's criminal cases Both cases face uncertain futures after the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark decision. The same is true of a separate case in Georgia, in which Trump and 18 other defendants are also accused of criminally conspiring to overturn his narrow defeat in 2020. He has pleaded not guilty, and a trial date has not been set. Meanwhile, Trump awaits sentencing after being convicted in New York in May of falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments made to a porn star. If Trump defeats Democratic candidate Kamala Harris in November, he is widely expected to order officials to drop all the remaining federal charges that he faces.",

        "text": "The Impact of AI on the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election\nAs we approach the 2024 United States presidential election, one technological force is poised to play a more significant role than ever before: artificial intelligence. While AI has been a factor in previous election cycles, its rapid advancement and widespread adoption are set to transform multiple aspects of the electoral process.\n\nFrom campaign strategies to voter engagement and even predictive analytics, AI\u2019s influence is\u2014and will continue to be\u2014pervasive, altering how candidates connect with voters and how voters perceive the political arena. Keep reading to find out what we think are the most impactful ways AI will affect this year\u2019s U.S. presidential election, both positively and negatively.\n\nCampaign Strategies & Voter Engagement\n\nAI has become an indispensable tool for political campaigns. With the ability to analyze vast amounts of data, AI helps campaigns target specific voter demographics with unprecedented precision. Machine learning algorithms process data from social media, voter registration databases, and consumer behavior to identify trends, preferences, and concerns among different voter groups. This enables campaigns to tailor their messaging, ensuring that they resonate with their audience on a more personal level.\n\nFor instance, AI-driven sentiment analysis tools allow campaigns to gauge public opinion in real-time. By monitoring social media platforms, these tools can identify shifts in voter sentiment and adjust messaging strategies accordingly. This dynamic approach ensures that campaigns remain relevant and responsive, a critical factor in a fast-paced election cycle.\n\nWhen it comes to voter engagement, AI\u2019s impact is equally profound. Chatbots and virtual assistants powered by AI are increasingly used by campaigns to interact with voters, answer their questions, and even facilitate voter registration. While these tools aren\u2019t always the most reliable and should be used with a bit of caution, they provide a more personalized experience, making it easier for voters to get the information they need and feel connected to the campaign.\n\nMisinformation & Deepfakes\n\nPerhaps the most concerning impact of AI on the 2024 election is its potential to generate and spread misinformation at scale. Deepfake technology, which uses AI to manipulate audio and video to create realistic but false representations of candidates, poses a significant threat to the election\u2019s integrity. We will likely see an increase in fabricated content purporting to show candidates saying or doing things they never did.\n\nAI language models can also generate convincing fake news articles and social media posts at an alarming rate. This flood of AI-generated misinformation could make it increasingly difficult for voters to distinguish fact from fiction.\n\nContent Moderation & Fact-Checking\n\nOn the flip side, AI is also being employed to combat misinformation, which is a significant concern in the digital age. Social media platforms and news organizations are using AI-powered tools to detect and flag potentially false or misleading content. These systems can analyze text, images, and videos to identify patterns associated with disinformation campaigns.\n\nHowever, the effectiveness of these tools remains to be seen, especially given the sophistication of modern AI-generated content. There\u2019s also the risk of false positives, where legitimate content is incorrectly flagged as misinformation.\n\nPredictive Analytics & Polling\n\nTraditional polling methods are being supplemented (and, in some cases, replaced) by AI models that analyze a wider range of data sources, including social media sentiment, economic indicators, and even search engine trends. These AI-driven predictions may prove more accurate than traditional polls, but they also raise questions about their influence on voter behavior and the potential for self-fulfilling prophecies.\n\nCybersecurity & Election Integrity\n\nAs election systems become increasingly digital, AI is playing a crucial role in protecting them from cyber threats. Machine learning algorithms can detect unusual patterns that might indicate hacking attempts or other security breaches. This is particularly important given concerns about foreign interference in U.S. elections.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that as defensive AI improves, so too does offensive AI used by malicious actors trying to compromise election systems.\n\nEthical Considerations\n\nThe rise of AI in the 2024 presidential election also raises important ethical questions. The use of AI to micro-target voters can lead to concerns about privacy and data security. Voters may not be fully aware of how much information is being collected about them and how it is being used to influence their decisions. This lack of transparency can erode trust in the electoral process.\n\nAdditionally, the automation of certain campaign functions through AI could potentially widen the gap between well-funded campaigns and those with fewer resources. While AI can make campaigns more efficient, it can also make it more difficult for underfunded candidates to compete on a level playing field.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nAs we move closer to Election Day, the impact of AI will only continue to grow. Campaigns will become more sophisticated in their use of AI, and voters will need to become more savvy in understanding how AI shapes their perceptions and choices. The intersection of AI and politics presents both opportunities and challenges, and how these are navigated will have far-reaching implications for the future of democracy in the United States.\n\nWhile AI offers powerful tools that can enhance the democratic process, it also presents significant challenges in terms of misinformation, privacy, and the potential for manipulation. The 2024 election may well be remembered as the first true \u201cAI election\u201d in U.S. history, setting precedents that will shape political campaigns for years to come.",

USPS will draw from its successes during the 2020 and 2022 elections to ensure the smooth handling of the nation\u2019s Election Mail \u2013 including ballots. This week, the Postal Service representatives also briefed House and Senate committee staff of its preparedness to deliver the nation\u2019s ballots.\n\n\u201cOur letter carriers and facilities teams across the country, the 640,000 women and men of the Postal Service, are fully focused on the critical mission of delivering the nation\u2019s election mail \u2013 just as we have done so excellently through this current primary season and as we have done in the past,\u201d said Postmaster General and CEO Louis DeJoy. \u201cWe are proud to do our part to help citizens\u2019 who choose to use the mail to vote to do so effectively.\u201d\n\nIn the 2020 general election, the Postal Service delivered 99.89 percent of ballots from voters to election officials within seven days. The 2022 midterm elections saw a similar level of on-time performance, with 99.93 percent of ballots delivered within the same timeframe. Post election analysis of the Postal Service\u2019s performance in the 2020 and 2022 elections can be found here and here. The Postal Service has the operational capacity to deliver the nation\u2019s ballots in the final weeks of the election. In 2020, ballots accounted for just .11% of the Postal Service\u2019s total mail volume.\n\nUSPS officials announced that the organization will once again implement proven extraordinary measures in the weeks immediately before and after the general election (Oct. 21 - Nov. 15, 2024) to enhance the timely delivery of mail-in ballots entered close to or on Election Day and/or the state\u2019s ballot return deadline. These efforts may include additional pickups, extra deliveries, and special sort plans on processing equipment to expedite and enhance ballot delivery.\n\nUSPS officials reiterated the organization\u2019s commitment to pausing the movement of mail and packages at facilities that were previously identified during its Mail Processing and Facility Reviews until early 2025. A complete list of impacted facilities can be found here.\n\nFurthermore, the Postal Service will use its discretion to avoid unnecessary optics or perception concerns, even when not related to new initiatives, and even when there is no real possibility that they will impact the Election Mail performance of the Postal Service. For example, management will suspend certain activities around collection management. Changes, such as replacement (unless due to vandalism) or removal of collection boxes, time changes to collections, or changes to eLocks will be suspended.\n\nAdrienne Marshall, director of Election and Government Mail Services, highlighted USPS\u2019s efforts to provide ongoing communications to election officials across the country, and expanded on her team\u2019s continuous efforts to prepare for elections:\n\n\u201cSince late last year, The Postal Service has met regularly with stakeholders across the election mail landscape, including State and Local election administrators, Postal Unions and Management Associations, Federal Agencies & Congress, the Mailing Industry and non-governmental organizations. We have good working relationships with these organizations, and we greatly appreciate their partnership,\u201d said Marshall. \u201cOur dedicated election preparedness team will remain closely engaged with state and local election officials and other stakeholders through November to ensure we are acting quickly to address any Election Mail-related issue that may arise in the delivery of a ballot to and from a voter.\u201d\n\nFinally, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) \u2013 the federal law enforcement and security arm of USPS \u2013 highlighted its plan to implement robust measures aimed at ensuring the secure delivery of all mail-in ballots. USPIS will leverage its extensive experience and resources to safeguard the integrity of the electoral process. This includes rigorous security protocols, continuous monitoring, and prompt response to any potential threats or incidents.\n\n\"We understand the critical role we play in the democratic process, and we are resolute in our efforts to secure the delivery of ballots and all Election Mail,\u201d said Brendan Donahue, Assistant Inspector in Charge. \u201cWe are committed to ensuring the safe and secure delivery of Election Mail to and from voters, the integrity of our nation\u2019s elections, and the protection of election officials from threatening and dangerous mail. We take a whole of agency and a whole of government approach to this critical mission, employing all our law enforcement resources and working in close coordination with our local, state, and federal law enforcement and security partners.\u201d\n\n###",

        "text": "2024 United States presidential election in Missouri\nThe 2024 United States presidential election in Missouri took place on Tuesday, November 5, 2024, as part of the 2024 United States elections in which all 50 states plus the District of Columbia will participate. Missouri voters will choose electors to represent them in the Electoral College via a popular vote. The state of Missouri has 10 electoral votes in the Electoral College, following reapportionment due to the 2020 United States census in which the state neither gained nor lost a seat.[1]\n\nAs he did in the previous two presidential elections, Republican Donald Trump easily won Missouri in 2024, this time by an 18.4% margin. Prior to the election, all major news organizations considered Missouri a state Trump would win, or a red state.[2] Formerly a bellwether state, Missouri has trended towards the Republican Party in recent years and since the late 2010s has been considered a GOP stronghold at both the federal and state levels.\n\nDemocrat Kamala Harris won the same jurisdictions that Joe Biden did in 2020, as did Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Obama in 2012: Jackson County, home to Kansas City; Boone County, home to Columbia; the independent city of St. Louis; and St. Louis County, which contains many of St. Louis's closest suburbs.\n\nPrimary elections [ edit ]\n\nRepublican caucuses [ edit ]\n\nThe Missouri Republican caucuses was held on March 2, 2024, alongside the Republican caucuses in Idaho and Michigan.\n\nMissouri Republican caucus, March 2, 2024 [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Candidate State delegates Percentage Actual delegate count Bound Unbound Total Donald Trump 924 100.00 54 0 54 Nikki Haley 0 0.00 0 0 0 David Stuckenberg 0 0.00 0 0 0 Total: 924 100 54 0 54\n\nDemocratic primary [ edit ]\n\nThe Missouri Democratic primary was held on March 23, 2024, alongside the Democratic primary in Louisiana.\n\nGeneral election [ edit ]\n\nPredictions [ edit ]\n\nPolling [ edit ]\n\nDonald Trump vs. Kamala Harris\n\nDonald Trump vs. Kamala Harris vs. Cornel West vs. Jill Stein vs. Chase Oliver\n\nPoll source Date(s)\n\nadministered Sample\n\nsize [ a ] Margin\n\nof error Donald\n\nTrump\n\nRepublican Kamala\n\nHarris\n\nDemocratic Cornel\n\nWest\n\nIndependent Jill\n\nStein\n\nGreen Chase\n\nOliver\n\nLibertarian Other /\n\nUndecided Remington Research Group (R)/Missouri Scout [ 24 ] October 28\u201329, 2024 721 (LV) \u00b1 3.6% 54% 40% \u2013 1% 1% 4%\n\nResults [ edit ]\n\n2024 United States presidential election in Missouri [ 37 ] Party Candidate Votes % Total votes 2,979,051 100.00\n\nAnalysis [ edit ]\n\nMissouri is a Midwestern state with heavy Southern cultural influence, having been a Southern border state and contested between the Union and Confederacy during the Civil War. A nigh-infallible bellwether state for the bulk of the 20th century well into the 2000s (backing the winner of all but one presidential election for a century, from 1904 to 2004, the exception being 1956 by just 0.22% and less than 4,000 votes), Missouri has voted Republican in every presidential election since 2000. It is widely understood to have lost its bellwether status when Democrat Barack Obama of neighboring Illinois failed to carry the state in either of his presidential victories, followed by Republican Donald Trump carrying it by more than 15% in all three of his election bids.\n\nAs half the state is located in the conservative Bible Belt, with the southern portion of the state being part of the Upland South, Missouri has drifted away from being a political bellwether towards the Republican Party in the 21st century and is now a strongly red state, with Republicans occupying every statewide office since 2023. Democratic strength in Missouri is nowadays largely limited to the Kansas City and St. Louis areas, as well as the college town of Columbia.\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nNotes [ edit ]\n\na b c d e f Key:\n\nA \u2013 all adults\n\nRV \u2013 registered voters\n\nLV \u2013 likely voters\n\nV \u2013 unclear a b \"Someone else\" with 1% ^ With voters who lean towards a given candidate ^ \"Other\" with 3%\n\nPartisan clients",

        "text": "Breaking down how state voting laws have changed since 2020\nWith regard to battleground states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona, and Georgia, how have voting laws changed or remained the same since 2020?\n\nThe story in Pennsylvania is the lack of change. We have divided government here, where the Democrats narrowly control the state House, Republicans control the state Senate, and there is a Democratic governor. There\u2019s a lot of needed reforms, but the two parties just can\u2019t get onboard to come up with a compromise bill that would put those reforms into place. For example, we can\u2019t process mail ballots here until Election Day, meaning that the counts on election night may take a little more time to come out in Pennsylvania.\n\nMichigan\u2019s an interesting one because it has had unified Democratic governance, so they were able to implement early in-person voting, another reform that I think would be great to have here in Pennsylvania.\n\nOn the flip side, you see some additional requirements going into place in some of the other battleground states. In Georgia they\u2019ve had a unified Republican government and in North Carolina enough Republican control of the state legislature to override a Democratic governor, so they\u2019ve put into place additional regulations on mail ballot voting. In North Carolina they enacted a stricter voter ID law, too.\n\nWhat role did disinformation about the integrity of the 2020 election play in state legislatures changing voting laws?\n\nYou can see in the debates over some of these new laws the effect of the \u2018Big Lie,\u2019 where Donald Trump and his supporters accused election officials of doing all these nefarious things with mail ballots. That was clearly still top-of-mind for many legislators when they were thinking about policy reforms coming out of 2020, and this will be the first presidential election where those go into force.\n\nIn a positive way, though, you didn\u2019t see some of the worst ideas take hold. There were proposals made in Georgia to end the policy in which anyone could request a mail ballot, for example, and that didn\u2019t end up going through. While there have been several reforms put into place across states that increase documentation requirements for absentee voting, I can\u2019t think of a single state that placed substantial additional restrictions on who can request mail ballots.\n\nWhat about the impact of the COVID pandemic? How did that shape changes to voting laws in different states, whether that meant expanding or restricting voting?\n\nA number of states, especially those that had elections happening in spring 2020, really had to expand their capacity to support mail balloting because a lot of people wanted to vote by mail in those elections. You do see some lingering effects of that as many of those states remain more capable to support mail voting than they were before 2020.\n\nWe\u2019re not going to see anywhere near the rate of mail balloting that we saw in 2020, but we will see more people using mail ballots than used them in, say, 2016. Part of that is these states that expanded their capacity to support mail balloting, but also there are a number of states that have continued to move toward all mail ballot elections. Oregon and Washington have been doing this for some time now, but, especially out in the western United States, we\u2019re seeing more and more states send people mail ballots as the default and Election Day voting is the unusual thing.\n\nHow have courts struck down different laws? What has already been resolved, and what\u2019s still in the courts now in different states?\n\nThe one that I\u2019m aware of that\u2019s potentially looming before the U.S. Supreme Court is Arizona\u2019s proof-of-citizenship law to get registered. States have a lot of leeway about what requirements they might put in place to verify the identity of people who want to register to vote, but there\u2019s also something called the federal voter registration form that states are mandated to accept under the National Voter Registration Act. Currently, Arizona has to accept the national voter registration form even if it doesn\u2019t contain all the details that it wants to document someone\u2019s citizenship status. There\u2019s an appeal before the U.S. Supreme Court that will probably have to be decided on before the election.\n\nAnother one that\u2019s top of mind for me is a lawsuit working through the Pennsylvania court system about the dates on the signatures next to the affidavits on the mail ballots, and there might be some court action on that still before the election.\n\nIn 2020, there was a plethora of court cases that the U.S. Supreme Court was ruling on into October. I think\u2014thankfully\u2014that\u2019s not where it appears we\u2019re at right now. There\u2019s lots of lawsuits happening, but I don\u2019t expect the U.S. Supreme Court will be weighing in on multiple cases even after mail ballots have gone out.\n\nIn the context of laws making it harder or easier to vote, how much of an impact do these kinds of laws have on voter turnout, compared to other factors?\n\nOn the margin, all these things matter, and they can really have big impacts on individual registrants\u2019 ability to vote or potentially people\u2019s ability to get registered in the first place. In the end, that\u2019s going to have some impact on voter turnout.\n\nI think there\u2019s this view that voter restrictions only affect Democrats, so that when people are disenfranchised by these laws, that\u2019s going to necessarily move the needle in the Republican direction. More often than not, these laws have a broader impact than people first realize. So, it might bring down overall turnout a little bit, but, in terms of the margin of the election, it may not have a huge effect because it\u2019s having an equal effect on people who vote for Democrats and people who vote for Republicans.\n\nWhat are you researching now, and what else are you focused on or watching ahead of the 2024 election?\n\nMy own research is largely on the types of things that we\u2019re talking about, be it how mail-ballot processes work or how voter-ID laws may or may not affect election outcomes. As I referenced earlier, this is the first presidential election that is being conducted since many new election administration policies were enacted following the 2020 election. After the election, I\u2019ll be going back and evaluating a bunch of these policies to see whether they had the effects that we expected. Is there evidence that turnout was affected? If so, can we detect any electoral consequences? Because we have so many new policies in place, there\u2019s so much opportunity to do evaluation coming out of this election.",

        "text": "Trump to vote against Florida abortion measure after backlash\nTrump to vote against Florida abortion measure after backlash\n\nGetty Images\n\nDonald Trump has said he will vote against a ballot measure in his home state of Florida that would protect abortion rights after facing backlash from conservative supporters. The former president's announcement came one day after an NBC News interview in which he appeared to support the measure - a statement that caused anti-abortion activists to openly criticise him. On Friday, Trump told Fox News that he still thinks Florida's ban on abortions after six weeks is too strict. However he said would still vote \"no\" on a measure that would amend the state's constitution to protect abortion rights.\n\n\"You need more time than six weeks,\" Trump said. \"I\u2019ve disagreed with that right from the early primaries when I heard about it.\" He then falsely alleged that Democrats in the US supported allowing abortions at any point during a pregnancy, which he used as his explanation for deciding to vote against the ballot measure in Florida as a voter in the state. Abortion laws vary widely in states across the US, but procedures after 21 weeks of pregnancy are rare and are often related to foetal anomalies or threats to the mother's life, according to the non-profit health organisation KFF. The Republican presidential nominee's decision to vote against the Florida abortion measure comes just one day after he was asked by NBC News how he would vote. \u201cI think the six week is too short,\u201d Trump said in the interview on Thursday. \u201cIt has to be more time. I told them that I want more weeks.\u201d \u201cI am going to be voting that we need more than six weeks,\u201d he said when pressed. His Democratic opponent, Vice-President Kamala Harris, quickly responded to Trump's announcement that he would support continuing Florida's abortion ban as indicative of him continuing his anti-abortion stance. \u201cDonald Trump just made his position on abortion very clear: He will vote to uphold an abortion ban so extreme it applies before many women even know they are pregnant,\" she said in a statement.\n\nTrump's comments open him to conservative criticism\n\nThursday's comments - in which Trump appeared to be open to voting in favour of the constitutional amendment - were heavily criticised by leaders in the anti-abortion movement, which plays a critical role in shaping conservative politics in the US. \u201cIf Donald Trump loses, today is the day he lost,\u201d conservative pundit Erick Erickson wrote on X, formerly Twitter. \u201cThe committed pro-life community could turn a blind eye, in part, to national abortion issues. But for Trump to weigh in on Florida as he did will be a bridge too far for too many.\u201d Albert Mohler Jr, president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, wrote on X that Trump's comments on reproductive rights, including on the six-week ban, \"seem almost calculated to alienate prolife voters\". \u201cPro-life Christian voters are going to have to think clearly, honestly, and soberly about our challenge in this election - starting at the top of the ticket,\" he said. After the Thursday NBC interview, the Trump campaign and his running mate JD Vance made public statements emphasising that the former president had not yet made up his mind on the ballot initiative. Mr Vance said the former president will \"make his own announcement on how he's going to vote\" on the Florida measure that will be based on \"his own judgement\". Trump has criticised Florida's six-week abortion ban before. Last September he said Florida Governor Ron DeSantis made a \"terrible mistake\" signing the ban into law. Mr DeSantis was challenging the former president in the Republican primary at the time.\n\nAbortion is a key issue in 2024 US election",

        "text": "Where is abortion illegal in the US?\nWhat are the abortion laws in US states?\n\nGetty Images\n\nAbortion rights are back in the spotlight in the US as the country heads into its presidential election between Democratic Vice-President Kamala Harris and her Republican opponent Donald Trump. The state of access in the US has been in flux for more than two years, since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade and rescinded the constitutional right to abortion. The June 2022 decision returned control over the procedure back to individual states. Access now varies depending on where you are. Some states have enacted total bans, while others protect the procedure throughout pregnancy. This patchwork map of rights will change again after the November election. Exactly how it changes will depend on who wins. Ms Harris has promised to \"restore\" abortion rights federally while Mr Trump has said recently he will leave the issue to states. Some states are also voting in referendums specifically on abortion. Here's a look at where things stand, and how they might change.\n\nWhat is Roe v Wade?\n\nIn 1973, in a case called Roe v Wade, the Supreme Court ruled that a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy was protected by the US Constitution up until the point of foetal viability, which is about 24 weeks. The landmark 7-2 decision established a framework to govern abortion based on a \"trimester\" system. She helped kill Roe v Wade - now she wants to end abortion\n\nA 19th Century law firing up anti-abortion push In the first three months, or trimester, of pregnancy, women were granted an almost absolute right to abortion. In the second trimester it allowed regulations to protect women's health. And in the third, it allowed states to ban abortions as long as exceptions were made for the health and life of the mother. This system remained in place for nearly 50 years, until the court overturned Roe and the nationwide constitutional right to abortion access. There were just over one million legal abortions performed in the US in 2023 - the first full calendar year since Roe was overturned - according to a study by the Guttmacher Institute, a pro-choice research group. This marked an 11% increase from 2020, and the first time since 2012 that more than 1 million abortions were recorded in the US.\n\nWhere is abortion banned in the US?\n\nAccess to legal abortion in the US now depends on where you are. As of August 2024, 17 states have outlawed nearly all abortions, banning the procedure at six weeks of pregnancy or earlier. Some have narrow exceptions for cases of rape, incest or the health of the mother. These states, including Texas, Florida, and Alabama, are under Republican control, with many clustered in the US South. Another eight states allow some access to the procedure. These states bar abortion some time between 12 and 23 weeks of pregnancy. She was denied an abortion in Texas - then she almost died The remaining 25 states, plus the District of Columbia, protect abortion. Nine of these states as well as DC do not restrict abortion based on gestational duration. This does not mean that anyone who wants an abortion at this stage can have one. On the contrary, abortions after 21 weeks pregnancy are rare and difficult to obtain - representing just 1% of all abortions in the US, according to the non-profit health organisation KFF. They are only performed by a small number of providers, KFF says, and are often related to medical concerns like foetal anomalies or threats to the life of the mother.\n\nWhat about abortion pills?\n\nMedication abortion is now the most common method of ending a pregnancy in the US and involves two drugs - mifepristone and misoprostol. The US Food and Drug Administration has approved the two-step regimen for use up until 10 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nGetty Images Abortion access in the US varies dramatically by state\n\nAbortion bans cover both surgical and medication abortion, meaning healthcare providers in these states are prohibited from prescribing abortion pills. But in some cases, abortion medication has been used to circumvent these bans. Some medical professionals in abortion-friendly states have begun prescribing the pills and sending them by mail to patients in restrictive states. In response, some states that oppose abortion are taking extra steps to curb the illegal use of abortion pills.\n\nHarris and Trump accuse each other of lying on abortion\n\nWill abortion matter in the US election?\n\nYes. Polls show the majority of Americans - around two-thirds - support legal access to abortion. And the number of Americans who say they would only vote for a candidate who shares their views on abortion has reached a record high of 32%. This broad support for abortion is expected to benefit Vice-President Kamala Harris's bid for the White House. In the time since Roe was overturned, the issue has handed Democrats a series of unexpected wins, including in the 2022 midterm elections and the Virginia state elections. And since taking over the reins from Joe Biden, Ms Harris has enthusiastically embraced reproductive rights as a key promise of her candidacy. She has promised to support legislation that would protect abortion rights nationally. New Florida six-week abortion ban will be felt beyond the state\n\nProject 2025: A wish list for a Trump presidency, explained\n\nSupreme Court rejects challenge to abortion drug mifepristone Former President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, campaigned in 2016 on appointing justices who would reverse Roe. He appointed three justices while in office, all of whom voted to overturn Roe. In recent months, Mr Trump has said he supports the authority of US states to govern abortion. Mr Trump has also faced scrutiny over the proposed abortion policies in Project 2025, a detailed blueprint for the next Republican administration. Mr Trump has disavowed the document, which was written by several alumni of the Trump White House. Legal experts say the policies outlined in Project 2025 amount to a de facto national abortion ban. Abortion itself will be also on the ballot in several states. So far, 11 states including Florida, Arizona, Maryland and Nebraska have confirmed referendums on abortion access for November.\n\nHear from Arizonans on both sides of the abortion debate\n\nHow does the US compare globally on abortion?",

        "text": "Kamala Harris details Biden's phone call about history-making decision to drop out of 2024 race\nIn her first interview since becoming the Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday shared that she learned President Biden was ending his reelection bid when he called her personally to inform her.\n\nIn her sit-down interview alongside her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Harris told CNN's Dana Bash that on July 21 she received a phone call from Mr. Biden while she was with her family.\n\nThat same day Mr. Biden posted a letter to social media announcing his shocking decision to end his campaign.\n\n\"I'll give you a little too much information,\" Harris said. \"My family was staying with us, including my baby nieces, and we had just had pancakes.\"\n\nThe family was \"sitting down to do a puzzle, and the phone rang and it was Joe Biden, and he told me what he had decided to do,\" Harris said. \"And I asked him, 'Are you sure?' And he said, 'yes.' And that's how I learned about it.\"\n\nThe vice president did not directly answer a question about whether Mr. Biden offered his endorsement over the phone, or if she specifically asked for it.\n\n\"He was very clear that he was going to support me,\" Harris said.\n\nIn his July 21 letter, Mr. Biden did not immediately endorse Harris, but instead did so in a separate social media post shortly after. It was with that endorsement that Harris was very quickly able to put together a coalition of support, in the process discouraging other potential candidates and halting any chance of an open Democratic primary.\n\nMr. Biden faced mounting pressure to drop out of the race from a growing chorus of political leaders within his own party in the weeks that followed his disastrous June 27 debate performance against former President Donald Trump. But Harris maintained unwavering public support for him, calling him \"our nominee\" and saying she was \"proud to be Joe Biden's running mate.\"\n\nWhen asked by Bash if she had regrets about how she defended Mr. Biden's capacity to serve another four years, she responded, \"No, not at all.\"\n\nHarris told CNN that while speaking with Mr. Biden by phone that day, her \"first thought was about him, to be honest,\" not about her own candidacy.\n\n\"I think history is going to show a bunch of things about Joe Biden's presidency,\" she said. \"I think history is going to show that in so many ways it was transformative.\"",

        "text": "A Catholic Approach to Voting in the 2024 Election\nBefore voting, put on the \u2018mind of Christ\u2019\n\nChrist calls each person to be a light in the world. As the general election approaches this fall, Catholics can be such a light by allowing the truths of the faith to inform their voting decisions.\n\nIt may be challenging for some to view the election with this mindset, as reflexive support for a particular party and the ongoing level of disappointment with the integrity and suitability of some candidates linger.\n\nStill, representative democracy in the United States requires public officials to be responsive to the will of voters, who have the collective ability to influence candidates and issues through choices made at the ballot.\n\nCatholics can be a light to the nation and this state by allowing the faith to inform their voting decisions.\n\nIn short, Catholics have an important role to play each election, including this year, to improve the moral fabric of the state and the nation.\n\nIn addition to selecting a presidential candidate, Michigan voters this year will fill one of the state\u2019s two U.S. Senate seats. Other significant races include Michigan\u2019s 14 congressional districts, all 110 seats in the state House of Representatives, and two justices of the Michigan Supreme Court. Voters should also remember the importance of local races and issues that impact counties, municipalities, and school districts.\n\nVoting is sometimes described as a civic duty. Yet, Pope Francis has said that each person also has a \u201cvocation as citizen,\u201d1 and so voting also takes on a moral dimension for Catholics.",

        "text": "Key takeaways from first Harris and Walz interview\nKey takeaways from first Harris and Walz interview\n\nWatch key moments from Harris and Walz's CNN interview\n\nUS Vice-President Kamala Harris has defended changing her mind on key issues in her first interview since entering the presidential race. The Democratic nominee was pressed on why her policies on immigration and climate have become more moderate since she ran for president in 2019. \"I think the most important and most significant aspect of my policy perspective and decisions is my values have not changed,\" she told CNN's Dana Bash. She also vowed to \"turn the page\" on the divisive rhetoric of the Trump era, in the joint interview with her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz.\n\nHer Republican opponent Donald Trump described the interview as \"BORING!!!\" on Truth Social when it concluded, and described Ms Harris as a fraud. The vice-president was forced to defend the White House's economic track record, as inflation and high cost-of-living prices continue to hurt Americans. When asked why she hadn't already implemented her ideas to tackle economic hardship she said they had done a lot of good work already but there was more to do. Polls suggest that voters would prefer Trump's handling of the economy. Here are the key takeaways from the interview. Fact-checking Harris's first interview\n\nWhere Kamala Harris stands on 10 key issues\n\nHarris defends shifts on fracking, climate and border\n\nPressed on her move from liberal to more moderate policy positions, she said her values were consistent, pointing to her commitment to tackling climate change as an example. Asked about her reversal on banning fracking, a technique for recovering gas and oil from shale rock, she said she was confident US climate targets could be met without a ban. The main Republican line of attack has been to cast Ms Harris as an extremist, pointing to her 2019 statements as evidence. Back then, she also advocated for the closure of immigration detention centres and the decriminalisation of illegal crossings. She takes a stronger line on the border now, referring to her time \"prosecuting transnational, criminal organisations\" as California attorney general. Earlier this year, she supported a bipartisan border security bill that would have included hundreds of millions of dollars for more wall construction. Trump pressured Republicans in Congress to kill the deal, which Ms Harris said in the CNN interview was a cynical political move.\n\nBiden's Gaza policy looks set to continue\n\nGetty Images Kamala Harris and Tim Walz arriving in Savannah, Georgia\n\nMs Harris also was asked about the war in Gaza, and re-iterated the White House's position that both Israel and Hamas must \"get a deal done\" and that the Palestinians deserve to have their own country neighbouring Israel. \"This war must end, and we must get a deal that is about getting the hostages out,\" she said. While emphasising the importance of a deal, she offered no specifics on how it would be achieved. She would not commit to an arms embargo on Israel, as some on her party's left flank have demanded.\n\nHarris would appoint a Republican in her Cabinet\n\nTo explain her moderated immigration view, the Democratic nominee told CNN that her travels across the country as vice-president had made her believe in building consensus. Expanding on that, she said she would include a Republican in her presidential cabinet. She said it would fulfill her promise to be a president \u201cfor all Americans\u201d. \"I have spent my career inviting diversity of opinion. I think it\u2019s important to have people at the table when some of the most important decisions are being made that have different views.\"\n\nShe refused to engage with Trump race comments\n\nCNN's Dana Bash asked Ms Harris, born to immigrant parents from Jamaica and India, about recent comments by Trump in which he suggested she assumed a black identity in later life for political purposes. The comments caused an outrage but the vice-president had not weighed in. This time she gave a very short answer. \"Same old, tired playbook. Next question, please.\" When asked later in the interview about the historic nature of her candidacy, she said she believed she was the best person to be president for for all Americans, regardless of race and gender. The many identities of the first female vice-president\n\nA 1986 snapshot of student Kamala Harris\n\nWalz says 'passion' led to misstatements\n\nMr Walz was asked about misleading statements he has made about his military service and his personal struggle to have children. Ms Bash asked him to clarify a comment he made in which he said he \"carried\" an assault rifle in \"war\". The campaign has clarified that Mr Walz was never in a war zone. The governor said he wore \"his emotions on his sleeve\" and was \"speaking passionately\" about the subject of gun crime in schools when he made the inaccurate statement. That \"passion\" also extended to his incorrect assertion that his wife had received in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatments - which have become a political lightning rod in the US debate over abortion access - to conceive their children. She received intrauterine insemination, not IVF. \"I spoke about our infertility issues \u2018cause it\u2019s hell, and families know this,\" he said on CNN.\n\nBiden called Harris to tell her the news\n\nMs Harris described the moment that President Biden called her to share that he had decided to end his re-election bid in July. She said her family was visiting her when she received the phone call. They had just eaten pancakes and bacon and were working on a puzzle. \"My first thought was not about me, to be honest with you, my first thought was about him,\" Ms Harris said when asked whether she asked for his endorsement. The vice-president also maintained that the president could have served again. \"He is so smart, and I have spent hours upon hours with him being in the Oval Office and in the situation room. He has the intelligence, the commitment and judgment and disposition that I think the American people rightly deserve in their president.\" She said Trump, by contrast, had none of those qualities.\n\nMore on the US election",

        "text": "Harris and Trump have competing tax plans. Here's how your paycheck would change under both.\nPresidential candidates commonly trot out new tax proposals as part of their campaign platforms, often pledging to help ease the financial burden on taxpayers. This year, the plans emerging from rivals Kamala Harris and Donald Trump could affect voters' paychecks in very different ways.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump would seek to extend the tax cuts enacted through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, his signature 2017 legislation that reduced taxes for most Americans, although research has shown the top earners received the biggest benefits. He's also proposing to eliminate taxes on tips and on Social Security income, while also lowering the corporate tax rate.\n\nVice President Harris has proposed introducing more generous tax benefits for families, as well as hiking the corporate tax rate to help offset spending from bigger tax credits.\n\nThe two proposals reflect different views of how best to support U.S. families and fuel economic growth. On the one hand, Trump's plan would provide tax cuts for all income groups, but the biggest winners would be higher-income Americans. The greatest benefits under Harris' plan would go to the lowest-income Americans, while she would up the taxes of the top-earning households.\n\n\"It's true that Trump looks like he's winner for everybody, but he'll provide much bigger giveaways to the top 1% and top 0.1%, whereas Harris will be negative for these people,\" said Kent Smetters, faculty director of the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a group within the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School that analyzes the budgetary impact of government policies.\n\nUltimately, both plans would come with significant price tags, although the combination of Trump's tax cuts for corporations and individuals would prove more expensive, Penn Wharton forecast. It estimates that his proposal would add $5.8 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade, compared with $2 trillion for Harris' plan.\n\nIn an email, Republican National Committee spokesperson Anna Kelly said that Trump's tax policies will \"shrink deficits\" as well as \"lower long-term debt levels\" through cuts in federal spending, increasing energy production and deregulation.\n\nThe Harris-Walz campaign, meanwhile, is pointing to the Penn Wharton Budget Model's analysis as evidence that Trump would create a \"deficit bomb agenda.\"\n\n\"Donald Trump's campaign may want to mute Donald Trump on the debate stage, but they can't mute our strong economy and Trump's disastrous agenda that will explode the deficit, increase costs on the middle class by nearly $4,000 a year, and send our economy hurtling into a recession by mid-next year,\" Harris-Walz spokesman James Singer said in an email.\n\n\"Explosive\" deficit?\n\nAlthough Harris' tax proposal would potentially have a smaller impact on the nation's deficit than Trump, Smetters noted that both parties would ultimately add to the nation's growing fiscal burden.\n\nThe federal budget deficit in fiscal year 2024 is projected to hit $1.9 trillion, the Congressional Budget Office forecast in June. That represents a 27% increase from its prior February forecast, due partly to new funding provided to Ukraine, Israel and other countries.\n\nDeficits may seem abstract to many taxpayers, but at the simplest level they show the country is spending more than it's taking in through tax revenue. That, in turn, increases the national debt to finance the deficit. Many economists warn that comes with a cost, such as higher interest payments to service that growing debt.\n\n\"Essentially we're on this explosive path right now,\" Smetters said.\n\nAt some point, soaring U.S. debt could sow doubt in capital markets about the federal government's ability to either raise taxes or cut spending enough to avoid defaulting on that debt, he added.\n\n\"Neither candidate is being serious about addressing the big issue \u2014the house is burning down and the candidates are arguing over the furniture,\" Smetters said. \"They are just making things worse and harming the economy.\"",

        "text": "2024 United States presidential election in Alabama\nThe 2024 United States presidential election in Alabama took place on Tuesday, November 5, 2024, as part of the 2024 United States elections in which all 50 states plus the District of Columbia will participate. Alabama chose electors to represent them in the Electoral College via a popular vote. The state of Alabama has nine electoral votes in the Electoral College, following reapportionment due to the 2020 United States census in which the state neither gained nor lost a seat.[1]\n\nA Southern state in the heart of the Bible Belt, no Democrat has won Alabama's electoral votes since Jimmy Carter of neighboring Georgia, in 1976, nor has it been contested at the presidential level since 1996, when Bill Clinton lost the state by 7 points.\n\nIncumbent Democratic President Joe Biden initially ran for re-election and became the party's presumptive nominee.[2] However, following what was widely viewed as a poor performance in the June 2024 presidential debate and amid increasing age and health concerns from within his party, he withdrew from the race on July 21 and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, who launched her presidential campaign the same day.[3] Biden's withdrawal from the race makes him the first eligible president not to stand for re-election since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968.\n\nFormer President and Republican nominee Donald Trump ran for re-election to a second non-consecutive term after losing in 2020.[4] Independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. gathered the required signatures to be on the ballot. Despite that, he dropped out of the race and endorsed Trump. However, his name stayed on the Alabama ballot.[5]\n\nAlabama voted for Trump by a comfortable margin in the election, with him winning the state by 30.5%.[6] This was the largest Republican win in the state since 1972.\n\nTrump was able to increase his support and gain ground in every county. Trump flipped majority-Black Marengo County into the Republican column for the first time in a presidential race since George W. Bush in 2004.\n\nBackground [ edit ]\n\nIn August 2024, Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen announced a process for purging 3,251 registered Alabama voters and referred them to the state attorney general\u2019s office for criminal prosecution.[7][8] In September 2024, the Department of Justice sued Alabama for violating the National Voter Registration Act.[9][10] In October 2024, district judge Anna Manasco ruled in favor of the Department of Justice, ordering the state to restore the voter registrations.[11][12] Alabama secretary of state\u2019s chief of staff Clay Helms testified that 2,000 of the purged voters were legally registered citizens.[12]\n\nPrimary elections [ edit ]\n\nDemocratic primary [ edit ]\n\nThe Alabama Democratic primary was held on Super Tuesday, March 5, 2024.\n\nAlabama Democratic primary, March 5, 2024 [ 13 ] Candidate Votes Percentage Actual delegate count Pledged Unpledged Total Joe Biden (incumbent) 168,080 89.50% 52 52 Uncommitted 11,283 6.01% 0 0 Dean Phillips 8,442 4.50% 0 0 Total: 187,805 100.00% 52 7 59\n\n\n\n\n\nRepublican primary [ edit ]\n\nThe Alabama Republican primary was held on Super Tuesday, March 5, 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral election [ edit ]\n\nOn April 9, 2024, Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen informed the Democratic National Committee that state law would not permit certification in time to include President Biden on the November ballot, as the 2024 Democratic National Convention (DNC) was to take place days after the state deadline of August 15.[16] The following month, legislation was approved extending the deadline to August 23, one day after the conclusion of the DNC, allowing Biden to appear on the ballot.[17]\n\nIn early August, after Vice President Kamala Harris replaced Biden in the race, Democrats held a virtual convention to nominate Harris, a process then formalized at the DNC convention. The day after the convention's conclusion, the Alabama Democratic Party filed paperwork to ensure Harris's inclusion on the Alabama ballot in November.[18]\n\nEarly voting [ edit ]\n\nA study by the Center for Election Innovation & Research in July 2024 found that Alabama is one of only three remaining states (along with Mississippi and New Hampshire) to offer no early in-person voting option for the 2024 general election. The state also requires an eligible reason to vote by mail.[19]\n\nPredictions [ edit ]\n\nPolling [ edit ]\n\nResults [ edit ]\n\n\n\nLegend Republican \u2014 +0-2.5%\n\nRepublican \u2014 +2.5-5%\n\nRepublican \u2014 +5-7.5%\n\nRepublican \u2014 +7.5-10%\n\nRepublican \u2014 +10-12.5% Swing by county\n\nLegend Democratic Hold Republican Hold Gain from Democratic County flips\n\n2024 United States presidential election in Alabama [ 33 ] Party Candidate Votes % Total votes 2,257,052 100.00%\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nNotes [ edit ]\n\na b c Key:\n\nA \u2013 all adults\n\nRV \u2013 registered voters\n\nLV \u2013 likely voters\n\nV \u2013 unclear ^ \"Another candidate\" with 5% ^ \"Another candidate\" with 4% a b Listed on the ballot without party affiliation. ^ Replacement for Butch Ware , Stein's vice presidential nominee.\n\nPartisan clients",

        "text": "Is US economy better now than under Trump?\nIs US economy better or worse now than under Trump?\n\nBBC\n\nIt has been a recurrent theme of this US presidential campaign - has the US economy performed better under Joe Biden or Donald Trump? \u201cBy many indicators our economy is the strongest in the world,\u201d Democratic Vice-President Kamala Harris has claimed. Trump, the Republican nominee and former president, says he created the \"greatest economy in the history of our country\", and the Biden-Harris administration has ruined it. We have looked at some key indicators to compare economic performance under the two presidencies.\n\nUS economic growth\n\nAlthough the impact of Covid has made comparison difficult, both presidents can count some notable economic successes despite wages struggling to keep up with price increases in recent years. First, let's look at economic growth using Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - the value of all goods and services in the US economy. There was a dramatic collapse in this figure during Covid as many businesses shut. Following the pandemic, the economy bounced back strongly under Trump and recovered better than many other western countries. This has continued under Mr Biden, with the US producing the strongest pandemic recovery within the G7 as measured by GDP.\n\nBut over Trump's four years in office, it was not the greatest economy in US history, as he likes to claim. Between January 2017 and January 2021, average annual growth rate was 2.3%. This period includes the slowdown and recovery of the economy as a result of the Covid pandemic. Under the Biden administration so far, this figure is 2.2% - so almost the same. There have been periods in the past when GDP growth was significantly higher than the average under both Trump and Biden, such as in the 1970s.\n\nInflation\n\nThe rate at which prices are rising has been a big issue in the campaign. Prices rose significantly during the first two years under Mr Biden - hitting a peak of 9.1% in June 2022. Trump has said the US has experienced \u201cthe worst inflation we've ever had\u201d. But that's not true - inflation was last above 9% in 1981, and it has been much higher than that at several other points in US history. Inflation has now fallen to around 3% - but it remains higher than when Trump left office.\n\nGrocery prices, for example, increased by 13.5% over the year ending in August 2022. This was the peak under the Biden administration, and prices have stabilised somewhat since, with the cost of groceries rising by 1.1% from July 2023 to July this year. The recent trend is comparable with many other Western countries which experienced high inflation rates in 2021 and 2022, as global supply chain issues driven by Covid and the war in Ukraine contributed to rising prices. But some economists say Mr Biden\u2019s $1.9tn (\u00a31.5tn) American Rescue Plan, which passed in 2021, was also a factor - as the injection of cash into the economy led to prices rising further.\n\nEmployment\n\nThe Biden administration has repeatedly pointed to strong job growth as a major achievement. Before big job losses in 2020 due to Covid, in the first three years of Trump's presidency almost 6.7 million jobs were added, according to data for non-farm jobs (which covers about 80% of workers in the labour force). There's been an increase of almost 16 million jobs since the Biden administration took over in January 2021.\n\nMr Biden claims this is the \u201cfastest job growth at any point of any president in all of American history\u201d. That\u2019s correct - if you look at the available data since records began in 1939. But his administration has benefited from a sharp rebound in economic activity as the country emerged from pandemic lockdowns. \u201cMany of the jobs would have come back if Trump had won in 2020 - but the American Rescue Plan played a major role in the speed and aggressiveness of the labour market recovery,\u201d says Professor Mark Strain, an economist at Georgetown University. This spending plan passed under the Biden administration in 2021 was designed to help stimulate the economy following the pandemic. Weaker than expected job growth in July led to fears of a sudden downturn in the US economy and stock markets were hit as a result, but they've since stabilised.\n\nBoth administrations have pointed to low unemployment levels under their leadership. Prior to the pandemic, Mr Trump delivered an unemployment rate of 3.5%. As in many parts of the world, Covid lockdown measures led to soaring levels of unemployment in the US - but the unemployment levels had dropped back down to around 7% when Trump left office. Under the Biden administration unemployment continued to fall to a low of 3.4% in January 2023 - the lowest rate in more than 50 years - but it it has since ticked up to 4.3%.\n\nWages\n\nIn terms of wages, these did rise under Trump but at a similar rate to his predecessor Barack Obama, up until the pandemic hit. Workers\u2019 wages increased rapidly at the start of 2020 during the Covid pandemic - but the sudden uptick in wages was linked to lower paid workers being more likely to be laid off, which raised the average wage of people who were still employed. Under Mr Biden, average weekly earnings have grown, but they have struggled to keep up with the increase in prices caused by high levels of inflation. When adjusted for inflation, average weekly wages are less than when Mr Biden came into office.\n\nFinancial markets\n\nThe US stock market isn't necessarily a reflection of the broader economy, but many Americans have investments, so its performance holds some importance. The Dow Jones Index is a measure of the performance of 30 large companies listed on US stock exchanges.\n\nIt reached record highs during Trump\u2019s presidency, but crashed as markets reacted to the pandemic, wiping out all the gains made under Trump. However, the financial markets recovered to above pre-pandemic levels by the time Trump left office in January 2021. They have continued to grow under Mr Biden, and although there have been recent wobbles, they have reached record levels under his administration as well.\n\nGraphics by Tommy Lumby.",

The first ballots will go out within days\nA possible criminal sentence for Trump\n\nTrump is scheduled to be sentenced Sept. 18 in his hush money criminal case, though his lawyers have asked the judge to delay the proceeding until after Election Day. A decision is expected early this month.\n\nIn a letter to Judge Juan M. Merchan, Trump\u2019s lawyers suggested that holding the sentencing as scheduled, about seven weeks before Election Day, would amount to election interference. On Sept. 16, Merchan is expected to rule on Trump\u2019s request to overturn the guilty verdict and dismiss the case because of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s July presidential immunity ruling.\n\nTrump was convicted in May on 34 counts of falsifying business records to conceal a $130,000 hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels just before the 2016 presidential election. Falsifying business records is punishable by up to four years in prison. Other potential sentences include probation, a fine or a conditional discharge that would require Trump to stay out of trouble to avoid additional punishment.\n\nNext steps in Trump\u2019s other New York cases\n\nOn Friday, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will hear arguments in Trump\u2019s appeal of a jury\u2019s verdict last year ordering him to pay $5 million to writer E. Jean Carroll after it found him liable for sexually assaulting and defaming her. Trump also is appealing a verdict in a second trial in January in which a jury found him liable on additional defamation claims and ordered him to pay Carroll $83.3 million. Trump\u2019s lawyers have until Sept. 13 to file a brief in that appeal.\n\nOn Sept. 26, a New York appeals court will hear oral arguments in Trump\u2019s challenge of a nearly $500 million civil fraud judgment in state Attorney General Letitia James\u2019 lawsuit against him. The court typically rules about a month after arguments, meaning a decision could come before the November election. Trump\u2019s lawyers argue that a judge\u2019s Feb. 16 finding that the former president lied for years about his wealth as he built his real estate empire was \u201cerroneous\u201d and \u201cegregious.\u201d State lawyers responded in court papers this week that there\u2019s \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d to support the verdict.\n\nWhat about Trump\u2019s election and document cases?\n\nA state case in Georgia that charged Trump and 18 others in a wide-ranging scheme to overturn his 2020 loss in the state is stalled with no chance of going to trial before the election.\n\nFederal prosecutors have brought two criminal cases against Trump, but one was dismissed by a judge last month and the other is likely to be reshaped by the recent U.S. Supreme Court opinion that conferred broad immunity on former presidents for official acts they take in office.\n\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith has appealed the dismissal by U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon of an indictment charging Trump with hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and obstructing the FBI\u2019s efforts to get them back. But even if a federal appeals court reinstates the case and reverses the judge\u2019s ruling that Smith\u2019s appointment was unconstitutional, there\u2019s no chance of a trial taking place this year.\n\nIn light of the Supreme Court\u2019s immunity ruling, a federal judge in Washington is now tasked with deciding which allegations in a separate case charging Trump with plotting to overturn the 2020 election can remain part of the prosecution and which ones must be discarded. Deciding which acts are official and which are not is likely to be an arduous process.\n\nFights over voting and the election\n\nBefore the first ballots are even cast, both camps are gearing up to fight over voting.\n\nBattles over election rules have become a staple of American democracy, but they\u2019re expected to reach new heights this year. Trump installed his own leadership team at the Republican National Committee, including a director of election integrity who helped him try to overturn Biden\u2019s win in 2020. The RNC has filed a blizzard of lawsuits challenging voting rules and promises that more are on the way.\n\nDemocrats also are mobilizing and assembling a robust legal team. Among other things, they are objecting to GOP efforts to remove some inactive voters or noncitizens from voter rolls, arguing that legal voters will get swept up in the purges.\n\nRepublicans have particularly escalated their rhetoric over the specter of noncitizens voting, even though repeated investigations have shown it almost never happens. Some also are pushing to give local election boards the ability to refuse to certify election results.\n\nAll indications are these efforts are laying the groundwork for Trump to again claim the election was stolen from him if he loses and to try to overturn the will of the voters. But there\u2019s no way to know if that will happen until the ballots are cast.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Kate Brumback and Christina A.

Since the vote, his opposition alliance has published voting data online which it says shows he won the election by a huge margin, of more than 30%.\n\nIt is this data that has led to the issuance of the arrest warrant.\n\nHe is accused of \"serious crimes\" including the \"usurpation\" of public duties, document falsification, instigation of disobedience and system sabotage, according to the public prosecutor.\n\nMr Gonz\u00e1lez, who has been in hiding since shortly after the election, has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nThe European Union has said it will not recognise Mr Maduro as having won re-election in July without seeing detailed voting tallies.\n\nSeveral Latin American countries have also withheld their support, with Mr Maduro's former ally, President Lula of Brazil, among those calling for full transparency by the Venezuelan government.\n\nThe US has recognised Mr Gonz\u00e1lez as having won most votes, saying there is \"overwhelming\" evidence of Maduro\u2019s defeat.\n\nHowever, the government-controlled National Electoral Council declared President Maduro the winner, prompting major protests across Venezuela.\n\nThe government of President Maduro has detained more than 2,400 people since the election, creating what the UN has called \"a climate of fear\".\n\nNow, the possibility that Mr Gonz\u00e1lez may also be detained on charges of inciting public disorder and conspiracy has suddenly become far more likely.\n\nEarlier, the US Department of Justice seized a plane used by President Maduro, saying it was obtained in violation of US sanctions on Venezuela.\n\nIn response, President Maduro's government accused Washington of \u201cpiracy\u201d and of \u201cillegally imposing its will\u201d around the world.",

This is primarily due to European concerns about Donald Trump\u2019s chances of returning to the presidency.\n\nFirst, European leaders are concerned about a continued and possibly irreversible decline in democratic norms if Trump returns to the presidency. Europeans are worried not only about U.S. domestic politics\u2014the danger of authoritarianism spreading in the United States\u2014but also about the impact on the international order, which they believe could suffer an even more serious setback from a second Trump term. Many worry that a Trump return could embolden other populist-nationalist leaders in Europe and beyond, as was seen during his time in office his.\n\nSecond, Europeans are deeply concerned about the implications of another Trump presidency for their security. U.S. support is clearly still crucial for NATO and Ukraine. Without a clear commitment from the United States, NATO would lack the political leadership and the conventional and nuclear capabilities to defend Europe. Based on Trump\u2019s own statements, Europeans expect him to use NATO\u2019s Article 5 as leverage to ramp up military budgets even more than they have done in reaction to Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine. They also fear that he could use threats to withdraw from NATO to settle non-defense issues with the European Union\u2014such as trade deficits\u2014on his terms. Another cause for concern is Trump\u2019s stated interest in negotiating a deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Ukraine. There is little confidence among European leaders in Trump\u2019s willingness\u2014or ability\u2014to make negotiations with Putin on a cease-fire part of a comprehensive strategy with lasting benefits, let alone a peace plan that would fully protect Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty.\n\nThird, Europeans fear that another Trump presidency would be disastrous for transatlantic economic relations. Based on his statements and past actions, he is prepared to return to tariffs and other coercive economic measures against U.S. allies, including the European Union. Renewed tariffs on everything from steel and aluminum exports to autos could deal a blow to the economies of many member states. In addition, Trump could be expected to increase pressure on the European Union to follow his China policy and urge it to fully decouple EU economies from the Chinese.\n\nEuropeans are less anxious about a Kamala Harris presidency. Harris has stated her unwavering support for NATO and for Ukraine. She has also expressed support for international institutions and the need to cooperate on global challenges such as climate change. This is not to say that there would be no challenges for the European Union; Harris would also have high expectations of European nations. This would likely include greater support for Ukraine and increased defense spending within NATO. Harris also favors a robust economic policy toward China. She can be expected to seek European cooperation on a common approach to reining in Beijing\u2019s increasingly aggressive economic and foreign policies.",

        "text": "U.S. presidential election shifts into another gear, with focus primarily on 7 states\nAfter a summer of historic tumult in U.S. presidential politics, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump begin an eight-week sprint to election day neck-and-neck in most national polls.\n\nDemocrats have been buoyed by Harris's nomination, following Joe Biden's decision to abandon a second term in office following a disastrous performance in an atypically early June presidential debate against Trump.\n\nBut the party knows all too well that national results only tell so much. Democratic presidential candidates have earned more votes than Republican opponents in seven of the last eight presidential elections held since 1992, but only put a winner into the Oval Office on five of those occasions, due to electoral college system results.\n\nHarris and Trump will devote almost all of their remaining time and resources ahead of Nov. 5 to just seven states that are seen as the most impactful to getting to the 270-vote threshold in the electoral college, in addition to swing districts in Nebraska and Maine that each award single electoral college votes. Those seven states are: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin\n\nThe campaigns will spend hundreds of millions of dollars targeting voters who, in many cases, have just begun to pay attention to the election.\n\n\"Post Labour Day, when the bell rings, there is a battle for a slim universe of \u2014 you can call them anything you want: persuasion voters, swing voters, independent voters \u2014 and it's pretty small, and that's where each side gets a billion dollars,\" Democratic pollster John Anzalone said.\n\nWATCH l Canada can expect U.S. protectionism regardless of result, analyst says:\n\nTrump or Harris \u2014 can Canada make it work? | Canada Tonight Duration 6:23 Canada's ambassador to the U.S. said Tuesday the country will work well with whomever wins the U.S. November presidential election. Martin Patriquin, Quebec correspondent for The Logic, says the difference will be \u2018managing chaos.\u2019\n\nSeptember also promises to be eventful. Trump and Harris are set to meet on Sept. 10 in the lone scheduled presidential debate so far. That debate is in Philadelphia in the nation's premier swing state, Pennsylvania, which begins in-person absentee voting the following week. By the end of the month, early voting will be underway in at least four more states.\n\nAs well, Trump's sentencing for a criminal conviction for falsifying business records is set for Sept. 18 in New York, though the judge could decide to delay it at a hearing to take place two days earlier.\n\nDemocratic opportunities re-emerge after Biden exit\n\nIn replacing Biden as the party's nominee, Harris breathed new life into the Democrats' political prospects, especially across the Sun Belt states of Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina. All four states have significant numbers of African Americans and Latinos, traditionally Democratic constituencies who were down nationally on Biden but appear to have come home to rally behind Harris.\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham told The Associated Press he was worried about Georgia's shift since Biden departed the race.\n\n\"Trump was up five or six points, and all over the course of a month it's become much more competitive,\" said Graham.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden takes a photo with Democratic presidential nominee, Vice-President Kamala Harris, and others during a campaign stop in Pittsburgh on Monday. (Susan Walsh/The Associated Press)\n\nBut the Harris campaign put out a memo over the weekend casting itself as \"the clear underdogs\" in the contest, looking to mobilize supporters.\n\n\"There's not a scenario here that's easy,\" Harris senior adviser David Plouffe said in an interview. \"The pathway to beating Donald Trump, the pathway to 270 electoral votes for Kamala Harris, is exceedingly hard, but doable. And that's just a reality.\"\n\nJust over a month ago, Trump allies suggested Democratic-leaning states like Minnesota, Virginia or even New Jersey might be in play. Neither side believes that is still the case on Labour Day weekend.\n\nRepublican pollster Paul Schumaker, an adviser to North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, said even a slight uptick in the Black vote has the potential to give Harris the edge in North Carolina, pointing to Mecklenberg County, the home of the Charlotte metro area, but also fast-growing counties such as Durham and Wake.\n\n\"If Kamala Harris could get them to turn out at the rate of Republicans in rural North Carolina, game over for Republicans,\" Schumaker said of Black voters.\n\nWATCH | Wave of anti-Trump ads: Group of anti-Trump Republicans launches ad campaign in 5 swing states Duration 2:59 A group called Republican Voters against Trump is running TV and billboard ads in five key swing states, seeking to persuade people who have previously voted for Donald Trump to switch their vote to Kamala Harris or to stay home on election day.\n\nMoney pours into Pennsylvania\n\nAt the same time, Trump remains decidedly on offence in the Midwestern battlegrounds of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, which form the so-called Democratic \"blue wall\" that he narrowly carried in 2016 over Hillary Clinton and barely lost in 2020 to Biden..\n\n\"We feel pretty good about things. We feel energized. Our people are energized,\" said James Blair, the Trump campaign's political director. \"But there's certainly plenty of work to be done.\"\n\nRepublican presidential nominee Donald Trump listens as Pennsylvania Republican Senate candidate Dave McCormick speaks at a campaign event on Aug. 30 in Johnstown, Pa. (Alex Brandon/The Associated Press)\n\nA Trump victory in Pennsylvania alone would make it much more difficult for Harris to earn 270 electoral votes, and his campaign is investing more advertising dollars there than in any other state through election day.\n\nIn the fight to frame the election on the air and reach voters in person, Democrats currently have a decided advantage.\n\nHarris's team is on pace to outspend Trump's camp 2-to-1 in television advertising over the next two months. Her team, which includes her campaign and an allied super PAC, have more than $280 million US in television and radio reservations for the period between Tuesday and election day, according to the media tracking firm AdImpact. Trump's team, by contrast, has $133 million US reserved for the final stretch, although that number is expected to grow.\n\nBut Trump's side is actually narrowly outspending Harris's on the airwaves in Pennsylvania, where both sides are on pace to spend more than $146 million US between Tuesday and election day, according to AdImpact. The figure dwarfs that of any other state, with Georgia next on the list with $80 million US in ad spending.\n\nIn the other five battleground states, Harris so far has the airwaves largely to herself.\n\nDemocrats are also hoping the enthusiasm behind her bid can prevent heavy losses in Congress. The party hopes to retake control of the House, as all 435 seats are up for a vote in that chamber, while 34 of 100 Senate states are in play for both parties.",

        "text": "Teamsters president says he hasn't endorsed Kamala Harris yet because \"you don't hire someone unless you give them an interview\"\nTeamsters president says union hasn't backed Harris yet because they are waiting for a meeting\n\nSean O'Brien, president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said Sunday he hasn't endorsed in the 2024 presidential race yet because he hasn't yet met with Vice President Kamala Harris, and \"you don't hire someone unless you give them an interview.\"\n\nThe International Brotherhood of Teamsters is one of the 10 largest unions in the United States with 1.3 million members and the only in the group of 10 that hasn't endorsed Harris, the Democratic nominee.\n\nThe Teamsters have historically endorsed a presidential candidate after both the Democratic and Republican conventions, but O'Brien said this election cycle is different. O'Brien already turned heads when he spoke at the Republican National Convention in July, the first leader in the organization's 121-year history to address the RNC.\n\n\"This time, under our leadership, we brought every single candidate to the table in front of our rank and file members and our general executive board, and we're waiting on Vice President Harris to commit to come meet with us,\" O'Brien said on \"Face the Nation.\"\n\nO'Brien said the Teamsters, unlike other major unions, have a split in political affiliation, which heightens the need for sit-down conversations with all presidential candidates. Teamsters met with Harris' GOP opponent, former President Donald Trump, as well President Biden earlier this year.\n\n\"Half of our members are Republicans, half of our members are Democrats. So we have to serve all of our membership equally,\" O'Brien said. \"And you know, this is our opportunity to ask her (Harris) about Teamster specific issues and also labor issues. So until we have that meeting, you know, obviously we will wait to make that determination.\"\n\nThe Harris-Walz campaign said before the DNC that Harris has agreed to a roundtable with the Teamsters.\n\nTeamsters president Sean O'Brien on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" Sept. 1, 2024. CBS News\n\n\"VP has received and gladly accepted an invitation by IBT leadership to participate in a candidate roundtable to discuss her record of fighting for Teamsters and their families and to highlight her vision for the future. The campaign looks forward to scheduling the roundtable in the near future,\" a campaign spokesperson said.\n\nAt the RNC in July, O'Brien delivered an anti- big business keynote speech.\n\nO'Brien's speech displayed the visible shift within the GOP since Trump's election in 2016, moving from a corporate, Wall Street-focused message toward a more worker-friendly tone.\n\n\"Today, the Teamsters are here to say we are not beholden to anyone or any party,\" O'Brien said during the July speech. \"We will create an agenda and work with a bipartisan coalition, ready to accomplish something real for the American worker. And I don't care about getting criticized.\"\n\nO'Brien said on \"Face the Nation\" that he asked to speak at both the Republican and Democratic National Conventions, but that only the RNC responded. United Auto Workers president Shawn Fain addressed the DNC in August, as well as several other union leaders.\n\n\"Whenever I get an opportunity to highlight the American worker, especially the Teamster worker, I'm going to take any and all venue,\" O'Brien said Sunday. \"We asked both conventions, respectively, at the same time, and the Republican National Convention immediately responded to us\u2026 I was hopeful that the Democrats would do the same, but they didn't.\"\n\nWhen asked if he appeared at the RNC because he feels Trump has been more pro-labor than past Republican nominees, O'Brien said, \"no, not at all,\" although Trump gave O'Brien a standing ovation and O'Brien called him a \"tough SOB\" in his speech. O'Brien on Sunday insisted the purpose of the speech was to highlight American workers and not to signal an endorsement in any one direction.\n\n\"It wasn't an endorsement for any and all Republicans. It was strictly a message about how important and how valuable we are, and to let the people know that fight us every day that we're not going away,\" O'Brien said.",

The Kremlin has increasingly adapted its efforts to hide its involvement by developing a vast ecosystem of Russian proxy websites, fake online personas, and front organizations that give the false appearance of being independent news sources unconnected to the Russian state.\u00a0Today\u2019s designations follow prior OFAC actions that have highlighted and disrupted Russia\u2019s global malign influence campaigns, including Kremlin-directed malign influence efforts,\u00a0interference in U.S. elections,\u00a0efforts to subvert democracy in Moldova,\u00a0destabilization activities in Ukraine, and\u00a0the operation of outlets controlled by Russian intelligence services,\u00a0among others.RT EXECUTIVES\u2019 and RaHDit Members\u2019 Russian Government Influence OperationsRT, formerly Russia Today, is a Russian state-funded news outlet that began broadcasting internationally in\u00a02005. In\u00a02017, RT registered as an agent of a foreign government in the United States. Beginning in early 2024, RT executives began an effort to covertly recruit unwitting American influencers. RT used a front company to disguise its own involvement or the involvement of the Russian government.\u00a0Margarita Simonovna Simonyan (Simonyan) is the Editor-in-Chief of RT and a central figure in Russian government malign influence efforts. She allowed the operations of a front company to occur under the cover of RT. Elizaveta Yuryevna Brodskaia (Brodskaia) is the Deputy Editor-in-Chief of RT, who has reported to Russian President Putin and other government officials. Anton Sergeyvich Anisimov (Anisimov) is an RT Deputy Editor-in-Chief, who conducts activities on behalf of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB). Andrey Vladimirovich Kiyashko (Kiyashko) is the Deputy Director of the RT English-Language Information Broadcasting and is responsible for updating Russian government officials and providing an overview of RT\u2019s operations. Konstantin Kalashnikov (Kalashnikov) is RT\u2019s Digital Media Projects Manager, who, in early\u00a02022, worked with Kiyashko. In mid\u20112023, Brodskaia and Kiyashko implemented a large-scale influence operation for RT on U.S. social media with the intent of obscuring RT\u2019s connection to the content meant to influence online audiences. Elena Mikhaylovna Afanasyeva\u00a0(Afanasyeva) is an employee of RT\u2019s Digital Media Projects Department and reports to Kalashnikov. Starting in early\u00a02024, Afanasyeva covertly interacted with prominent U.S. social media influencers under the cover of a fake persona, purporting to be an employee at a U.S. company to obscure RT\u2019s and the Russian government's involvement.The pro-Kremlin hacktivist group RaHDit is composed of active and former Russian intelligence officers. Aleksey Alekseyevich Garashchenko (Garashchenko) is the head of RaHDit and was an FSB officer at the time he started leading the group. Garashchenko directly interacts with members of the Russian intelligence and security services, members of the Russian Presidential Administration, and employees from RT. Anastasia Igorevna Yermoshkina (Yermoshkina) is an affiliate of Garashchenko. Aleksandr Vitalyevich Nezhentsev (Nezhentsev) works with Garashchenko and is an administrator and developer of cyber tools used by the FSB. Nezhentsev also leads a team focusing on developing new tools that can be used in the surveillance of information data files.\u00a0Today, OFAC designated Simonyan, Brodskaia, Anisimov, Kiyashko, Kalashnikov, Afanasyeva, Garashchenko, Yermoshkina, and Nezhentsev pursuant to E.O.\u00a014024 for being owned or controlled, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, the Government of the Russian Federation.\u00a0Doppelg\u00e4nger and RRN Russian Malign Influence OperationsAutonomous Non-Profit Organization (ANO) Dialog (ANO Dialog) is a Russian nonprofit organization founded in\u00a02019 by the Moscow city government that leverages AI technology in online Russian disinformation for use against election campaigns. ANO Dialog Regions (Dialog Regions) is ANO Dialog\u2019s subsidiary organization that is co-located at their Moscow headquarters and also has offices throughout Russia.\u00a0Vladimir Grigoryevich Tabak (Tabak) is the Director General of both ANO Dialog and Dialog Regions. He previously held several positions in the Russian Presidential Administration.\u00a0ANO Dialog is linked to Doppelg\u00e4nger\u2014a Russia-linked influence operation network identified in\u00a02022\u2014that used deep fake content to develop Russian disinformation campaigns. In fall\u00a02022, Tabak was expected to attend a meeting with senior Russian government officials. The meeting discussed the presumed success of the Doppelg\u00e4nger activity and provided feedback and guidance on future projects.In July\u00a02022, ANO Dialog and Tabak provided services to the Russian government, working on a project for the creation of fake online posts on popular social media accounts, including \u201cReliable Recent News\u201d (\u201cRRN\u201d) and \u201cWar on Fakes\u201d\u2014a Russian disinformation website publicly linked to the Doppelg\u00e4nger activity\u2014that would be composed of counterfeit documents, among other material, in order to elicit an emotional response from the audiences of these accounts. An ANO Dialog advisor purchased RRN\u2019s new domain, \u201crrn.world\u201d in order to avoid using the former domain, \u201crrussianews.com,\u201d which would have maintained a connection to Russia. Tabak also coordinated with ANO Dialog and the Russian government on the payment of services for an RRN-affiliate translator.\u00a0In late fall\u00a02023, ANO Dialog personnel identified U.S., UK, and other public figures as potential targets for deepfake projects. Because of this, the EU sanctioned ANO\u00a0Dialog for its role in the disinformation network and specifically as the owner and operator of the \u201cWar on Fakes\u201d website. In May\u00a02024, Tabak and several Dialog Regions officials coordinated with Russian government officials regarding the creation of bot accounts on popular social media messaging platforms for use in a misinformation campaign regarding voting locations in the U.S.\u00a02024 election.\u00a0Today, OFAC designated ANO Dialog pursuant to E.O.\u00a014024 for being owned or controlled by, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, the Government of the Russian Federation; Dialog Regions pursuant to E.O.\u00a014024 for being owned or controlled by, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, ANO Dialog; and Tabak pursuant to E.O.\u00a014024 for being owned or controlled by, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, the Government of the Russian Federation and for being a leader, official, senior executive officer, or member of the board of directors of ANO Dialog and Dialog Regions, persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O.\u00a014024.\u00a0Also today, the Federal Bureau of Investigation announced the seizure of domains associated with RRN/ANO Dialog and Social Design Agency (SDA)\u2014which OFAC had previously designated pursuant to E.O.\u00a014024 for its activities on behalf of the Russian government\u2014that have been used in furtherance of the Russian Doppelg\u00e4nger disinformation efforts targeting the United States and Europe.\u00a0SANCTIONS IMPLICATIONSAs a result of today\u2019s action, all property and interests in property of the designated persons described above that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked and must be reported to OFAC. In addition, any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, individually or in the aggregate, 50 percent or more by one or more blocked persons are also blocked. Unless authorized by a general or specific license issued by OFAC, or exempt, OFAC\u2019s regulations generally prohibit all transactions by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in property of designated or otherwise blocked persons.\u00a0In addition, financial institutions and other persons that engage in certain transactions or activities with the sanctioned persons may expose themselves to sanctions or be subject to an enforcement action. The prohibitions include the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any designated person, or the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.\u00a0The power and integrity of OFAC sanctions derive not only from OFAC\u2019s ability to designate and add persons to the SDN List, but also from its willingness to remove persons from the SDN List consistent with the law. The ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish, but to bring about a positive change in behavior. For information concerning the process for seeking removal from an OFAC list, including the SDN List, please refer toOFAC\u2019s Frequently Asked Question 897 here.\u00a0For detailed information on the process to submit a request for removal from an OFAC sanctions list, please click here.Click here for more information on the individuals and entities designated today.\u00a0\u00a0###",

Nezhentsev also leads a team focusing on developing new tools that can be used in the surveillance of information data files.\n\nToday, OFAC designated Simonyan, Brodskaia, Anisimov, Kiyashko, Kalashnikov, Afanasyeva, Garashchenko, Yermoshkina, and Nezhentsev pursuant to E.O. 14024 for being owned or controlled, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, the Government of the Russian Federation.\n\nDoppelg\u00e4nger and RRN Russian Malign Influence Operations\n\nAutonomous Non-Profit Organization (ANO) Dialog (ANO Dialog) is a Russian nonprofit organization founded in 2019 by the Moscow city government that leverages AI technology in online Russian disinformation for use against election campaigns. ANO Dialog Regions (Dialog Regions) is ANO Dialog\u2019s subsidiary organization that is co-located at their Moscow headquarters and also has offices throughout Russia.\n\nVladimir Grigoryevich Tabak (Tabak) is the Director General of both ANO Dialog and Dialog Regions. He previously held several positions in the Russian Presidential Administration.\n\nANO Dialog is linked to Doppelg\u00e4nger\u2014a Russia-linked influence operation network identified in 2022\u2014that used deep fake content to develop Russian disinformation campaigns. In fall 2022, Tabak was expected to attend a meeting with senior Russian government officials. The meeting discussed the presumed success of the Doppelg\u00e4nger activity and provided feedback and guidance on future projects.\n\nIn July 2022, ANO Dialog and Tabak provided services to the Russian government, working on a project for the creation of fake online posts on popular social media accounts, including \u201cReliable Recent News\u201d (\u201cRRN\u201d) and \u201cWar on Fakes\u201d\u2014a Russian disinformation website publicly linked to the Doppelg\u00e4nger activity\u2014that would be composed of counterfeit documents, among other material, in order to elicit an emotional response from the audiences of these accounts. An ANO Dialog advisor purchased RRN\u2019s new domain, \u201crrn.world\u201d in order to avoid using the former domain, \u201crrussianews.com,\u201d which would have maintained a connection to Russia. Tabak also coordinated with ANO Dialog and the Russian government on the payment of services for an RRN-affiliate translator.\n\nIn late fall 2023, ANO Dialog personnel identified U.S., UK, and other public figures as potential targets for deepfake projects. Because of this, the EU sanctioned ANO Dialog for its role in the disinformation network and specifically as the owner and operator of the \u201cWar on Fakes\u201d website. In May 2024, Tabak and several Dialog Regions officials coordinated with Russian government officials regarding the creation of bot accounts on popular social media messaging platforms for use in a misinformation campaign regarding voting locations in the U.S. 2024 election.\n\nToday, OFAC designated ANO Dialog pursuant to E.O. 14024 for being owned or controlled by, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, the Government of the Russian Federation; Dialog Regions pursuant to E.O. 14024 for being owned or controlled by, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, ANO Dialog; and Tabak pursuant to E.O. 14024 for being owned or controlled by, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, the Government of the Russian Federation and for being a leader, official, senior executive officer, or member of the board of directors of ANO Dialog and Dialog Regions, persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14024.\n\nAlso today, the Federal Bureau of Investigation announced the seizure of domains associated with RRN/ANO Dialog and Social Design Agency (SDA)\u2014which OFAC had previously designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for its activities on behalf of the Russian government\u2014that have been used in furtherance of the Russian Doppelg\u00e4nger disinformation efforts targeting the United States and Europe.\n\nSANCTIONS IMPLICATIONS\n\nAs a result of today\u2019s action, all property and interests in property of the designated persons described above that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked and must be reported to OFAC. In addition, any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, individually or in the aggregate, 50 percent or more by one or more blocked persons are also blocked. Unless authorized by a general or specific license issued by OFAC, or exempt, OFAC\u2019s regulations generally prohibit all transactions by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in property of designated or otherwise blocked persons.\n\nIn addition, financial institutions and other persons that engage in certain transactions or activities with the sanctioned persons may expose themselves to sanctions or be subject to an enforcement action. The prohibitions include the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any designated person, or the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.\n\nThe power and integrity of OFAC sanctions derive not only from OFAC\u2019s ability to designate and add persons to the SDN List, but also from its willingness to remove persons from the SDN List consistent with the law. The ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish, but to bring about a positive change in behavior. For information concerning the process for seeking removal from an OFAC list, including the SDN List, please refer toOFAC\u2019s Frequently Asked Question 897 here. For detailed information on the process to submit a request for removal from an OFAC sanctions list, please click here.\n\nClick here for more information on the individuals and entities designated today.\n\n\n\n###",

The justice, state and treasury departments announced coordinated actions on Wednesday to \"aggressively counter\" the alleged operations. Attorney General Merrick Garland accused state broadcaster RT, formerly Russia Today, of paying a Tennessee firm $10m to \"create and distribute content to US audiences with hidden Russian government messaging\". RT boss Margarita Simonyan was one of 10 people sanctioned for alleged attempts to harm \"public trust in our institutions\". RT denied involvement.\n\nMr Garland said that Moscow wanted to secure a \"preferred outcome\" in the race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. White House national security spokesman John Kirby said that Russia's programme was aimed at \"reducing international support for Ukraine, bolstering pro-Russian policies and interests, and influencing voters here in the US\". The fake stories from Russia targeting US voters A Treasury official meanwhile said that RT and other Russian state media had engaged in a \"nefarious campaign to covertly recruit unwittingly American influencers in support of their malign activity\". The Biden administration's response so far includes: Charging two Moscow-based managers of RT - Kostiantyn Kalashnikov, 31, and Elena Afanasyeva, 27 - for paying content creators on US soil to \"pump pro-Russia propaganda and disinformation\" to US audiences;\n\nSanctioning two entities and 10 people including Simonyan, RT editor-in-chief, for \"activities that aim to deteriorate public trust in our institutions\";\n\nRestricting visas for employees of Kremlin-backed media outlets;\n\nSeizing 32 internet domain names used to \"covertly promote AI-generated false narratives\" targeting specific US demographics and regions on social media;\n\nDesignating Rossiya Segodnya and five of its subsidiaries (RIA Novosti, RT, TV-Novosti, Ruptly, and Sputnik) as \"foreign missions\", requiring them to report information about their personnel to the US government;\n\nOffering a $10m reward for information on hackers associated with the Russian group, Russian Angry Hackers Did It (RaHDit). Much of the Kremlin's disinformation effort is directed and funded by RT, Mr Kirby said. \"RT is no longer just a propaganda arm of the Kremlin,\" he said. \"It's being used to advance covert Russian influence actions.\" The state media outlet mocked the US government's accusations, saying in a statement to the BBC that \"2016 called and it wants its clich\u00e9s back\". \"Three things are certain in life: death, taxes and RT's interference in the US elections.\" The criminal indictments of Kalashnikov and Afanasyeva do not identify by name the Tennessee-based content creation company they used. But the court filing's description of \"a network of heterodox commentators that focus on Western political and cultural issues\" matches the self-description carried on the website of an outlet named Tenet Media. Tenet posts thousands of English-language videos on social media, and promotes well-known right-wing commentators Benny Johnson, Tim Pool and Dave Rubin as its \"talent\". Pool said on Twitter/X that he and other commentators had been \"deceived\" and were themselves victims. The company has been contacted for comment.",

        "text": "Reality Check: An insider\u2019s guide to how political polls work\nRMPBS: What went wrong in the Trump-Clinton election in 2016? Everyone predicted Hillary Clinton would win, but she didn\u2019t.\n\nAS: The polls had too many college-educated voters and the fault lines in the election were around education. By and large, college-educated voters were voting for Hillary, and voters without a college degree were voting for Trump.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat educational polarization was new \u2014 it\u2019s not something that we had seen to that degree prior to 2016. Before 2016, it didn\u2019t hugely matter if your sample was a little bit underrepresenting the non-college educated voter because the non-college educated voter was voting along similar lines as college-educated voters.\n\nRMPBS: What have pollsters learned since 2016?\n\nAS: Everyone doing this work is now aware of the importance of speaking with voters of different education levels. There has been a real broadening of ways to reach people. And a lot of that is the recognition that if you only have one way of reaching people \u2014 like calling people on the phone, which generally speaking tends to be college-educated voters \u2014 and those people are a little bit different from the rest of voters, your poll is going to be off.\n\nWe also started weighting responses in 2016 and we\u2019re doing more of that now. Weighting is basically slightly dialing up or slightly dialing down certain respondents based on their demographics in order to get more of a representative sample. Let's say I have one non-college-educated respondent in my sample and I need ten. I really shouldn't multiply that person by ten and say, \u201cGreat, I'm all set.\u201d I should go out and find six other seven other people and then multiply each of them by a small factor \u2014 like 1.5.\n\nRMPBS: Do conservative or liberal media outlets skew their polls in any way?\n\nAS: They really shouldn't be and generally they're not. If a Fox News poll was five points more favorable to Republicans every year than the actual election results, they would lose credibility. The same in reverse is true for an outlet like MSNBC. The professionals behind each of those polls are working to make them as accurate as they can be, because that's what they\u2019re getting judged on. At the end of the day, the goal is accuracy.\n\nFC: All these polls at some point have to run up against what happens on election day \u2014 our version of the Super Bowl. If you want to stay in the polling business, you better be in the ballpark or else have a good explanation as to what happened.\n\nRMPBS: What happens if the pollster performs poorly?\n\nFC: You won\u2019t get hired. Your newspaper will lose credibility. Newspapers frequently change pollsters when things don\u2019t go well.\n\nRMPBS: How much can a poll influence a voter? Does the poll itself affect how people will vote?\n\nFC: There really is no definitive answer. There is no doubt that polling affects news coverage. There is a tendency for news outlets to ask the frontrunner why they\u2019re ahead and ask more positive questions - and ask more negative questions toward the opponent e.g. \u201cWhy is Mr. Trump behind? He seems flummoxed and confused.\u201d\n\nOne reason why the news was so bad for Biden after his terrible debate performance is [that] it was being reinforced by polls showing the public thought he did terrible. The polls led the news to question him further about his age and his capabilities. That\u2019s an effect strictly related to the media.\n\nThe effect you\u2019re asking about is the bandwagon effect. If a poll comes out and says, say, \u201cHarris is ahead,\u201d will it lead more people to get on the bandwagon? The evidence is mixed. The one thing about the bandwagon effect is that that wagon can stop at any point.\n\nThere could also be a dampening effect. If a candidate is far behind, people may feel like there is no use in voting. However, evidence shows the dampening effect is not very strong because the candidate who is trailing behind will campaign harder and say \u201cWe\u2019re close. Get out there and vote!\u201d and send more emails and text messages encouraging people to vote. So really there is no definitive answer on either the bandwagon effect or the dampening effect.\n\n\n\n\n\nRMPBS: Is the purpose of polling simply to inform \u2014 or is to skew the electorate one way or the other?\n\n\n\nAS: Polls conducted by the media are really designed to hold up a mirror to the public and show what people are thinking and what issues they find important. There\u2019s not a lot of persuasion in there. It\u2019s not the role of the media to be persuading people.\n\nPolls sponsored by a candidate or by advocates for a ballot initiative \u2014 their purpose is typically to develop strategy. The poll is like testing a petri dish in a laboratory.\n\nIf we\u2019re doing a poll for a candidate, we might test positives and negatives on our own candidate so that we know strategically what their biggest vulnerabilities are. Let's say that the candidate failed out of school and has a DUI on their record. It\u2019s helpful to know which is the bigger vulnerability. If the poll shows it\u2019s the DUI, the candidate can strategize and decide not to go out campaigning about personal responsibility and making the right choice, because at some point that\u2019s going to blow back up.\n\nRMPBS: Have there been any notable moments in Colorado history where polling came front and center?\n\nFC: In general, there\u2019s not a lot of national polling going on in Colorado anymore. When we were a battleground state, back in 1998 and 2000 \u2014 when Bush won, things were different. But Obama killed it in 2008 and since then, a lot of young people, mostly liberals, moved in and now we\u2019re no longer a swing state.\n\nThere\u2019s a very good pollster in Colorado, Chris Keating, president of Keating Research who\u2019s polled for Adam Frisch, the current democratic candidate for Colorado\u2019s 3rd congressional district and who ran in 2022 against incumbent Lauren Boebert and came incredibly close.\n\nKeating was one of the only pollsters that said that Frisch was close and actually had at least one poll that said he was winning back in 2022\u2019s midterm elections. A lot of the Republican commentators said that was incredibly unlikely, that it was a firmly Republican district by several percentage points. And it turned out that Keating was absolutely right [Frisch lost to Boebert by only 546 votes].\n\nThat was an example of a pollster catching what was really going on. For the upcoming November 2024 election, Boebert has swapped districts and is now running for the 4th congressional district because she knew she would lose her current 3rd district.\n\nRMPBS: Who conducts polling calls over the phone? Are they in the U.S. or abroad?\n\nAS: Pollsters design the surveys, write the questions, figure out who to call, analyze the data and figure out what the data means. But we don\u2019t do the actual calling. Most of that is done by call centers or phone banks, the best of which are in the U.S. A lot are in the Midwest.\n\nYou want your interviewers to have a pretty neutral accent. If you had somebody calling up with a thick southern accent asking questions about, let's say, gun control and reproductive rights, you might feel less comfortable talking to that person if you could imply what you thought that person's views were.\n\nRMPBS: Is the selection process for a caller as intensive as picking a jury and assessing what their political views are? Is it like auditioning an actor?\n\nAS: No, it\u2019s not that so much. The interviews are often recorded and monitored so you can go back and figure out if there were any problems. You can go back and see, for example, if a particular interviewer got more completed interviews with women than men or with Democrats than Republicans. And if that were the case, that could flag that something is not quite right, that the interviewer is not as neutral as they should be.\n\nRMPBS: Do people conducting the polls tend to reveal who they are working for?\n\nAS: They will almost always say, \u201cI work for a research company.\u201d That\u2019s because if you got a call and the interviewer said they worked for the Lauren Boebert campaign and wanted to poll you on something, many Democrats might just hang up and say, \u201cNever call me again.\u201d\n\nEven callers working for polls sponsored by media outlets generally don\u2019t mention who's sponsoring the poll. Certainly a long time ago it was fine to say, \u201cHey, I\u2019m from the New York Times or CNN and I\u2019m taking a poll.\u201d That\u2019s not true anymore.\n\nRMPBS: Where do the callers get the contact information of the people on their list?\n\nAS: If you're conducting a phone survey, one method is to just dial numbers randomly. I kid you not. It's a very statistically valid method. If I was doing a national poll and knew I needed ten responses out of Rhode Island, I could dial 401 for Rhode Island and then randomly enter the next seven numbers. That's a totally reasonable way to get a random sample of the population.\n\nMost call centers work off voter files. When people sign up to vote, they often enter their name, address, and date of birth which gets inputted into a database. There are commercial vendors that may append other information to that record such as credit bureau information.\n\nRMPBS: Is there anything we didn\u2019t touch on that you\u2019d like to add?\n\nFC: Polling is hugely important. Joe Biden dropped out of the race because of polling. The Democratic Party, whose primary job is to win elections, came to the conclusion they couldn\u2019t win. It showed the real power of polling.\n\nJust as the reputation of the media has gone down in terms of trust, so has ours. We are working in the same environment trying to get people to answer our surveys. Restoring trust in media and in polling is very important from my point of view.\n\nAS: Nothing to add other than encouraging people to pick up the phone when the pollster calls!\n\n",

        "text": "U.S. accuses Russia of sprawling election interference campaign, seizes dozens of fake sites\nWashington \u2014 The Biden administration accused Russia of attempting to interfere in the 2024 presidential election, including through a sophisticated influence campaign that involved the creation of fake news sites designed to covertly spread Russian propaganda.\n\nThe Justice Department filed charges against two people and seized more than two dozen internet domains used in a foreign malign influence campaign, allegedly directed by the Russian government, officials said. The State and Treasury Departments are set to announce a series of parallel actions against Russia.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland announced the efforts at the start of a meeting of the Election Threats Task Force that included FBI Director Chris Wray and top Justice Department officials.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland speaks during a meeting of the Justice Department's Election Threats Task Force on Wednesday, Sept. 4, 2024, in Washington. Mark Schiefelbein / AP\n\nProsecutors unsealed an indictment in federal district court in New York charging two Russia-based employees of RT, a state-controlled media outlet, of conspiring to commit money laundering and conspiring to violate the Federal Agents Registration Act.\n\nGarland said RT and the two employees implemented a $10 million scheme to fund and direct a Tennessee-based company to publish and disseminate information favorable to the Russian government. The content was consistent with Russia's goal to push U.S. divisions and anti-Ukraine content, according to Garland.\n\n\"The American people are entitled to know when a foreign power is attempting to exploit our country's free exchange of ideas in order to send around its own propaganda,\" he said.\n\nGarland also announced that the Justice Department seized 32 internet domains that the Russian government and pro-Russian actors used to engage in what he said was a \"covert campaign to interfere and influence the outcome of our country's elections.\"\n\nThe attorney general said the two schemes \"make clear the ends to which the Russian government, including at its highest levels, is willing to go to undermine our democratic process.\"\n\n\"This is deadly serious and we are going to treat it accordingly,\" Garland said.\n\nThe \"Doppelganger\" campaign\n\nAccording to a 71-page affidavit unsealed in federal district court in Pennsylvania, the seized 32 internet domains have been used by the Russian government and government-backed actors to engage in foreign malign influence campaigns called \"Doppelganger,\" in violation of U.S. money laundering and criminal trademark laws. The filing includes more than 200 pages of exhibits showing documents and images related to the scheme.\n\nFederal investigators said Russian companies have used the domains, some of which impersonated legitimate news entities and unique media brands, to covertly spread Russian government propaganda, and did so at the direction of Russian President Vladimir Putin's administration since at least 2022.\n\nGarland said Putin's \"inner circle\" directed Russian public relations companies to promote disinformation and state-sponsored narratives as part of efforts to influence the upcoming presidential election. He said an internal planning document created by the Kremlin stated one of the campaign's goals is \"securing Russia's preferred outcome in the election.\"\n\nThe campaigns involved using \"cybersquatted\" domains, which are intended to mimic another entity's domain name and trick visitors into believing they are visiting the legitimate website. These sites, Garland said, were designed to look like major U.S.-based news outlets such as the Washington Post or Fox News, by using the same layout and design, but were fake sites spreading Russian propaganda created by the Kremlin.\n\nAmong the goals of the campaigns are to \"reduce international support for Ukraine, bolster pro-Russian policies and interests, and influence voters in the U.S. and foreign elections\" while concealing the Russian government and its agents as the source of the content, according to the court filings.\n\nThe Justice Department accused Doppelganger of using \"influencers\" worldwide, paid social media advertisements and fake social media profiles purporting to be U.S. citizens to drive viewership to the domains, \"all of which attempted to trick viewers into believing they were being directed to a legitimate news media outlet's website.\"\n\nProjects directed at the U.S. include the \"Good Old USA Project,\" \"Guerilla Media Campaign,\" and \"U.S. Social Media Influencers Network Project,\" according to court filings.\n\nThe Justice Department obtained notes, project proposals, planning documents and other records during its investigation, some of which detail objectives, target audiences and campaign topics. The department redacted the names of the political parties and presidential candidates, labeling them only as U.S. Political Party A or B, or Candidate A or B, but the documents include information that makes them identifiable.\n\nObjectives of the \"Good Old USA\" project include boosting the percentage of Americans who believe the U.S. is \"doing way too much to support Ukraine,\" and lowering President Biden's confidence rating down to at least 29% in the lead-up to the November election, according to documents submitted by the Justice Department. The document appears to have been prepared in late 2023, when Mr. Biden was still seeking reelection.\n\nTarget audiences included battleground-state residents whose votes will impact the outcome of the presidential contest, residents of \"conservative states where traditional values are strong who more often vote for candidates of\" an unidentified political party, gamers, Jewish Americans and Hispanic Americans, according to the filings. Though redacted, the document appears to be referring to the Republican Party.\n\nDocuments associated with the \"Guerilla Media Campaign\" call for a variety of fears and views held by an unnamed political party \u2014 again, believed to be the GOP \u2014 to be exploited, including concerns about the cost of living and \"losing the American way of life.\" It lists campaign topics as \"risk of job loss for white Americans\"; the threat of crime from people of color and immigrants, including those from Ukraine; and overspending on foreign policy \"at the expense of interests of white US citizens.\"\n\n\"Target supporters\" are an unnamed political party, supporters of an unnamed candidate, \"supporters of traditional family values\" and White Americans. While the party and candidate names are redacted, context makes clear the project is referring to the Republican Party and former President Donald Trump.\n\nDocuments about the \"U.S. Social Media Influencers Network\" describes the GOP as \"currently advancing a relatively pro-Russian agenda\" that can be \"exploited by posing as ardent [Republicans] and relaying the part of their agenda that coincides with ours.\"\n\nA proposal for the project calls for creating and developing a network of 200 accounts on Twitter, now known as X, with four in each state. Two of those four will be \"active\" and two will be \"dormant,\" according to the documents.\n\nThe proposal states that active accounts would be maintained on behalf of a fake person who supports the GOP. It calls for building a \"multi-level protection\" of infrastructure in order to \"eliminate the possibility of detection of the 'Russian footprint,'\" that includes virtual private network services and physical services in the U.S., the documents show.\n\nThe European Union sanctioned seven Russians and five Russian entitles for their roles in \"Doppelganger\" in July 2023, and accused them of running a \"digital information manipulation campaign\" called Recent Reliable News designed to spread propaganda in support of Russia's war against Ukraine.\n\nElection interference warnings\n\nWray and other Biden administration officials have warned that the Russian government and other foreign adversaries have continued trying to interfere with the electoral process.\n\n\"They're still at it,\" the FBI leader told the House Judiciary Committee during a hearing in July. \"We've seen that in election cycle after election cycle.\"\n\nAlready, the FBI has disrupted a Russian AI-enhanced social media bot farm that spread disinformation in the U.S., which was designed to be an influence operation. Some of the fictitious profiles from bots purported to be Americans.\n\nWray said such efforts to influence U.S. elections were not limited to Russia, but also Iran \u2014 in 2020 and 2024 \u2014 and China.\n\nJen Easterly, director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, also warned about threats related to the 2024 election.\n\n\"We can absolutely expect that our foreign adversaries will remain a persistent threat, attempting to undermine American confidence in our democracy and our institutions, and to sow partisan discord,\" she told reporters Tuesday. \"And that's why it is up to all of us not to let our foreign adversaries be successful.\"\n\nThe FBI, CISA and Office of the Director of National Intelligence said in a rare joint statement last month that the agencies have seen \"increasingly aggressive Iranian activity\" during the 2024 election cycle that specifically involves influence operations targeting the American public and cyber operations aimed at presidential campaigns.\n\nThose efforts by Iran include recent activities to compromise former President Donald Trump's 2024 campaign, the agencies said. The intelligence community is \"confident that the Iranians have through social engineering and other efforts sought access to individuals with direct access to the presidential campaigns of both political parties,\" the intelligence agencies warned.\n\nThe Russian government has for the last two presidential election cycles mounted influence operations. Their attempts in 2016 were sprawling and sophisticated, analyses of the efforts found, and involved extensive efforts to sow division among Americans and erode trust in democratic institutions through social media.\n\nThirteen Russian nationals and entities were charged in February 2018 as a result of efforts to interfere with the 2016 election, 12 of whom worked at the Internet Research Agency, a Russian troll farm that led the efforts to spread discord in the U.S.\n\nThe U.S. intelligence community said in an unclassified assessment nearly one year ago that Russia waged campaigns in at least 11 elections across nine democracies, including the U.S., between 2020 and 2022.",

        "text": "US accuses Russia of interfering with presidential election\nMr Garland said that Moscow wanted to secure a \"preferred outcome\" in the race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris.\n\nWhite House national security spokesman John Kirby said that Russia's programme was aimed at \"reducing international support for Ukraine, bolstering pro-Russian policies and interests, and influencing voters here in the US\".\n\nA Treasury official meanwhile said that RT and other Russian state media had engaged in a \"nefarious campaign to covertly recruit unwittingly American influencers in support of their malign activity\".\n\nThe Biden administration's response so far includes:\n\nCharging two Moscow-based managers of RT - Kostiantyn Kalashnikov, 31, and Elena Afanasyeva, 27 - for paying content creators on US soil to \"pump pro-Russia propaganda and disinformation\" to US audiences;\n\nSanctioning two entities and 10 people including Simonyan, RT editor-in-chief, for \"activities that aim to deteriorate public trust in our institutions\";\n\nRestricting visas for employees of Kremlin-backed media outlets;\n\nSeizing 32 internet domain names used to \"covertly promote AI-generated false narratives\" targeting specific US demographics and regions on social media;\n\nDesignating Rossiya Segodnya and five of its subsidiaries (RIA Novosti, RT, TV-Novosti, Ruptly, and Sputnik) as \"foreign missions\", requiring them to report information about their personnel to the US government;\n\nOffering a $10m reward for information on hackers associated with the Russian group, Russian Angry Hackers Did It (RaHDit).\n\nMuch of the Kremlin's disinformation effort is directed and funded by RT, Mr Kirby said.\n\n\"RT is no longer just a propaganda arm of the Kremlin,\" he said. \"It's being used to advance covert Russian influence actions.\"\n\nThe state media outlet mocked the US government's accusations, saying in a statement to the BBC that \"2016 called and it wants its clich\u00e9s back\".\n\n\"Three things are certain in life: death, taxes and RT's interference in the US elections.\"\n\nThe criminal indictments of Kalashnikov and Afanasyeva do not identify by name the Tennessee-based content creation company they used.\n\nBut the court filing's description of \"a network of heterodox commentators that focus on Western political and cultural issues\" matches the self-description carried on the website of an outlet named Tenet Media.\n\nTenet posts thousands of English-language videos on social media, and promotes well-known right-wing commentators Benny Johnson, Tim Pool and Dave Rubin as its \"talent\".\n\nPool said on Twitter/X that he and other commentators had been \"deceived\" and were themselves victims.\n\nThe company has been contacted for comment.",

        "text": "Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ning\u2019s Regular Press Conference on September 4, 2024\nAt the invitation of Premier Li Qiang of the State Council, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re will pay an official visit to China from September 9 to 11.\n\nCCTV: You just announced Norwegian Prime Minister St\u00f8re\u2019s upcoming official visit to China. Could you share with us the program and China\u2019s expectation of the visit?\n\n\n\nMao Ning: During Prime Minister St\u00f8re\u2019s visit, President Xi Jinping will meet with him, and Premier Li Qiang and Chairman Zhao Leji will have talks and meet with him respectively. The two sides will have an in-depth exchange of views on bilateral relations and issues of mutual interest.\n\nNorway is one of the first Western countries to recognize New China. This year marks the 70th anniversary of China-Norway diplomatic ties. China highly values its relations with Norway. China hopes that through this visit, the two sides will together carry forward the traditional friendship, consolidate political mutual trust, expand practical cooperation, advance the green transition, and work for the sustained, sound and steady growth of bilateral relations.\n\nKyodo News: Chinese and Japanese defense authorities launched the direct hotline of the maritime and aerial communication mechanism in May last year. Keeping the hotline working is conducive to controlling risks and enhancing the two sides\u2019 ability to manage crises at sea and in the air. Can you comment on the importance of the practice?\n\n\n\nMao Ning: The direct hotline between Chinese and Japanese defense authorities as part of the maritime and aerial communication mechanism is a concrete measure to deliver on the important common understandings between the leaders of the two countries. The measure is a useful addition to the communication channels between the defense authorities of the two countries and for the two sides to enhance ability to manage maritime and aerial contingencies. It is also conducive to peace and stability in the region.\n\nChina-Arab TV: We noted that various events such as the Conference of Chinese and African Entrepreneurs are held on the sidelines of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation. Chinese energy companies, notably CNPC, have carried out in-depth cooperation with African countries in various areas, contributing significantly to local social and economic development. How does the Chinese government view the prospect of China-Africa energy cooperation?\n\n\n\nMao Ning: I\u2019d refer you to competent authorities and businesses on the cooperation between Chinese and African companies. Let me say more broadly that energy cooperation is an important part of China-Africa cooperation. China has deepened energy cooperation with Africa in recent years through technology transfer, project cooperation and financial support. China has delivered several hundred clean energy and green development projects in Africa, which have helped African countries enhance energy security and mitigated the impact of climate change in Africa and globally. There is enormous demand and broad prospect for energy cooperation between China and Africa, which is expected to benefit Africa\u2019s green, low-carbon and high-quality development.\n\nRIA Novosti: According to our exclusive analysis, Ukraine continues to purchase Chinese-made drones, despite objections from the Chinese drone manufacturer. What\u2019s China\u2019s comment?\n\n\n\nMao Ning: I\u2019m not aware of the specifics you mentioned. What I can tell you is that China exercises strict export control over dual-use articles, including drones, and opposes using civilian drones for military purposes.\n\nYonhap News Agency: According to reports, Pak Jin-a, DPRK basketball player, returned to her home country just one month after joining Wuhan Shengfan, a Chinese professional women\u2019s basketball club in June. Is Pak\u2019s early return to the DPRK related to the sanctions on the DPRK?\n\n\n\nMao Ning: I\u2019m currently not aware of what you mentioned.\n\nBeijing Daily: Africa has long been beset by war, hunger, terrorism, among other security challenges. President Xi Jinping stressed the need to build a China-Africa community with a shared future that enjoys common security. Could you share with us China\u2019s effort and what has been accomplished in its cooperation with Africa in this field?\n\n\n\nMao Ning: Realizing lasting peace and common security is the common aspiration of the Chinese and African people. Helping each other on security issues is very much essential for building a high-level China-Africa community with a shared future. China put forward the Global Security Initiative, and has taken an active part in the UN peacekeeping operations, mediation efforts on hotspot issues in Africa, and efforts to facilitate dialogue and cooperation between regional countries on issues related to Sahel, the Horn of Africa, and the Great Lakes Region and so on. China supports Africa in capacity-building on maintaining peace and stability and fighting terrorism, and has provided emergency food assistance to Africa on humanitarian grounds several times to help the continent cope with food and other non-traditional security challenges.\n\nPeace and security will be a major agenda topic of FOCAC Beijing Summit. We look forward to working with African countries to implement the Global Security Initiative, address security challenges, and promote world peace and development.\n\nBloomberg: On Eswatini. It\u2019s the only African country not participating in FOCAC. What\u2019s the latest view from the Chinese Foreign Ministry on ties with Eswatini? More broadly, can you characterize the ties between the two countries that exist right now both from a political and economic perspective?\n\n\n\nMao Ning: There is but one China in the world, and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China\u2019s territory. This is a prevailing consensus in the international community. African countries widely support the one-China principle and view their cooperation with China as helpful for Africa\u2019s economic prosperity and sustainable development.\n\nDeveloping official relations with the Taiwan region is not in Eswatini\u2019s interest. We believe Eswatini will eventually see the prevailing trend in the world and make the right decision accordingly.\n\nAntara: Regarding Global South cooperation, Indonesia also held the Second Indonesia-Africa Forum from September 1 to 3, aiming for more equitable and inclusive development for developing countries. Similarly, China identifies FOCAC as a prime example of Global South cooperation for China and African countries. Considering African countries, what makes the continent so important for this so-called Global South cooperation?\n\n\n\nMao Ning: In conducting cooperation with Africa, China is committed to the principle of sincerity, real results, amity and good faith and the right approach to friendship and interests. Our cooperation is defined by sincerity, equality, mutual benefit, fairness and justice, and openness and inclusiveness. China and Africa have been actively implementing the outcomes of FOCAC. Those efforts contribute significantly to the common development of China and African countries and deliver tangible benefits to the two peoples. This has laid a solid foundation for the building of a high-level China-Africa community with a shared future.\n\nChina and Indonesia are both major developing countries and important members of the Global South. China stands ready to enhance cooperation with Indonesia to jointly support African countries and other Global South partners in achieving development and prosperity.\n\nReuters: US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Podesta will visit China this week. What specific topics will be on the table? Anything you can share with us regarding what they might agree on? Also, how will the US presidential election in November be a factor in this discussion?\n\n\n\nMao Ning: I\u2019d refer you to competent authorities on that.",

Respondents were selected from YouGov\u2019s opt-in panel to be representative of U.S. adult citizens. A random sample (stratified by gender, age, race, education, geographic region, and voter registration) was selected from the 2019 American Community Survey. The sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, education, 2020 election turnout and presidential vote, baseline party identification, and current voter registration status. Demographic weighting targets come from the 2019 American Community Survey. Baseline party identification is the respondent\u2019s most recent answer given prior to November 1, 2022, and is weighted to the estimated distribution at that time (33% Democratic, 31% Republican). The margin of error for the overall sample is approximately 3%.\n\nImage: Getty (Spencer Platt / Staff)\n\nWhat do you think about the election, American politics in general, and everything else?

Ware, a current professor at the University of California at Santa Barbara, received his Ph.D. from Penn and was a former professor at the University of Michigan.\n\nFollowing the announcement, Ware mentioned his plans to help the campaign secure votes in battleground states like Pennsylvania and Michigan, where the Arab American vote is expected to play a crucial role.\n\n\u201cI am a scholar and I am a teacher,\u201d Ware said. \u201cBut know this that if I am called into a fight, the fight for the struggle of freedom in our time, I am not going to back down from that fight.\"\n\nWare, who specializes in West African history, African American history, and Islamic intellectual history, is also a practicing Muslim. His academic focus aligns closely with the Green Party\u2019s platform, which has long emphasized issues of imperialism, colonialism, and social justice.\n\nStein \u2014 who has run for president on the Green Party ticket twice before in 2012 and 2016 \u2014 has made headlines for her strong stance on the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. A central pillar of her campaign is advocating for a ceasefire in Gaza and ending U.S. military aid to Israel.\n\nIn a statement on X announcing her vice presidential selection, Stein described the Green Party ticket as a \u201ctruly a historic ticket\" for bringing together \"a Jewish woman and Black Muslim man against genocide, endless war, climate collapse, and rampant injustice.\"\n\nThe Green Party has sought to galvanize voters who are disillusioned with the current administration \u2014 particularly those in the Arab American community \u2014 who have been vocal in their opposition to President and former Penn professor Joe Biden\u2019s policies on the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nStein was reportedly seeking a Palestinian American as her vice presidential running mate. One prominent prospective candidate included Noura Erakat, a human rights lawyer and a professor at Rutgers University.\n\nErakat, who was on Penn's campus as part of programming held during the Gaza Solidarity Encampment on College Green and spoke in March 2023 at a Penn Students Against The Occupation of Palestine speaker event, announced series of posts on X on the day of Stein's announcement that she would not be joining the Green Party\u2019s ticket due to a disagreement over the campaign's strategy.\n\nErakat claimed that, while she viewed the Green Party as strong on issues related to Palestine, they could not align on how to approach the current political moment.\n\n\u201cMy priority remains our collective liberation, rooted in ending genocide facilitated by US cover & relentless arms transfers [to] Israel,\u201d the posts read. \u201cI offered to join [the] ticket if they would be willing to concede the election if Dems deliver on [a] permanent ceasefire and arms embargo. The idea being using Stein\u2019s margin in 3 swing states to compel those concessions.\u201d\n\nA recent poll in Pennsylvania suggests that third-party candidates have the potential to influence the outcome of the presidential race, potentially hindering the Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris' chances. The poll, conducted from Aug. 27-29, shows Harris and Republican presidential nominee and 1968 Wharton graduate Donald Trump tied at 49% each in a direct matchup.\n\nSign up for our newsletter Get our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning. Sign Up\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, when third-party candidates are included, Trump leads Harris by a narrow margin, with 48% to her 47%. Stein is currently polling at 1% in the state.\n\nThis pattern aligns with previous polling, where Harris led Trump by 1 point in a head-to-head race, but Trump gained a slight edge when third-party candidates were considered. The threat of third-party candidates to both Harris and Trump is especially great in states like Pennsylvania, whose 19 electoral votes have been slated to determine the outcome of November\u2019s election.\n\nBoth Harris and Trump have focused heavily on Pennsylvania during the election campaign, with frequent campaign events to the state.\n\nThe Daily Pennsylvanian is an independent, student-run newspaper.

        "text": "The 2024 Election and Tax Policy for Asset Management\nThe 2024 election is likely to profoundly impact tax policy and legislation. Once the dust settles on the results, the incoming president and Congress will have a tall task in 2025, as the expiration of several 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) provisions will loom large and many other tax policy proposals will be on the table. All of the moving parts have inspired pundits to refer to 2025 as a year we will see the \u201cSuper Bowl of Tax\u201d.\n\nThis article highlights some of the important tax provisions in play for the asset management industry and related considerations.\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Provisions of the TCJA Set to Expire at the End of 2025\n\nWithout legislative action extending the provisions, several changes enacted under the TCJA will expire at the end of 2025, including:\n\nIndividual tax rates will revert back to pre-2018 levels, so the highest rate will increase from 37% to 39.6% for ordinary income.\n\nThe $10,000 limit on state and local tax (SALT) deductions will be eliminated, obviating the need, in some cases, for pass-through entity tax (PTET) elections.\n\nThe Qualified Business Income deduction under Section 199A, which benefits partners and owners of certain pass-through businesses, will be eliminated; this would impact choice of entity considerations for private equity and venture capital portfolio companies.\n\nDeductions for management fees and other portfolio expenses, currently disallowed under Section 212 for partners in \u201cinvestor\u201d funds, will once again be deductible, albeit with limitations.\n\nThe estate tax lifetime exclusion amount will revert back to roughly $7 million, significantly less than the current exclusion amount, which is $13.6 million; there may be significant planning and gifting activity involving fund interests in 2025 if this change appears imminent.\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer President Trump has expressed support for extending the TCJA in its entirety. Vice President Harris would be in favor of extending certain provisions, such as the reduced individual tax rates, for taxpayers with less than $400,000 of taxable income. She would, however, seek to increase tax rates for both ordinary and capital gain income for taxpayers with income more than $400,000 and $1 million, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Relevant Provisions at Stake in 2025\n\nDepending on the election outcome, there are other provisions that may be a part of legislative negotiations between Congress and the White House next year. Several of those provisions would impact funds, general partners, and portfolio companies. These include:\n\nCorporate tax rates: Vice President Harris has proposed raising the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%, whereas former President Trump has proposed lowering it to 15%.\n\nVice President Harris has proposed raising the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%, whereas former President Trump has proposed lowering it to 15%. Carried interests: Consistent with the Biden administration\u2019s proposals, Harris would propose to tax certain carried interest allocations at ordinary income rates plus self-employment tax, regardless of holding period; Trump has not proposed any changes to current law, which requires a holding period of over three years.\n\nConsistent with the Biden administration\u2019s proposals, Harris would propose to tax certain carried interest allocations at ordinary income rates plus self-employment tax, regardless of holding period; Trump has not proposed any changes to current law, which requires a holding period of over three years. Tax on unrealized gains: Harris supports the Biden administration\u2019s proposal to impose a 25% minimum tax on taxable income, inclusive of unrealized gains, for taxpayers with a net worth more than $100 million.\n\nHarris supports the Biden administration\u2019s proposal to impose a 25% minimum tax on taxable income, inclusive of unrealized gains, for taxpayers with a net worth more than $100 million. Excess business loss limitations (Section 461(l)): Harris would propose to eliminate the favorable loss carryover rules that apply under current law.\n\nHarris would propose to eliminate the favorable loss carryover rules that apply under current law. Limits on business interest expense under Section 163(j): These rules may be revised to be more favorable, depending on the landscape in Congress next year. There was bipartisan support in the House of Representatives for this in early 2024, but the bill stalled in the Senate. In light of higher interest rates, these limits currently have a significant impact on some hedge fund investors as well as private equity and venture capital portfolio companies.\n\nThese rules may be revised to be more favorable, depending on the landscape in Congress next year.

Bonus depreciation rules: The rules are currently being phased out and are scheduled to expire at the end of 2026. Similar to the Section 163(j) revision noted above, there was bipartisan support in the House in early 2024 to once again allow immediate expensing of certain business assets. That proposal may also resurface in 2025.\n\nThe rules are currently being phased out and are scheduled to expire at the end of 2026.

That proposal may also resurface in 2025. The Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s clean energy tax credits: The credits \u2013 some of which could be bought or sold by funds \u2013 are supported by the Biden-Harris administration but could be rolled back in a second Trump term.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results of the congressional elections will also be a key determinant of what direction tax policy goes in during 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsiderations for the Asset Management Industry\n\nAll of the variables underscore the importance of scenario planning and modeling. For example, if the sunsetting of the lower individual tax rates is expected, certain \u201creverse\u201d tax planning may be in order \u2013 such as accelerating income into 2025. Private equity and venture capital funds could consider electing out of the installment sale rules to accelerate gain into 2025. And hedge funds could plan for this scenario through the careful navigation of timing issues such as the constructive sale rules.\n\nFund managers should be proactive about discussing potential tax changes with their advisors and having a game plan in place for different scenarios.",

        "text": "Harris or Trump? Allan Lichtman Releases His Prediction\n\u201cThe Democrats will hold on to the White House, and Kamala Harris will be the next president of the United States,\u201d Lichtman told The New York Times today in a video. Watch Lichtman's prediction here.\n\nLichtman\u2019s prediction is based on 13 Keys, a model he developed with Russian geophysicist Vladimir Keilis-Borok in 1981. The 13 Keys ignore all polls and pollsters. They focus on 13 true-false statements. If six or more of the keys are false, the incumbent party is predicted to lose the election. If five or fewer are false, the incumbent is expected to win.\n\nThe keys include whether:\n\nThe White House party gained House seats during the midterm elections The sitting president is running for re-election The White House party is avoiding a primary contest There is a third-party challenger The short-term economy is strong The long-term economy growth has been as good as the last two terms The White House party has made major changes to national policy There is sustained social unrest during the term The White House is untainted by scandal, the incumbent party is charismatic The challenger is uncharismatic The incumbent is charismatic The White House party has major failure in foreign policy The White House party has foreign policy success.\n\nLichtman found that eight of the keys are true (in Harris\u2019 favor), while three are false, favoring Trump. But, of course, the election is still several months away, and two keys, a foreign policy failure or a foreign policy success, could still flip before then.\n\nLichtman has some advice for readers. \u201cKamala Harris will be the next president of the United States, at least that\u2019s my prediction for this race, but the outcome is up to you, so get out and vote,\u201d he says.\n\nTo keep on top of Lichtman\u2019s predictions and his take on other political issues, tune into his live show every Tuesday and Thursday at 9 p.m. EST on YouTube.\n\nMore About Professor Lichtman\n\nProfessor Lichtman received his PhD from Harvard University in 1973 with a specialty in modern American history and quantitative methods. He became an Assistant Professor of History at American University in 1973 and a Full Professor in 1980, and a Distinguished Professor in 2011. He received the Scholar/Teacher of the year award for 1992-93. He has published 11 books and several hundred popular and scholarly articles. He has lectured in the US and internationally and provided commentary for major US and foreign networks and leading newspapers and magazines across the world. He has been an expert witness in some 100 civil and voting rights cases. His book, White Protestant Nation: The Rise of the American Conservative Movement was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award in nonfiction. His co-authored book with Richard Breitman, FDR and the Jews, won the National Jewish Book Award Prize in American Jewish History and was a finalist for the Los Angeles Times book prize in history. His book, The Case for Impeachment, was a national independent bookstore bestseller. Lichtman was listed by rise.global as #85 among 100 most influential geopolitical experts in the world and received the lifetime achievement award from Who's Who.",

        "text": "Harris or Trump? A New Tool Gauges How the World Would Vote in the 2024 Election\nAs the U.S. election season heats up, people around the world want to know how Americans will vote in the upcoming presidential elections. But how would people in other countries vote in the U.S. election? Tom Etienne, a joint doctoral student at the Annenberg School for Communication and the Department of Political Science at the University of Pennsylvania, is helping answer that question.\n\nThis election season, he is part of a team at the Penn Program on Opinion Research and Election Studies (PORES), an undergraduate research program dedicated to developing data-driven approaches to understanding political outcomes in the United States, that is partnering with Dutch research institute Kieskompas to create an online tool that allows people around the world to compare their political views with those of Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.\n\nTom W. Etienne\n\nLaunching in mid-October, this voter advice application prompts users to rate how much they agree or disagree with statements revolving around issues that are dominating American election campaigns, like: \u201cTaxes on the wealthy should be increased\u201d or \u201cThe U.S. should complete the wall along the border with Mexico,\u201d and hopes to give global citizens a better understanding of how their views align with the candidates\u2019 positions.\n\n\u201cHopefully, our tool will share reliable information about one of the most impactful elections in the world, with the world that will feel its consequences,\u201d Etienne says. \u201cThis tool is also highly relevant to both U.S. and foreign policymakers. The degree of alignment between foreign countries and the U.S. can either hinder or support advancing U.S. foreign policy objectives.\u201d\n\nDuring the last presidential election, Etienne was part of a team at Kieskompas that created a version of this tool, nicknamed the \u201cTrump Meter,\u201d that allowed users to compare their views to those of then-candidates Joe Biden and Donald Trump. The \u201cTrump Meter\u201d was used by over 700,000 people across eight countries, revealing the degree to which each candidate\u2019s views resonated with different populations.\n\nFor example, the Danish newspaper B.T. Nyheder asked their readers to use the \u201cTrump Meter\u201d and found that in Denmark, men agreed with Trump more than women.\n\nSample results from the 2020 \u201cTrump Meter.\u201d\n\nEtienne hopes that the collaboration between the Annenberg School, PORES, and Kieskompas will enable the 2024 tool to reach a broader audience across different countries.\n\nTo achieve this, Etienne is seeking media partners in a diverse set of countries. Newspapers and news websites can request a translated version of the tool for integration into their platforms. The use of this tool not only offers readers unbiased information about the U.S. election but also allows the research team to contribute to data-driven journalism.",

        "text": "OSC Announces Hatch Act Enforcement Decisions\nPage Content\n\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nNavy Secretary Del Toro Found in Violation; Other Matters Closed, Including Involving Secretary Cardona and Former Attorney General Barr\n\n\n\nToday, the U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) announces several Hatch Act enforcement decisions. The Hatch Act, a federal law passed in 1939, limits certain political activity of federal employees. As relevant to the decisions announced today, employees may not engage in political activity while they are on duty, in the federal workplace, or acting in their official capacity, nor may employees solicit political contributions at any time. Political activity is activity directed toward the success or failure of a partisan candidate, political party, or partisan political group.\n\n\u201cAt OSC, we are committed to Hatch Act education and not just enforcement,\" said Special Counsel Hampton Dellinger. \u201cThe best way for federal employees, including agency leaders, to avoid Hatch Act violations is to check with us before -- not after -- doing something that might run afoul of the law. The enforcement decisions announced today involve officials and employees who acted without seeking advice. Some cases resulted in Hatch Act violations, while others have been closed without a finding of a violation. However, the safest and surest way to avoid a problem is to reach out to OSC on the front end. Regarding specific enforcement decisions, I want to acknowledge that balancing government employee speech rights with robust Hatch Act enforcement can be a challenge. I am grateful for the Hatch Act Unit's careful consideration of these cases.\"\n\nReport to the President on Hatch Act Violation by Navy Secretary Del Toro:\n\nOSC is transmitting to the President a finding that Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro violated the Hatch Act. Secretary Del Toro made statements in his official capacity advocating for and against the election of presidential candidates. For example, Sec. Del Toro said while speaking abroad on behalf of the Department of Defense, \u201cAnd so I'm confident that the American people will step up to the plate come November and support President Biden for a second term as our Commander-in-Chief, so that we can continue to work together as free democratic countries respect each other around the globe.\" The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using their official authority or influence to interfere with or affect the result of an election. The full report to the President can be found here.\n\nSpecial Counsel Dellinger: \u201cWhen speaking in his official capacity on a taxpayer-funded trip, Secretary Del Toro encouraged electoral support for one candidate over another in the upcoming presidential election. By doing so, he crossed a legal line and violated the Hatch Act. This is especially troubling because Secretary Del Toro has himself acknowledged that military work and partisan politics should not be mixed. As he stated just this past July: 'It is more important than ever for us to remember that the [Department of the Navy]is an apolitical body\u2026 Public trust and confidence depend on this.'\"\n\nEducation Secretary Cardona & Former Attorney General Barr Matters Closed Without Hatch Act Violation Findings:\n\nOSC received complaints alleging Hatch Act violations by Department of Education (ED) Secretary Miguel Cardona for sending a letter to student loan borrowers, responding to recent holdings by federal judges that temporarily blocked the Biden Administration's student debt plan and outlining steps that ED planned to take in response. In the letter, Sec. Cardona does not refer to candidates, elections, or voting but remarks that \u201cRepublican elected officials\" are \u201csiding with special interests\" and are trying to stop efforts by President Biden and ED \u201cto make repaying student debt affordable and realistic.\" As detailed in this advisory opinion, OSC concluded that Secretary Cardona did not violate the Hatch Act.\n\nOn July 25, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Inspector General referred to OSC A Report of Investigation Into the Department's Release of Public Statements Concerning a Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, Election Fraud Investigation in September 2020 to consider whether the conduct described, including by former Attorney General William Barr, violated the Hatch Act. After considering all facts and findings OSC is closing this matter without further action.\n\nSpecial Counsel Dellinger: \u201cBoth Secretary Cardona and former Attorney General Barr face allegations that they impermissibly injected partisan politics into communications about legal matters. OSC is closing these matters without finding Hatch Act violations in either case. But our closures should not be viewed as encouraging unnecessary partisan references, particularly in the context of legal discussions.\"\n\nProject 2025 & Infrastructure Signage Complaints:\n\nOSC has received complaints and questions about federal employee involvement with or workplace discussion of the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025. OSC has concluded that Project 2025-related activity associated with the Heritage Foundation, which is not \u201ca partisan political group\" as defined by federal regulations, does not constitute political activity for purposes of the Hatch Act, i.e., activity directed at the success or failure of a political party, partisan political group, or candidate for partisan political office.\n\nOSC has also received Hatch Act complaints involving signage placed at federally funded project sites that describes the funding source as, for example, \u201cPresident Joe Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.\" OSC has concluded that associating legislation with a particular president is not, by itself, political activity prohibited by the Hatch Act. Accordingly, OSC has closed these cases without finding violations.\n\nDisciplinary Action for Soliciting Political Contributions on Social Media:\n\nDuring this election season, OSC continues to identify Hatch Act violations by federal employees using social media to solicit political contributions. In one case, a U.S. Department of Commerce employee violated the Hatch Act by posting two Facebook messages while on duty supporting a local candidate in a partisan political election, one of which solicited monetary contributions to the candidate's campaign. The employee admitted he engaged in prohibited political activity, and in a settlement agreement, agreed to an unpaid 10-day suspension for violating the Hatch Act.\n\nIn another case, an employee with a U.S. Attorneys' Office shared on Facebook at least two messages that solicited financial contributions for a partisan political campaign. The messages solicited donations for the campaign of the employee's father, a candidate in a partisan primary election. In a settlement agreement, the employee admitted to violating the Hatch Act and agreed to a seven-day unpaid suspension as a penalty for their political activity.\n\nSpecial Counsel Hampton Dellinger: \u201cWhile OSC deals with some close calls in its Hatch Act enforcement, federal employees soliciting donations for a political campaign is express advocacy and a clear-cut violation. We urge federal employees not to cross these brightest of lines. When it happens, OSC will take action.\"\n\n***\n\n",

        "text": "U.S. accuses Russia of using unwitting influencers, fake news sites to sway presidential election\nThe United States on Wednesday took a series of actions against Russia in response to what it described as extensive efforts to meddle in the upcoming U.S. presidential election.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department said Russia has used state-run media, unwitting influencers and websites masquerading as prominent American news sites to spread disinformation and sway American voters ahead of the vote in November.\n\n\"The American people are entitled to know when a foreign power is attempting to exploit our country's free exchange of ideas in order to send around its own propaganda,\" U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland told reporters on Wednesday.\n\n\"That is what we allege happened in this case.\"\n\nIn one step announced Wednesday, the U.S. Justice Department unsealed criminal charges against two employees of RT, a Russian state-run media organization. An indictment said Kostiantyn Kalashnikov, 31, and Elena Afanasyeva, 27, directed a Tennessee-based content creation company to spread pro-Russia propaganda and erode support for Ukraine.\n\nU.S.-based influencers and personalities were recruited to help with the nearly $10-million US campaign. They did not know about Russia's involvement, Garland said, having been led to believe their work was being funded by a made-up investor named \"Eduard Grigoriann.\"\n\nCanadian connection\n\nThe indictment doesn't name the Tennessee company, but details in the court document match Tenet Media \u2014 a company founded by Canadian far-right commentator Lauren Chen and her husband Liam Donovan.\n\nThe indictment said the company in question is self-described as \"a network of heterodox commentators that focus on Western political and cultural issues,\" which matches word-for-word the description on Tenet Media's homepage. The indictment also said the company was incorporated on Jan. 19, 2022, which matches publicly available records with the Tennessee Secretary of State.\n\nCommentators like Benny Johnson, Tim Pool and Lauren Southern are among Tenet's personalities.\n\nThe indictment also includes more than a dozen references to another Canadian company owned by Chen and Donovan that was used as a vehicle to receive payment from RT.\n\nResearch by CBC News found a federally registered corporation linked to Chen and Donovan called Roaming Millennial Inc., which had an address in Montreal until last November.\n\nRoaming Millennial was Chen's username on YouTube and Instagram in her earlier days as a content creator.\n\nRoaming USA Corp. is the corporate name for the entity that operates Tenet Media.\n\nChen and Donovan were not named in the indictment and have not been criminally charged. Kalashnikov and Afanasyeva remain at large.\n\nA screenshot of one article on a Russian-funded website designed to mimic the American news outlet Fox News, as included in an affidavit filed in court on Wednesday. The U.S. Justice Department is moving to seize 32 such websites it says Russia wanted to use to influence American voters. (U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania)\n\nU.S. to seize web domains\n\nIn another action announced Wednesday, the U.S. Justice Department said it would seize 32 web domains it said Russian President Vladimir Putin used to covertly influence American elections.\n\nThe attorney general said the websites were designed to mimic major American news sites, like the Washington Post or Fox News.\n\n\"[The sites] were filled with Russian government propaganda that had been created by the Kremlin to reduce international support for Ukraine, bolster pro-Russian policies and influence voters in the United States and other countries,\" Garland said.\n\n\"An internal document of the Kremlin described the content as, quote, 'Bogus stories disguised as newsworthy events.' \"\n\nGarland, centre, speaks during a meeting of the Justice Department's Election Threats Task Force on Wednesday. Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, left, and FBI Director Christopher Wray, right, also spoke. (Mark Schiefelbein/The Associated Press)\n\nGarland said Putin's \"inner circle\" had directed Russian public relations companies to promote disinformation to help sway the American vote. He said those firms also recruited American influencers, who were again in the dark about the Russian connection.\n\n\"An internal planning document created by the Kremlin states that a goal of the campaign is securing Russia's preferred outcome in the election,\" Garland said.\n\nVladislav Inozemtsev, a Russian columnist and Putin critic who now lives in the U.S., said Russian propaganda is about destabilizing countries that aren't aligned with the Russian regime \u2014 not necessarily by ensuring preferred politicians win the race, but by stoking political tensions and distrust with regular citizens.\n\n\"Russian propaganda is very focused on the idea of undermining the existing political regimes in Western Europe and in the United States. It's not about getting more Russia-friendly figures on the top ... but to make [the country] more unstable,\" Inozemtsev told CBC News in an interview Wednesday.\n\n\"Whatever divides the nation which [Putin] believes is unfriendly to Russia, it's good for him.\"\n\nRussia, RT refute allegations\n\nA Russian lawmaker called the reported accusations again \"pure rubbish\" and said Moscow does not think it matters whether Republican Donald Trump or Democrat Kamala Harris wins the Nov. 5 election.\n\n\"The only winner of the U.S. election is the U.S. private military industrial complex,\" State Duma deputy Maria Butina told Reuters.\n\nThe Russian embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Moscow has repeatedly said it has not meddled in the U.S. election.\n\nLISTEN | The U.S. goes up against the Russian propaganda machine: Day 6 9:06 The US Justice department vs the Russian propaganda machine This week, the U.S. Department of Justice announced it disrupted a series of fake social media accounts that were pretending to be American citizens, while actually promoting Russian propaganda. We speak to John Scott-Railton, a researcher focusing on spyware and disinformation, about the dangers of A.I. being used as a tool for foreign interference.\n\nRT responded with ridicule.\n\n\"Three things are certain in life: death, taxes and RT's interference in the US elections,\" the media outlet told Reuters.\n\nThe outlet was forced to stopped operating in the U.S., the U.K., Canada and the European Union after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nOngoing threat to U.S. election\n\nThe Justice Department has previously warned Russia is still a key threat to American elections. U.S. officials have said Russia has not changed preference since previous American presidential elections, indicating Moscow favours Trump.\n\nU.S. intelligence assessments found Russia tried to help Trump in 2016 and 2020. The nation has denied the allegations.\n\nGarland also accused Iran on Wednesday of trying to influence the upcoming election through cyber operations against the campaigns of Trump and Harris. The Trump campaign has said Iran was responsible for recently leaking internal campaign documents to U.S. news outlets.",

        "text": "Donald Trump criminal sentencing delayed until after election\nTrump's criminal sentencing delayed until after election\n\nTrump was found guilty of 34 felony counts in May\n\nA New York jury in May convicted Trump on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, the first time a sitting or former president has been convicted of a crime.\n\nLawyers for Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, have used several legal manoeuvres to delay the sentencing, which had been scheduled for 18 September.\n\nJudge Juan Merchan on Friday delayed the sentencing to 26 November, citing \"the unique time frame this matter currently finds itself in\" among his reasons.\n\nDonald Trump's sentencing in his Manhattan hush money criminal trial has been postponed until after the November election.\n\nIn his decision, Judge Merchan wrote that the case demands \"a sentencing hearing that is entirely focused on the verdict of the jury\".\n\n\"Their verdict must be respected and addressed in a manner that is not diluted by the enormity of the upcoming presidential election,\" he said, setting sentencing to exactly three weeks after the 5 November election.\n\nHe said the delay was necessary \"to avoid any appearance - however unwarranted - that the proceeding has been affected by or seeks to affect the approaching presidential election in which the Defendant is a candidate\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Court is a fair, impartial and apolitical institution,\u201d the judge continued.\n\nTrump could face a sentence of up to four years in prison, but Judge Merchan also has the discretion to impose a punishment of a fine, probation or a shorter jail term.\n\nProsecutors in the case accused the former president of concealing a payment to buy the silence of Stormy Daniels, a former adult-film star, in the final days of his 2016 election campaign.\n\nMs Daniels testified that she and Trump had sex, and that she accepted $130,000 (\u00a399,000) from his former lawyer before the 2016 election in exchange to keep quiet about the encounter.\n\nProsecutors argued that, by approving a scheme to disguise the money as legal expenses, Trump broke the law.\n\nA jury found him guilty on all counts.\n\nTrump's original sentencing date was in July. His lawyers delayed that after a US Supreme Court ruling that granted presidents some immunity from criminal prosecution for \"official acts\".\n\nJudge Merchan granted a delay so that the parties could prepare arguments on the effects of the Supreme Court ruling on his case.\n\nA decision on the implications will come on 12 November.\n\nJudge Merchan has already dismissed some arguments made by Trump's lawyers to delay as \"unsubstantiated grievances... that do not merit this Court's attention\".\n\nBut he wrote that sentencing hearings are routinely delayed in other cases for reasons like personal circumstances or scheduling conflicts.\n\n\"Given the unique facts and circumstances of this case, there is no reason why this Defendant should be treated differently than any other,\" Judge Merchan said.\n\nHe added that his decision to delay \"should dispel any suggestion\" that the court would have made a decision that would be seen in support of \"any political party or any candidate for any office\".\n\nTrump has maintained that he did nothing wrong. He told Fox News after the ruling that the \"case should be dead\".\n\nOn his social media platform Truth Social, the former president re-iterated his claims of innocence, dismissing the case as a \"witch hunt\" and a \"political attack\".\n\n\"This case should be rightfully terminated, as we prepare for the Most Important Election in the History of our Country,\" he wrote.\n\nA spokesperson for Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney whose office brought the charges, said his team was \"ready for sentencing on the new date set by the court\".\n\nIf Trump is re-elected US president, he could order the Justice Department to drop the ongoing federal cases against him.\n\nHowever, this case in New York - as well as the election interference case in Georgia - involved state charges, and a president would not have the authority to interfere.",

        "text": "Kamala Harris's pain-free US election campaign faces first crunch moment\nKamala Harris's pain-free campaign faces first crunch moment\n\nReuters Ms Harris completely avoided the tough moments and scrutiny that comes with challenging for the Democratic nomination\n\nIn American politics it\u2019s customary to suggest that most voters don\u2019t start paying attention to the presidential election until after the Labor Day holiday weekend. Well, that occasion - seen here as the unofficial end of summer - has now been and gone. And as a noticeable chill is felt in the air, many more voters will start to take note of politics. That includes the crucial swing voters in a handful of closely contested states who will ultimately decide the race for the White House. Right on cue, as these eyes start to focus on the election, we have a presidential debate that will see Donald Trump and Kamala Harris go head-to-head for the first time. In fact, it will be the first time the two candidates have ever met in person. The high-stakes event in Philadelphia on Tuesday night is expected to draw in tens of millions of viewers. Many of these viewers will be getting a first look at Ms Harris beyond the comfort of a rally stage. Before she dramatically replaced Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket in July, Ms Harris\u2019s national profile was unusually low despite her serving as vice-president for almost four years. And make no mistake, her explosion on to the big stage so late in the election cycle is highly, highly unusual. The normal rhythms of American politics allow candidates to introduce themselves to the country as they campaign for their party\u2019s presidential nomination in primary contests held much earlier in the year. This process weeds out those who, while popular in their home states, are not ready or equipped to take the leap on to the national stage (see Ron DeSantis) and gives participants vital experience at campaigning and debating. Ms Harris did none of that this year. When she ran for the Democratic nomination in 2019, she pulled out before a single primary vote was cast after a campaign dogged by poor messaging, in which she struggled to sell her own vision. Yet, this time around, it appears that Ms Harris\u2019s unusual anonymity may in fact be a secret superpower.\n\nWatch: Why muted mics won\u2019t help Trump or Harris at debate.\n\nShe has been able to present herself to America on her own terms, highlighting her relatively humble background, her record as a prosecutor and her promise to uphold what she sees as fundamental rights such as access to abortion. Ms Harris has also positioned herself as the candidate of change - a fresh face for the future - even though she has been part of the current administration for almost four years. Trump is attacking her as a dangerously radical liberal. But to do so he is relying on statements she made and policies she promoted when she was competing in Democratic primaries in 2019. That\u2019s because, to win the Democratic nomination, candidates have to appeal to more liberal members of the party before then trying to move to the centre in the general election. In this election, Ms Harris did not have to compete against members of her own party to win the nomination and so had no reason to adopt more liberal policy positions as she did in the past. Just look at her failed bid in 2019, when she advocated for a ban on fracking and offshore drilling as well as universal free healthcare. Both ideas have been rapidly dropped this time around. Of course, we don\u2019t know what promises Ms Harris would have made in a 2024 primary process, but to win the support of progressives she may well have taken similar positions to the above that Trump would now be using to attack her. No primary contest means less ammunition for the former president. And relying on statements his opponent made five years ago, and policy positions she has since dropped, is blunting his attacks. This week, Ms Harris announced tax proposals that differentiate her platform from what President Biden was promising. She is calling for a lower tax hike than Mr Biden proposed on the investment earnings of Americans making more than $1 million a year. That is not the sort of idea that would have won her support in any Democratic primary vote. There are arguably downsides to entering the race at such a late stage, however. Competing for the nomination would have given Ms Harris more experience with unscripted appearances - press conferences, interviews and TV debates.\n\nMore on the US election\n\nSo far, she has done only one major broadcast interview since President Biden stepped aside and that was a joint appearance with her running mate Tim Walz. That encounter on CNN wasn\u2019t exactly a tough interrogation, and she still struggled to answer what she would do on day one of the job if elected. At her vast rallies and during her well-received speech at the Democratic National Convention last month, Ms Harris relied on a teleprompter and familiar lines. The 90-minute debate on Tuesday will be her longest unscripted appearance in this campaign. Trump, who is far more experienced on the presidential debate stage, will try to knock her off her prepared talking points and do what has yet to happen in the race: press Ms Harris aggressively on policy and her changing positions. And Ms Harris knows better than anyone that the last time Trump took to the debate stage his opponent ended up leaving the race. For America\u2019s surprise presidential candidate, who has completely avoided the challenges and scrutiny of a Democratic primary, this debate represents a sterner test than anything she has faced so far in this pain-free campaign.",

        "text": "Grinning Vladimir Putin suggests support for Kamala Harris as U.S. accuses Russia of election interference\nA grinning Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday that he supported Vice President Kamala Harris over former President Donald Trump in the upcoming U.S. presidential election. His remark came just hours after the Biden administration accused Russia of a widespread, sophisticated election interference campaign.\n\nTwo Russian women have been charged in an indictment unsealed in New York on Wednesday with funneling millions of dollars to a U.S. company that paid online influencers to push narratives favorable to the Kremlin.\n\n\"I said that our 'favorite,' if I may say so, was the incumbent President Mr. Biden. He was removed from the race, but he recommended that all his supporters support Ms. Harris. So we will do the same, we will support her,\" Putin said, smiling wryly at an economic forum in Vladivostok.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin applauds during the plenary session of the Eastern Economic Forum 2024, Sept. 5, 2024, in Vladivostok, Russia. Getty\n\n\"She laughs so expressively and infectiously that it means that everything is fine with her. And if everything is fine with her \u2014 then Trump has introduced so many restrictions and sanctions against Russia that no president has ever introduced before \u2014 and if everything is fine with Ms. Harris, then maybe she will refrain from such actions of this kind,\" Putin continued in what appeared to be a sarcastic tone.\n\nKeir Giles, an expert on Russia at the Chatham House think tank and author of the book \"Russia's War on Everybody,\" told CBS News that Putin's facial expression was characteristic of the Russian leader.\n\n\"It's not surprising that Putin said this with a smirk on his face, that is what he tends to do when engaging in the most blatant and overt trolling of American audiences,\" Giles said. \"It is a burst of trolling, and he's done it before. We had the same excited reaction from some sections of U.S. and international media when he previously endorsed Biden, but of course it is meaningless. There is a clear preference from Russia because there is only one presidential candidate that is so much in favor of Russian interests and would be so inclined to pander to what Russia wants from Ukraine, from Europe, form the world and from the United States,\" Giles said, referring to former President Trump.\n\n\"Far more significant is this start, and hopefully it is just the start, of the U.S. Department of Justice starting to roll up the networks of influencers who have been operating on behalf of Russia to try to sway public opinion in the United States towards Russia's desired political outcome,\" Giles told CBS News.\n\nThe Biden administration accused Russia on Wednesday of attempting to interfere in the November election, including by creating fake news sites designed to covertly spread Russian propoganda among Americans.\n\nAt a meeting of the Election Threats Task Force, which included FBI Director Chris Wray and other top officials in the Justice Department, Attorney General Merrick Garland said Russia Today, known as RT, a media outlet funded by the Russian state, had implemented a scheme to fund a Tennessee-based company to create and disseminate content that was consistent with Russia's goals of pushing division within U.S. society and undermining support for Ukraine.\n\nGarland said the Justice Department had seized 32 internet domains that pro-Russian actors and the Russian government had used to engage in a \"covert campaign to interfere and influence the outcome of our country's elections.\"\n\n\"This is deadly serious and we are going to treat it accordingly,\" Garland said.\n\nAccording to documents submitted by the Justice Department, one of the Russian campaigns, called the \"Good Old USA Project,\" aimed to reduce President Biden's confidence rating among Americans before he dropped his reelection bid. The document appeared to have been prepared in late 2023.\n\nTargets for the propaganda included residents of \"conservative states where traditional values are strong who more often vote for candidates of\" an unidentified political party. Though redacted, the document appears to refer to the Republican Party.\n\nDocuments about another Russian campaign, called the \"U.S. Social Media Influencers Project,\" described the Republican Party as \"currently advancing a relatively pro-Russian agenda\" that can be \"exploited by posing as ardent [Republicans] and relaying the part of their agenda that coincides with ours.\"\n\nIn July, U.S. officials with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security indicated that Russia was working to boost Trump's candidacy in this election cycle, as it did in 2016 and 2020, though they did not directly name his campaign.\n\n\"We have not observed a shift in Russia's preferences for the presidential race from past elections, given the role the U.S. is playing with regard to Ukraine and broader policy towards Russia,\" an ODNI official said in a July 9 election security update.\n\n, , , and contributed to this report.",

        "text": "2024 Election Insights\nWhat is at stake in the Electoral College and Congress?\n\nThe presidential race will captivate voters most, but critical to a president\u2019s success in implementing their agenda is the configuration of Congress, comprised of the Senate and House of Representatives. Here is what\u2019s at stake, and the paths to victory for each:\n\nElectoral College\n\nThe outcome of the 2024 US presidential elections will likely come down to just a few thousand votes in a few pivotal swing states, mirroring the close outcomes of 2016 and 2020. There are 538 electoral college votes available, and 270 are required to win. Most election experts have distilled this race to 7 battleground states, where the margin of victory is expected to be fewer than 500k votes. Those key battleground states are Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.\n\nIn 2020, President Biden won the election with 306 votes, 74 more than former President Trump who earned 232 votes and 36 more than the 270 required to win. Although 36 votes may seem like a significant gap, in 2020, three states (GA, AZ, WI) accounting for 37 electoral college votes were determined by under 43,000 individual votes. Several races were called days after the election, and five races had less than a 2% spread of vots between candidates -- GA, AZ, WI, PA (won by Biden) and NC (won by Trump).\n\nSenate\n\nThe Senate currently consists of 48 Democrats, 49 Republicans, and 3 Independents that typically vote with the Democrats (ME, AZ, VT). There are 100 seats in the Senate and Senators serve staggered 6-year terms, so every two years, about one-third of the Senate is up for election. In 2024, 34 seats are up for election, 23 currently held by Democrats and 11 held by Republicans.\n\nAccording to The Cook Political Report, there are three toss-up states, all currently held by Democrats: Nevada, held by Jacky Rosen; Ohio, held by Sherrod Brown; and Montana, held by Jon Tester. Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia will not run again, so that seat is very likely to flip to the Republican party. The Republicans need two seats to control the Senate, or just one if they also win the White House as the vice president casts tie-breaking votes. Therefore, there is not much ground for Democrats to gain, and they are at risk of losing their slim majority.\n\nHouse of Representatives\n\nAll 435 seats in the House of Representatives are up for election every two years. The House currently consists of 220 Republicans, 212 Democrats and 3 vacant seats due to retirement. The Democrats would need to win 5 seats to take control of the House. According to Ballotpedia, there are 52 battleground districts, accounting for 13.1% of House races.",

        "text": "Election 2024: The United States Has a Debt Problem\nThe U.S. government is addicted to deficits and debt. The last time the federal government ran a budget surplus\u2014that is, tax revenue coming into the U.S. Treasury exceeding money going out to pay expenses\u2014was 2001. Even that black ink was an anomaly. Washington has run a budget surplus only four times in the past half century.\n\nThe inevitable consequence of repeated government deficits is a growing national debt. The U.S. national debt now tops $35 trillion. That equates to nearly $105,000 for every man, woman, and child living in the United States. Put differently, the national debt is now as large as the entire U.S. economy. The last time the U.S. national debt was this large relative to the U.S. economy was at the end of World War II when the United States borrowed heavily to finance the existential fight against Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan.\n\nWhat is striking about America\u2019s debt today is how fast it has accumulated. Just fifteen years ago, the U.S. national debt was only about half the size of the U.S. economy. Under Donald Trump, the U.S. national debt grew by nearly $8 trillion, or roughly 25 percent of the debt the United States accumulated during its first 227 years of existence.\n\nThe Water's Edge James M.

The federal government\u2019s budget deficit for fiscal year (FY) 2023 was $1.7 trillion. The budget deficit for FY 2024, which ends in just twenty-four days, is estimated to be $1.9 trillion. In the absence of major changes in U.S. fiscal policy\u2014that is, what the U.S. government spends and taxes\u2014the debt picture will only worsen. The U.S. government is headed toward a national debt in thirty years that equals 166 percent of the U.S. economy.\n\nThe current U.S. economic boom would seem to be the ideal time to shore up America\u2019s fiscal foundation. The reason is simple. Recessions mean more red ink as tax receipts fall and spending grows to stimulate the contracting economy.\n\nThe United States, however, shows no signs of embracing fiscal rectitude. It\u2019s certainly not an issue on the campaign trail. In fact, the opposite is the case. Economists at the University of Pennsylvania project that Donald Trump\u2019s proposed tax and spending plans would add $4.1 trillion to the debt over a decade. The comparable number for Kamala Harris is smaller but not small: $2 trillion.\n\nDoes any of this matter? Skeptics will point out that deficit hawks have been warning about a debt Armageddon for decades. Despite the finger-wagging, the U.S. economy remains the envy of the world and the U.S. stock market keeps hitting all-time highs. As Alfred E. Neuman might say, \u201cWhat, me worry?\u201d\n\nThe problem with the Alfred E. Neuman school of deficit thinking is that you only know you have overdone something by overdoing it. At that point the fixes won\u2019t be easy or painless. To the contrary, they will be hard and painful.\n\nEven now the pain points are easy to see. Borrowed money needs to be repaid. The United States is now paying back its lenders to the tune of more than $2 billion a day. That might not seem like much. But it means that the United States now spends more on interest on its debt each year than it spends on defense.\n\nEven if defense spending isn\u2019t your favorite federal government expenditure, the general lesson remains the same. Money spent on interest is money that can\u2019t be spent to educate children, support cutting-edge research, or invest in the infrastructure needed to keep the U.S. economy world class.\n\nThe scant talk on the campaign trail of debt and deficits makes political sense. Both Harris and Trump want to focus on what they will deliver for voters rather than what they will take away. But their success in ignoring the fiscal math for the moment could provide cold comfort down the road. Whoever wins in November might discover that a flood of red ink will derail much of what they hope to accomplish once they sit in the Oval Office.\n\nCampaign Update\n\nThe much-anticipated Harris-Trump debate is now just four days away. After much sparring, the two sides have agreed on the ground rules for the ninety-minute faceoff, which will be held at Philadelphia\u2019s National Constitution Center and be broadcast on ABC. The Harris campaign folded on its demand that both candidates have live mics throughout the debate, while arguing that the decision \u201cwill serve to shield Donald Trump from direct exchanges with the Vice President.\u201d Like the June 27 meeting between Joe Biden and Trump, no audience will be present. David Muir and Linsey Davis will moderate the debate, which will have two commercial breaks.\n\nTrump won an important legal victory earlier today. Judge Juan Merchan agreed to postpone the former president\u2019s sentencing on his felony convictions in the New York hush money case until after Election Day. Merchan wrote that Trump\u2019s legal situation \u201cis one that stands alone, in a unique place in this Nation's history\u201d and that \u201cthis is not a decision this Court makes lightly but it is the decision which in this Court's view, best advances the interests of justice.\u201d Trump\u2019s new sentencing date is November 26.\n\nTrump had less success this week in his effort to delay action on the criminal charges he faces in the January 6 case. Federal District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan yesterday directed the office of Special Prosecutor Jack Smith to submit a brief by September 26 on how the government\u2019s revised indictment charging Trump with seeking to overthrow the 2020 election accommodates the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling this summer on presidential immunity. Chutkan gave Trump\u2019s lawyers until October 17 to respond to the government\u2019s brief. They had asked that the submission of the government\u2019s brief be delayed until December to avoid revealing any information that could damage Trump\u2019s candidacy. Chutkan responded that the timing of the election was \u201cnot relevant\u201d to the court\u2019s proceedings.\n\nThe Department of Justice on Wednesday unsealed an indictment in the Southern District of New York alleging that an unnamed U.S. company accepted nearly $10 million dollars from a Russian source to promote Russian propaganda in the United States. The firm in question was subsequently identified as Tenet Media, a right-wing organization that describes itself as featuring a \u201cnetwork of heterodox commentators that focus on Western political and cultural issues.\u201d YouTube subsequently terminated channels associated with Tenet Media and its founders. The criminal charges filed in New York were part of a larger effort, which included sanctions on Russian organizations and the seizure of more than thirty internet domains, to curb Russian interference in the U.S. election.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. has sued to get his name off the ballot in Wisconsin. The crux of Kennedy\u2019s legal challenge is that the state\u2019s rules for withdrawing from a race differ for third-party candidates. Democratic and Republican candidates have until the first Tuesday in September to withdraw, while third-party candidates must do so by early August. On Tuesday, a Michigan judge dismissed a lawsuit Kennedy filed to get off the ballot in Michigan.\n\nJen O\u2019Malley, chair of the Harris-Walz campaign, released a memo last Saturday that sought to lance any overconfidence that might be building among Democrats given how well things have gone for Harris since she entered the race. O\u2019Malley wrote that \u201cwe head into the final stretch of this race as the clear underdogs\u201d and noted that the 2020 election \u201ccame down to about 40,000 votes across the battleground states.\u201d Polls back up her caution\u2014Harris is behind where Biden stood four years ago with a range of demographic groups. O\u2019Malley did point to one weakness she sees in Trump\u2019s campaign: it \u201cstill lags far behind in the infrastructure needed to win in key battleground states.\u201d That edge might persist. Contributions to the Harris-Waltz campaign last month were double those to the Trump-Vance campaign.\n\nWhat the Candidates Are Saying\n\nTrump addressed the Economic Club in New York yesterday. In response to a question about how he would lower the cost of childcare, he argued that the answer lies in raising tariffs. In his view, the United States would take in so much money by building a tariff wall that \u201cwe\u2019re going to make this into an incredible country that can afford to take care of its people.\u201d\n\nTrump went even further to argue that the tariffs he intends to impose will mean that the United States will have \u201cno deficits in a fairly short period of time.\u201d In making these claims, Trump once again said that tariffs are taxes on foreign countries. They aren\u2019t. They are taxes paid by U.S. importers. Economists at Goldman Sachs this week wrote that Trump\u2019s tariff plans would actually slow U.S. economic growth.\n\nAt a campaign event in Pittsburgh on Labor Day, Harris sided with the United Steelworkers union and declared that US Steel \u201cshould remain American-owned and American-operated.\u201d\n\nJapan\u2019s Nippon Steel agreed last December to buy U.S. Steel, which has been struggling to succeed in a fiercely competitive global market. Steelworkers and many local politicians have adamantly opposed the sale, even though Nippon Steel has promised to invest $2.7 billion in modernizing U.S. Steel\u2019s facilities, and U.S. Steel executives have warned of job losses if the deal doesn\u2019t go through. Harris likely won\u2019t get to decide whether the deal goes through or not. Biden appears poised to kill the deal on national security grounds.\n\nWhat the Pundits Are Saying\n\nThe New York Times\u2019s Nick Corasaniti explored the many legal challenges likely to unfold before and after Election Day. He notes that lawsuits will be filed in states across the country because each state has its own rules governing elections. \u201cBut the likeliest source of trouble at the moment is Georgia, which embodies Republicans\u2019 two-pronged approach: They\u2019ve set up new hurdles to voting and a process to stall\u2014or even outright avoid\u2014certifying the results if Trump loses. (In certification, local election officials are like scorekeepers at a football game, tallying up the points from each quarter to make a final, official score.)\u201d\n\nThe Campaign Schedule\n\nThe second presidential debate is next Tuesday night (September 10, 2024).\n\nNorth Carolina began sending mail-in ballots today to all voters who request them. Pennsylvania will allow voters to request mail-in ballots in ten days (September 16, 2024).\n\nThe first in-person absentee voting in the nation begins in Minnesota and South Dakota in two weeks (September 20, 2024).\n\nElection Day is sixty days away (November 5, 2024).\n\nInauguration Day is 136 days away (January 20, 2025).\n\nShelby Sires assisted in the preparation of this post.",

        "text": "Vladimir Putin claims he wants 'infectious' Kamala Harris to win US election over Donald Trump\nVladimir Putin has made a surprising endorsement for who he wants to win the 2024 US election.\n\nThe Russian president has long been considered friendlier with this year's Republican nominee Donald Trump, with the former president calling Mr Putin a \"genius\" early in 2022.\n\nBut speaking at the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok, he said Kamala Harris was Russia's preferred choice for the next US president.\n\nFollow the latest on the Ukraine war\n\nWhen asked how he feels about the November election, the Russian leader said that as President Joe Biden had recommended his supporters to back Ms Harris, \"we will do the same, we will support her\".\n\n\"She laughs so expressively and infectiously that it means that everything is fine with her,\" Mr Putin said with a smile before suggesting this could mean she would refrain from further sanctions against Russia.\n\nPutin is mischief-making when he claims he wants Harris to win Ivor Bennett Moscow correspondent @IvorBennett So, the Kremlin backs Kamala, apparently\u2026 Why? Because of her \"infectious\" laugh. Safe to say, Vladimir Putin is having a little chuckle himself here. His comments are almost certainly more mischief-making than a statement of fact because, as we know, Russia's president doesn't always say what he thinks. So why would he say this? With relations between Moscow and Washington as bad as they are, he will know that any endorsement of a candidate might actually harm their chances come November, rather than improve them. So that might well be what Vladimir Putin is trying to do here, hoping instead that Donald Trump takes power. And why would he want that? Because in all likelihood, it would mean a cut to US aid to Ukraine, which in turn would significantly boost Russia's prospects on the battlefield.

        "text": "Donald Trump criminal sentencing delayed until after election\nIn his decision, Judge Merchan wrote that the case demands \"a sentencing hearing that is entirely focused on the verdict of the jury\".\n\n\"Their verdict must be respected and addressed in a manner that is not diluted by the enormity of the upcoming presidential election,\" he said, setting sentencing to exactly three weeks after the 5 November election.\n\nHe said the delay was necessary \"to avoid any appearance - however unwarranted - that the proceeding has been affected by or seeks to affect the approaching presidential election in which the Defendant is a candidate\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Court is a fair, impartial and apolitical institution,\u201d the judge continued.\n\nTrump could face a sentence of up to four years in prison, but Judge Merchan also has the discretion to impose a punishment of a fine, probation or a shorter jail term.\n\nProsecutors in the case accused the former president of concealing a payment to buy the silence of Stormy Daniels, a former adult-film star, in the final days of his 2016 election campaign.\n\nMs Daniels testified that she and Trump had sex, and that she accepted $130,000 (\u00a399,000) from his former lawyer before the 2016 election in exchange to keep quiet about the encounter.\n\nProsecutors argued that, by approving a scheme to disguise the money as legal expenses, Trump broke the law.\n\nA jury found him guilty on all counts.\n\nTrump's original sentencing date was in July. His lawyers delayed that after a US Supreme Court ruling that granted presidents some immunity from criminal prosecution for \"official acts\".\n\nJudge Merchan granted a delay so that the parties could prepare arguments on the effects of the Supreme Court ruling on his case.\n\nA decision on the implications will come on 12 November.\n\nJudge Merchan has already dismissed some arguments made by Trump's lawyers to delay as \"unsubstantiated grievances... that do not merit this Court's attention\".\n\nBut he wrote that sentencing hearings are routinely delayed in other cases for reasons like personal circumstances or scheduling conflicts.\n\n\"Given the unique facts and circumstances of this case, there is no reason why this Defendant should be treated differently than any other,\" Judge Merchan said.\n\nHe added that his decision to delay \"should dispel any suggestion\" that the court would have made a decision that would be seen in support of \"any political party or any candidate for any office\".\n\nTrump has maintained that he did nothing wrong. He told Fox News after the ruling that the \"case should be dead\".\n\nOn his social media platform Truth Social, the former president re-iterated his claims of innocence, dismissing the case as a \"witch hunt\" and a \"political attack\".\n\n\"This case should be rightfully terminated, as we prepare for the Most Important Election in the History of our Country,\" he wrote.\n\nA spokesperson for Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney whose office brought the charges, said his team was \"ready for sentencing on the new date set by the court\".\n\nIf Trump is re-elected US president, he could order the Justice Department to drop the ongoing federal cases against him.\n\nHowever, this case in New York - as well as the election interference case in Georgia - involved state charges, and a president would not have the authority to interfere.",

        "text": "Fake news, social media, and \"The Death of Truth\"\nWe live in an age of alternate facts. More and more Americans are getting their information almost entirely from outlets that echo their own political point of view. And then, of course, there's social media, where there are few (if any) filters between users and a wide world of misinformation.\n\nFor example: On July 13 a sniper came within inches of assassinating Donald Trump as he addressed an outdoor rally in Pennsylvania. Within minutes, social media was alive with uninformed speculation. One woman posted, \"Who did it? I bet you it was the government themselves. They're all on the same side.\"\n\nKoppel said, \"We have no idea who she is, she has no particular credibility. Why should I even care that she is out there?\"\n\n\"Because she could potentially have an audience,\" said journalist and author Steven Brill. \"If the algorithm gives it steam, that could be seen by millions of people.\"\n\nAnd then on X (formerly Twitter), this message: \"You're telling me the Secret Service let a guy climb up on a roof with a rifle only 150 yards from Trump? Inside job.\" That message has seven million views and counting.\n\nBrill said, \"We're at a point where nobody believes anything. Truth as a concept is really in trouble. It's suspect.\"\n\nThe cumulative impact of the lies and distortions just keeps growing, such that Brill titled his new book \"The Death of Truth.\" \"There are facts,\" he said, \"and it used to be in this world that people could at least agree on the same set of facts and then they could debate what to do about those facts.\"\n\nKnopf\n\nBut we're losing our grip on any sort of shared reality. Brill's company, NewsGuard, is attempting to put the brakes on. Its 40 or so staffers around the world identify and rate the credibility of online news and information sources.\n\nIt's a finger in the dike, because there's no price to be paid. Almost 30 years ago, the federal government decided that internet platforms were like the phone company. You can't sue the phone company for what a caller might say in a phone conversation.\n\nBrill said, \"They inserted a three-paragraph section called Section 230, which said that these [internet] publishers would not be responsible for anything that was published in their chat rooms.\"\n\nInstead, it left the internet essentially without any enforceable rules. Social media companies exercise only limited control, permitting lies, fake news and intentionally divisive content to proliferate.\n\nThe torrent of allegedly Moscow-backed content provoked an angry reaction from the U.S. this past week.\n\nIn an indictment unsealed on Wednesday, the Department of Justice alleged that Russian nationals funneled millions of dollars to an American media company that paid right-wing influencers for videos pushing narratives favorable to the Kremlin. The Biden administration also accused Russia of using fake news sites designed to covertly spread Russian propaganda in an attempt to interfere with the 2024 U.S. presidential election. CBS News\n\nBut most of the damage is home-grown, from national and supposedly local outlets. \"There are more fake news sites posing as legitimate local news in the United States than there are news sites of legitimate local newspapers,\" said Brill. \"There is no monopoly on virtue from either side here. Just to take an example, the most effective fake local news sites are financed by liberal political action committees. And they're sort of especially self-righteous about it. When I interviewed them, they basically said, 'Well, the other guys do it, so we'll do it.' But it's undermining democracy.\"\n\nAnd then, Brill points out, we're just beginning to come to terms with the full potential of artificial intelligence. Note that none of these images is real:\n\nFake images of Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris that have been shared on social media. CBS News\n\nBrill said, \"It disorients everything, because you don't know if something is a hoax, or is political propaganda, or is a deep fake. You just don't know what to believe.\"\n\nKoppel asked, \"In the environment you describe, is it possible for us to have a clean, fair, universally-acceptable election?\"\n\n\"Your last condition is the one that is, I think, impossible \u2013 universally acceptable,\" Brill replied. \"Forget universally, even modestly acceptable. I have a real fear that one way or another, regardless of the outcome, that the chaos and the disbelief and anger that's going to prevail on November 6, the day after the election, is really going to put our country to the test.\"\n\n\n\nREAD AN EXCERPT: \"The Death of Truth\" by Steven Brill\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\n\n\nStory produced by Dustin Stephens.

        "text": "Kamala Harris has thrived in debates - will her tactics work on Trump?\nKamala Harris has thrived in debates - will her tactics work on Trump?\n\nGetty Images\n\nDuring a pivotal debate in the 2020 US presidential election, one candidate seemed to dominate the stage. They interrupted their rivals at strategic moments, sometimes speaking over them. They directly confronted an opponent, Joe Biden, generating headlines for days and had critics questioning whether they had breached some sort of unspoken political decorum. That candidate, however, wasn\u2019t Donald Trump. It was Kamala Harris. On 10 September, Ms Harris will once again take to the debate stage. But this time, having gone one step further than 2020 by becoming the Democratic candidate for president, she will face Trump in a showdown that poses the toughest challenge of her campaign so far. Debates have played a major role in Ms Harris\u2019s political career, from her run for California attorney general to her ascent to the vice-presidency. In watching four of her key debates back, it is clear that Ms Harris knows when to seize the spotlight, but also when to stand by as a rival administers a self-inflicted blow. Ms Harris will be hoping to utilise these instincts against the notoriously combative Trump. Her campaign will also want to dispel longstanding concerns about her political messaging skills that began with her failed run for the White House in 2020, and were only heightened by her fumbling some interviews in recent years. There is no room for error given how these events are defined by viral clips, so it is just as important for the Harris campaign that she avoids stumbling as it is for her to land a highlight-reel blow. \u201cShe needs to hold her own,\u201d said Aimee Allison, founder of She The People, an organisation that supports women of colour in politics. \u201cAnd she needs to communicate on the debate stage what she\u2019s fighting for.\"\n\nGetty Images Debates have played a key role in Ms Harris's career - in 2003 she took on Terrence Hallinan in the San Francisco District Attorney race\n\nWatch on BBC iPlayer (UK Only) Who Is Kamala Harris?\n\nIn her earliest debate appearances, Ms Harris found success by letting her opponents dismantle themselves. In a 2010 debate for the position of California attorney general, moderators asked Ms Harris and her Republican opponent Steve Cooley about a controversial practice known as double-dipping, which allows a public official to draw from their government salary as well as a pension. \u201cDo you plan to double-dip by taking both a pension and your salary as attorney general?\u201d a moderator asked the candidates. \u201cYes, I do,\u201d Mr Cooley replied. \u201cI earned it.\u201d For a while, Ms Harris said nothing as he defended his position. \u201cGo for it, Steve,\u201d she eventually retorted. \u201cYou earned it!\u201d Ms Harris\u2019s campaign swifty cut the moment into an advertisement they used to hammer Mr Cooley as out of touch. She won the election by a razor-thin margin. And during a 2016 debate for a California US Senate seat, Ms Harris\u2019s opponent inexplicably punctuated her closing statement with a dab \u2013 a dance move that was popular at the time. Ms Harris, who looked taken aback, waited a few beats before quipping: \u201cSo, there\u2019s a clear difference between the candidates in this race.\u201d Voters again backed Ms Harris. Both examples demonstrate Ms Harris\u2019s eye for opportunity on the debate stage, as well as a sense for knowing when it is best to step back. \u201cI think she is someone who uses silence incredibly well,\u201d said Maya Rupert, a Democratic strategist who worked on Juli\u00e1n Castro and Elizabeth Warren\u2019s 2020 presidential campaigns.\n\nWatch: Assessing both candidates' strengths and weaknesses in debates\n\nAs she entered the national stage, Ms Harris proved adept at claiming the floor for herself, even amid a crowded field. One of her tried-and-tested tactics involves openly declaring her intention to speak, compelling her opponents \u2013 and the audience \u2013 to listen. The 2020 vice-presidential debate is remembered primarily for one line she directed at Mike Pence as he began to interrupt: \u201cMr Vice-President, I\u2019m speaking.\u201d And just weeks ago - illustrating that the riposte was more than a one-off - Ms Harris used the same line on Gaza protesters who interrupted her rally in Detroit. \u201cI\u2019m speaking now,\u201d she told them. \u201cIf you want Donald Trump to win, then say that. Otherwise, I\u2019m speaking.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s using something that a lot of black women have used effectively, which is to insist on their time, and to insist to be heard,\u201d said Ms Allison. \u201cShe\u2019s very effective in making sure that she is heard, and respected.\u201d\n\nMore on US election\n\nBut perhaps her most memorable debate moment came in 2019, when Ms Harris, then a US senator, stopped all crosstalk during the Democratic primary debate in Miami to challenge Mr Biden over his past position on a policy known as bussing. She criticised Mr Biden for working with lawmakers who opposed the Civil Rights Era policy of transporting students to schools in different neighbourhoods in an effort to address racial segregation. \u201cThere was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bussed to school every day,\u201d Ms Harris said. She paused for effect before telling Mr Biden: \u201cAnd that little girl was me.\u201d Nina Smith, who was the travelling press secretary for presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg at the time, said the moment made rival campaigns sit up and pay attention. \u201cWhat it showed us as a team is if she sees an opening she\u2019s going to go after it,\u201d Ms Smith recalled to the BBC. \u201cI think it made her a rather skilled debater in that regard. It\u2019s definitely something we watched out for, any sort of unexpected punch that could come from Senator Harris at the time.\u201d \u201cIt showed that prosecutorial ability\u2026 to really highlight weaknesses in her opponents,\u201d she said. By the end of the debate, Ms Harris had spoken more than any other candidate except Mr Biden. Her campaign announced it raised $2 million in 24 hours after the debate. But despite the breakthrough moment and subsequent surge in the polls, Ms Harris later struggled to articulate her own position on bussing. It only served to underscore the concerns with her messaging and ability to articulate a consistent policy position. The episode was one of many messaging stumbles Ms Harris made that ultimately sank her first presidential bid. Her failure to articulate a consistent policy agenda was one of the most common reasons cited, and it is an issue she needs to clarify quickly at the debate when she will almost certainly be pressed on policy specifics.\n\nThe highest stakes yet\n\nRepublicans have circulated clips of Ms Harris\u2019 public remarks for years to ridicule her speaking style and cast her as inept. She has used verbose phrases when speaking off the cuff, and while a few turns of phrase have been embraced by her supporters, opponents have often criticised her for a lack of clarity. In a recent CNN interview, her first since becoming the nominee, she gave an answer on climate change which illustrated the issue. \u201cIt is an urgent matter to which we should apply metrics that include holding ourselves to deadlines around time,\u201d Ms Harris said. On a debate stage, however, speaking time is limited and clarity of message is crucial. The looming debate on ABC News will be her biggest chance yet to reset public opinion, and past debates show that Ms Harris often brings a sharp toolkit to these events and is able to land blows. But the pressure of those past debates will pale in comparison to the stakes when she comes face-to-face with Trump for the first time. Even for the most experienced politicians, Trump presents a formidable challenge, the strategists agreed. In a 2016 debate against his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, he famously stalked her around the stage, drawing all attention to him even when it was her turn to answer.\n\nHillary Clinton: 'My skin crawled' in Trump debate\n\nHis first 2020 presidential debate against Mr Biden devolved into an unintelligible melee when Trump kept interrupting. At one point, Mr Biden grew so irritated he snapped: \u201cWill you shut up, man?\u201d \u201cDonald Trump is a unique and special case in that you never really know what\u2019s coming,\u201d said Ms Smith, who has prepared Democratic candidates for debates. \u201cDuring debate prep, I would not allow her to get comfortable, in order for her to develop some sort of instinct, or callousness, to anything that could come up.\u201d Ms Harris, a former prosecutor, is skilled at back-and-forth exchanges on the debate stage. It is something she has also demonstrated during heated Senate hearings when she has grilled Trump officials and Supreme Court nominees. But the format of the upcoming ABC debate may limit her ability to flex her prosecutorial skills, as the microphones will reportedly be muted when it is the other person\u2019s turn to speak. This likely means, based on the Biden-Trump debate in June which had the same rules, that she will be fielding tricky questions from moderators as opposed to clashing with Trump. And when Ms Harris is on the end of prosecutorial questions, as opposed to giving them, she has floundered in the past, such as in a notorious 2021 interview with NBC News\u2019 Lester Holt in which she struggled when pressed on the issue of illegal immigration. One pitfall that Ms Rupert could envision for the Harris camp is their candidate being drawn into a lengthy debate over facts with Trump. That could muddle the debate for voters, and leave viewers with an impression that he has dominated the conversation. She suggested a third tactic for Ms Harris to add to her arsenal \u2013 not to prosecute, or remain silent, but to ignore. \u201cShe has an important opportunity here to get her point across,\u201d Ms Rupert said, \u201cAnd not be overly burdened by what he is doing next to her.\u201d",

        "text": "Ask an expert: American workers, labor unions and the 2024 presidential election\nUNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. \u2014 The latest jobs report issued on Sept. 6 by the Labor Department suggests the labor market is still growing, but at a slower pace. Americans will be watching the Federal Reserve to see how much it slashes interest rates this month, and politicians will have their eyes on American workers, hoping to court their votes in November.\n\nPenn State News spoke with Paul Clark, professor of labor and employment relations, to see how the labor market, unions and American workers may affect the results of the presidential election.\n\nQ: How have recent economic conditions impacted American workers and their unions?\n\nClark: The COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 years have seen a tightening of the labor market as unemployment fell and the demand for workers was greater than the supply. When employers cannot find workers to fill their job openings, this significantly increases unions\u2019 bargaining power. Workers are more willing to risk their jobs and go on strike when there are no spare workers to replace them. And because there are few to no replacement workers available, employers cannot continue to operate when their workers strike. This increases the cost of a strike for a company and reduces the time they can hold out when one occurs. In addition, employers are more willing to grant larger wage increases because they realize this is something they would need to do anyway to attract new hires. Tight labor markets like the ones we have seen since COVID are unusual and are one of the key reasons why American unions and American workers have made great gains in recent years.\n\nQ: Why do unions get involved in elections?\n\nClark: Unions exist to improve the pay, benefits and working conditions of their members. They do this in two ways. The first is by engaging in collective bargaining with their members\u2019 employers. The second is by advocating for their members\u2019 interests in the political and legislative processes. The actions of national and state governments can directly impact union members in many ways. They can pass laws or establish regulations that protect their rights to organize, bargain and strike; that make their workplaces safer and healthier; and that ensure their employer cannot discriminate against them on a number of grounds. Governments can provide incentives and tax breaks that boost the industries in which union members work. Or they can refrain from passing such legislation and establishing such policies.\n\nUnions advocate for their members\u2019 interests in the political arena by lobbying elected officials on issues related to work, employment and labor-management relations. They also work to further their members\u2019 interests by helping supportive political candidates get elected. Towards this end, unions endorse candidates they believe will vote for pro-union and pro-worker legislation and policies. They strongly encourage their members and their families to vote for these candidates. And they are very effective at mobilizing their members to do grassroots election work like staffing phone banks, knocking on doors and getting out the vote.\n\nQ: Who do labor unions support politically and has there been a shift in recent years?\n\nClark: Unions have long aligned themselves with the Democratic Party because Democrats have historically been more sympathetic towards, and supportive of, the interests of unions and their members. On the other hand, the Republican Party has traditionally been more supportive of the interests of the business community. In 2020, only a handful of national unions endorsed Donald Trump, while the vast majority endorsed Joe Biden. That will likely be the case in 2024. However, union members do not vote as a solid bloc. While a majority of union members are Democrats, a significant percentage are registered Republicans. In some unions, Republicans may represent a small minority of members; in others they may make up to 50% or more of the membership.\n\nQ: Will unions play an important role in the 2024 election?\n\nClark: I believe unions and union members will play a critical role in the 2024 election. In the last two presidential elections, Donald Trump has successfully drawn working class voters, including union members, away from the Democratic Party. While almost 60% of union members and their families voted for the Democratic presidential candidate in 2012, that number fell to 51% in 2016, enough to secure Trump\u2019s election. Due to a concerted effort on the part of unions, that number rose to 56% in 2020, ostensibly enough to put Joe Biden in the White House. Again, in 2024 the presidential election is expected to be a very close race. If unions can keep member support for the Democratic presidential nominee at the 2020 level, 56% or more, they could deliver the presidency to Kamala Harris. However, if Trump can convince enough union members to disregard their union\u2019s endorsement and vote for him, as he did in 2016, that could decide the election in his favor. Unions, as well as both the Harris and Trump campaigns, know this and they will all make winning union members\u2019 votes a top priority.",

        "text": "Election forecast tracks a tight presidential race\nFor the second U.S. presidential election in a row, a Northwestern University data scientist is running a novel forecasting platform that updates the odds of a win by former President Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris each day.\n\nWith this level of precision, followers can see how single events \u2014 such as a debate, campaign activities or legal rulings \u2014 might affect the potential outcome of the U.S. presidential election.\n\nA betting market isn\u2019t asking people to give an opinion ... but to put their money down.\u201d Thomas Miller\n\nData scientist\n\n\u201cTomorrow\u2019s debate is critical,\u201d said Northwestern\u2019s Thomas Miller, who developed the platform. \u201cTrump\u2019s legal events also are critical. There have been massive changes in forecasted Electoral College votes in recent months associated with current events and campaign activities.\u201d\n\nMiller is the faculty director of the master\u2019s in data science program at Northwestern\u2019s School of Professional Studies.\n\nViewers can follow his daily predictions and accompanying analysis on his site, The Virtual Tout.\n\nThis platform follows the money\n\nMiller\u2019s system uses data from PredictIt, prediction markets in which users bet real money on political races. He then uses pricing data as input to his forecast for how the Electoral College will vote.\n\nUsing his daily forecasts, Miller can gauge responses to singular news or campaign events. When Trump received a sentencing delay for his New York \u201chush money\u201d conviction, for example, Harris\u2019s campaign experienced a predicted drop of 68 forecasted electoral votes, according to Miller\u2019s model.\n\nAs of the time of this article, Miller\u2019s system predicts the Harris-Walz ticket will win the November election with 289 electoral votes. Candidates need 270 votes to win the presidency.\n\nMiller was nearly perfect in 2020\n\nMiller\u2019s models proved their uncanny accuracy during the 2020 presidential election \u2014 only predicting one state (Georgia) incorrectly. Miller has since learned from this error, uncovering innate biases that led to a Democratic Electoral College vote prediction that was 12 votes lower than the actual Electoral College vote.\n\n\u201cIn 2020, I was wrong on Georgia because I did not account for the Republican bias in prediction markets,\u201d Miller said. \u201cI have the data from the 2020 election to gauge the degree of bias in prediction markets and to correct for that bias, if necessary.\u201d\n\nRegardless of the incorrect prediction for Georgia, Miller\u2019s 2020 model was still more accurate than Nate Silver\u2019s FiveThirtyEight. While FiveThirtyEight predicted 348 electoral votes for Biden-Harris, Miller predicted 294 electoral votes for the Democratic ticket. Ultimately, the Electoral College casted 306 votes for Biden-Harris.\n\nMarkets are better than polls for a few reasons\n\nMiller says popular election forecasting systems, including FiveThirtyEight and The Economist\u2019s predictions project, are inherently flawed because they use data from opinion polls. According to Miller, these data are old, compared to fast-moving news cycles.\n\nMiller also notes another key advantage of prediction markets over political polls: Large groups of investors who stay in the markets until Election Day. These groups grow larger as Election Day approaches. Miller relies on prediction markets that have tens of thousands of investors, with thousands of shares traded each day. Typical opinion polls involve between one and two thousand respondents, with new respondents recruited for each poll.\n\n\u201cPrediction markets are more reliable than pollsters and pundits,\u201d Miller said. \u201cA betting market isn\u2019t asking people to give an opinion or preference but to put their money down. When you put your money down, you believe what you are betting on. You might not like the outcome, but you believe it will happen.\u201d",

        "text": "Harris and Trump to debate in pivotal campaign test\nHarris and Trump to debate in pivotal campaign test\n\nWhy muted mics won\u2019t help Trump or Harris at debate\n\nPresidential debates matter in American politics. And the one that takes place on Tuesday night between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris \u2013 their only currently scheduled face-off \u2013 may matter more than most. Joe Biden\u2019s poor performance in the first presidential debate in late June created a firestorm of pressure within the Democratic Party that ultimately forced him to abandon his re-election campaign. Even though Kamala Harris has been vice-president for more than three years and a candidate for president for seven weeks, she is still a relative unknown for many Americans. In a recent New York Times survey, 28% of likely November voters said that they needed to know more about the Californian. That poll showed the race a statistical dead heat \u2013 a finding most recent surveys have also indicated, both nationally and in key battleground states. The 2024 presidential campaign has been full of historic tumult, but the American electorate is still sharply \u2013 and narrowly - divided. That underscores the importance of Tuesday night\u2019s debate, where even small shifts in the mood of the electorate could be the difference between victory and defeat for the candidates.\n\nFor Harris, the showdown in Philadelphia provides an opportunity for her to flesh out the details before an audience of tens of millions \u2013 although she will have to do so while under rhetorical fire from her Republican opponent. This opportunity is not without risks, however, as Harris could define herself \u2013 and her positions \u2013 in ways that damage her electoral prospects. She has struggled in the past with answering pointed questions under pressure, and her reluctance to sit for media interviews in the opening weeks of her campaign has denied her the opportunity to hone her linguistic chops. Although she has tried to present herself as the change candidate in this election, the moderators \u2013 and the former president \u2013 are likely to press her to defend the Biden administration\u2019s record, particularly on areas where polls show Democrats are weak, such as border security and inflation. She will also have to explain why she has renounced some of the more liberal policies she embraced during her unsuccessful bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. She recently has walked back her positions on a fracking ban, decriminalising border crossing and nationalising health insurance, among others. She has explained these changes as ones made to reflect new circumstances \u2013 but they may be viewed by some voters as moves born of political expediency.\n\nWhat voters would ask Trump and Harris at the debate\n\nFor Trump, the debate presents an opportunity to wrest back the initiative in this campaign after a month where the Democrats \u2013 with their new nominee and high-energy convention \u2013 dominated political headlines. He has a history of thriving in the spotlight and setting the terms of political conversation that keeps his opponents off-balance and his issues \u2013 notably on immigration and trade, where his positions have broad popular support \u2013 at the forefront of political discussion. The former president has his own potential pitfalls on Tuesday, however. His uneven performance during his June debate with Biden drew little scrutiny because of his opponent\u2019s sometimes catastrophic verbal miscues. Harris is sure to present a more nimble opponent, and his answers will have to be sharper. During a New York economic forum last week, he was unable to offer a clear explanation for his childcare policies. Such verbal meandering during the debate will provide Democrats with a wealth of campaign fodder. Trump must also tread carefully when sparring with the vice-president \u2013 only the second woman presidential nominee and the first of colour. If he comes across as domineering or belittling, he could further damage his already weak support among female voters.\n\nThe two candidates have used markedly different ways of preparing for Tuesday night\u2019s event. The vice-president \u2013 and former prosecutor - has been in Pittsburgh, a few hours' drive west of Philadelphia, holding mock debates and reviewing her policy proposals. The move also allowed her to campaign and benefit from some local media coverage in the largest and most crucial battleground state of Pennsylvania. Trump - who has participated in presidential debates in each of the past three elections - has held more informal sessions, including reviewing his positions on key issues. Last week, he participated in a town hall forum hosted by conservative cable network Fox News. Tuesday, then, is set to be a contrast of styles as well as political views. Although election day won\u2019t arrive until November, early voting is set to begin this month in some key battleground states \u2013 including in pivotal Pennsylvania. So while this debate could help set the political environment for the last two months of the 2024 presidential race, it also will be the last chance for the two candidates to reach some voters in states where every ballot matters.",

Both are challenging in their own way and neither is ever boring.\u201d\n\nHooper\u2019s law practice focuses on product liability, premises liability, transportation litigation and medical device litigation.

This year\u2019s findings show that adults find it hard to tell if information is true or not. They also rely on data and transparency to verify it.\n\nDo Americans trust information they get about the government?\n\nAlthough social media is among respondents\u2019 most-used sources for getting information from the government (40% report using social media to get government data), Americans also cite low levels of trust in information on social platforms.\n\nThey\u2019re also less likely to trust businesses, and artificial intelligence (AI) for accurate data.

The latest average of national polls, meanwhile, shows Harris is 2.8 points ahead of Trump.\n\nMeanwhile, former Republican governor Chris Christie offered some advice to Harris ahead of the highly-anticipated debate.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe advised Harris to draw on \u201ctouchstones\u201d of preparedness and use Trump\u2019s lack of preparation to her advantage. He also said that she would need to \u201ccharm\u201d the American people.\n\n\u201cShe needs to show that she\u2019s not gonna be the 24-hour leaf blower noise that he is,\u201d Christie told ABC News Sunday.\n\n\u201cThere is a way that you can be kind, that you can be smart, and tough at the same time \u2013 that\u2019s the charm,\u201d he continued. \u201cDisarm is...do not engage him in that stuff.\u201d\n\nThis advice comes after Christie helped Trump prep for debates in both 2016 and 2020 before their relationship broke down.\n\nKey Points\n\nWhere do Harris and Trump stand in the polls ahead of tomorrow\u2019s debate?\n\nChris Christie offers key pieces of advice to Harris before Tuesday face-off\n\nAll the rules for the Harris-Trump showdown debate\n\nMeet the man who pretends to be Trump for Kamala Harris\u2019s debate prep\n\nHarris turns to her favorite foods in effort to show a more private side and connect with voters\n\nSunday 8 September 2024 18:30 , AP\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nOne of the biggest challenges for Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris in the final stretch of the campaign is introducing herself to voters before her Republican rival, Donald Trump, has a chance to define her.\n\nUntil her sudden election to the top of the Democratic ticket this summer, Harris was still a somewhat unknown figure in national politics, driven in part by her aversion to opening up and embracing the spotlight. And since she\u2019s become the nominee, Republicans have criticized Harris for not doing many interviews or giving enough specifics on her policy plans.\n\nBut the vice president is sharing personal details about her childhood, cooking and food to show her more private side.\n\nHarris turns to her favorite foods in effort to connect with voters\n\nCheney explains why she backs Harris\n\nSunday 8 September 2024 18:44 , Gustaf Kilander\n\nThe Gossip Girl-like dynamics of the Supreme Court\n\nSunday 8 September 2024 19:00 , Ariana Baio\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThere is perhaps no branch of government that fosters secrecy or harbors sneaky resentment to a degree even Gossip Girl herself would be astonished with, than the Supreme Court.\n\nThe highest court in the land has purposefully cast an opaque fog over its internal workings for decades, but in this past term, it was clear from their opinions that there was drama behind the scenes.\n\nAt the center of that is Justice Amy Coney Barrett.\n\nIf the court itself is Gossip Girl then Barrett is season two Jenny Humphrey. That\u2019s to say, she\u2019s breaking ranks with her OG squad and finding her own voice \u2013 although with less goth eyeliner.\n\nThe Gossip Girl-like dynamics of the Supreme Court\n\nVIDEO: Harris campaign unveils \u2018New Way Forward\u2019 ad ahead of debate with Trump\n\nSunday 8 September 2024 19:30 , Reann Philogene\n\nHarris and Trump \u2018neck and neck\u2019 heading into crucial debate, says new poll\n\nSunday 8 September 2024 20:00 , Graeme Massie\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nKamala Harris and Donald Trump are running neck and neck ahead of this week\u2019s high-stakes presidential debate, according to a new poll.\n\nThe vice president and her Republican rival are separated by just one point days before they take the debate stage in Pittsburgh, the poll by The New York Times/Siena College found.\n\nThe poll was taken between September 3 and September 6 and found 47 percent of likely voters backing Harris. Meanwhile, 48 percent of likely voters backed Trump in the poll.\n\nTuesday night\u2019s ABC News debate will be the first for Harris but the second for Trump after he took on Joe Biden in June.\n\nHarris and Trump \u2018neck and neck\u2019 heading into crucial debate, says new poll\n\n\u2018The Republicans have nominated someone who is depraved,' Cheney says\n\nSunday 8 September 2024 20:30 , Gustaf Kilander\n\nHarris campaign touts Republican support\n\nSunday 8 September 2024 21:00 , Gustaf Kilander\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe Harris campaign noted in a press release on Sunday the amount of support from Republicans the vice president has received, such as from former Vice President Dick Cheney, his daughter, former Congresswoman Liz Cheney, her former January 6 Select Committee colleague Adam Kinzinger, former Georgia Lieutenant Governor Geoff Duncan, former Trump White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham, and former Mike Pence advisor Olivia Troye.\n\nThey added that Harris has the support of more than 230 alumni of George W Bush, John McCain, and Mitt Romney.\n\n\u201cAs hundreds of Republican leaders have already realized, Vice President Harris is offering a New Way Forward for all Americans who reject Donald Trump\u2019s threats to our freedom and his dangerous Project 2025 agenda,\u201d the campaign said. \u201cBetween now and Election Day, Team Harris-Walz will continue making the case to conservative, independent, and moderate voters that they have the choice to put their country and democracy first and leave Donald Trump\u2019s toxic chaos and division behind.\u201d\n\nNC gov says if Harris wins his state, she wins the White House\n\nSunday 8 September 2024 21:30 , Gustaf Kilander\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nNorth Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, who was in the race to be Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019s running mate before asking that he not be considered, told CBS\u2019s Face the Nation that if Harris wins his state, she\u2019ll win the White House.\n\nThe last time a Democrat won the Tar Heel state was in 2008, when Barack Obama won it for the Democrats for the first time since Jimmy Carter ran in 1976.\n\nCooper told CBS that if Harris wins North Carolina, \u201cshe is the next president of the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s close here in North Carolina. It always is,\u201d he added. \u201cThis was Biden-Harris\u2019s closest loss in 2020, only 1.3%. So the fact that Kamala Harris, as Vice President of the United States, has been to North Carolina 17 times shows that she cares about our state.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s got a plan to lower costs for North Carolinians, particularly in this childcare arena, drug pricing. We\u2019re excited about the economic plan that she has \u2026 and I think North Carolinians will respond to it,\u201d the governor said.\n\n\u201cWhen we continue to get this information out to the American public, and to people here in North Carolina, that Kamala Harris has an economic plan that\u2019s going to help lower the cost for everyday people, that\u2019s going to help families thrive, that is going to protect women\u2019s reproductive freedom. I think at the end of the day, that\u2019s going to be what works here,\u201d he added.\n\nLiz Cheney torches Nikki Haley over support for Donald Trump\n\nSunday 8 September 2024 22:00 , John Bowden\n\nLiz Cheney is ready to force a reckoning for those Republicans who have come around to support Donald Trump for what she says are purely political reasons.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAnti-Trump Republicans including Cheney have become increasingly vocal in the past few months as Kamala Harris has ascended to the top of the Democratic ticket; emboldened by the new vigor her party has found in her wake. Trump, now running for the presidency for a third time, is poised to either pull off a massive political comeback or suffer his second defeat in as many presidential election cycles \u2014 to say nothing of the defeats his hand-picked candidates suffered in 2022\u2019s midterms.\n\nHis enemies on the right, despite his dominating victory in the Republican primary earlier this year, still smell blood in the water and are now looking to Harris to deal an electoral deathblow this November.\n\nLiz Cheney torches Nikki Haley over support for Donald Trump\n\nWarnock responds to JD Vance\u2019s comments on Georgia shooting: Guns make us all \u2018sitting ducks\u2019\n\nSunday 8 September 2024 22:30 , John Bowden\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nOne of Georgia\u2019s senators has responded to Republican vice presidential contender JD Vance after he referred to school shootings as a regrettable \u201cfact of life\u201d in modern society.\n\nRaphael Warnock, who won a six-year term in 2022 after defeating a Republican challenger to secure his first full term in office, appeared on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on Sunday after a shooting in his state claimed the lives of two students and two teachers at a high school. Nine others were injured.\n\nHe was asked about the comments by Vance, which ignited a media firestorm and were seized upon by Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign as the latest sign of Republicans\u2019 refusal to address such horrific attacks in American schools. The Ohio senator, speaking at a rally in Arizona, lamented, \u201cI don\u2019t like that this is a fact of life\u201d after the shooting took place last week.\n\nWarnock responds to JD Vance\u2019s shooting comments: Guns make us all \u2018sitting ducks\u2019\n\nHarris says she\u2019s \u2018ready\u2019 for debate\n\nSunday 8 September 2024 22:32 , Andrew Feinberg\n\nThe vice president, wearing all black, a hat, and a scarf, and the Second Gentleman, wearing a Harris/Walz sweatshirt, walked past reporters as part of what took on the feel of an impromptu procession, preceded by and followed by aides and security personnel both on foot and in vehicles.\n\nAt first, she did not answer questions about how she would respond to Trump at their upcoming debate and said \u201cthank you\u201d in the reporters\u2019 direction.\n\nThe Independent asked if she is ready for the debate. The vice president turned, made a thumbs-up gesture up and replied: \u201cReady!\u201d\n\nNew Mexico governor to campaign for Harris in Virginia ahead of debate\n\nSunday 8 September 2024 23:00 , Gustaf Kilander\n\nNew Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham will campaign for the Harris-Walz team in Northern Virginia on Monday ahead of Tuesday\u2019s debate.\n\nThere she will hold \u201cfireside chats\u201d to \u201chighlight the stark contrast between Vice President Harris\u2019 vision for a New Way Forward and Trump\u2019s Project 2025 agenda,\u201d the Harris campaign said in an advisory.\n\nLujan Grisham will take part in a Women for Harris event to speak about abortion rights and a Latinos con Harris-Walz event where she\u2019ll \u201chighlight how Trump\u2019s Project 2025 would make life harder and more expensive for Latino families in Virginia and across the country,\u201d the campaign added.\n\nKimberly Guilfoyle forced to ask audience to clap as awkward speech falls flat\n\nSunday 8 September 2024 23:30 , Gustaf Kilander\n\nKimberly Guilfoyle eventually had to ask her audience at the Florida Republican Party annual dinner to clap for her as her awkward speech fell flat in front of an audience of allies.\n\nIt was a moment reminiscent of Jeb Bush\u2019s \u201cplease clap\u201d moment during the 2016 campaign.\n\nGuilfoyle, the fianc\u00e9 of Donald Trump Jr, was speaking at the dinner in Hollywood, Florida when she shared her hope that Democrats would lose seats in Congress and be forced to give up control of the White House.\n\nKimberly Guilfoyle forced to ask audience to clap as awkward speech falls flat\n\nHarris and Walz set for \u2018New Way Forward\u2019 swing state tour after ABC debate\n\nMonday 9 September 2024 00:00 , Andrew Feinberg\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz will follow up on Harris\u2019s Tuesday face-off against Donald Trump by embarking on a whirlwind tour of swing states in hopes of seizing momentum off her debate performance this week.\n\nThe Harris-Walz campaign says the vice president and her running-mate will criss-cross the country following Tuesday night\u2019s debate to make appearances in each individual media market in every single swing state over a four-day period next week.\n\nThe candidates\u2019 spouses, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff and Minnesota First Lady Gwen Walz, will also make a series of appearances in support of the campaign in the coming days.\n\nHarris and Walz set for \u2018New Way Forward\u2019 swing state tour after ABC debate\n\nCheney explains her decision to back Harris: \u2018The right vote to make this time around\u2019\n\nMonday 9 September 2024 01:00 , Gustaf Kilander\n\nLiz Cheney, the former Republican congresswoman, appeared on ABC\u2019s This Week on Sunday to speak about her decision to back Kamala Harris, warning of an \u201cunrecoverable catastrophe\u201d if former President Donald Trump returns to the White House.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been voting for 40 years. My first vote I ever cast was for Ronald Reagan in 1984. I\u2019ve never voted for a Democrat and it tells you, I think, the stakes in this election,\u201d she said.\n\nShe urged voters to listen to Harris \u201ctalk about her vision for this country, her vision for the future \u2026 If you\u2019re talking about a national security set of issues, and you care about America\u2019s leadership role in the world, a vote for Vice President Harris is the right vote to make this time around.\u201d\n\nWalz touts abiding support for LGBTQ+ rights: \u2018Why would I stop anybody else from marrying the person they love?\u2019\n\nMonday 9 September 2024 02:00 , Eric Garcia\n\nOn Saturday Minnesota Governor Tim Walz took a break from campaigning in swing states to address the largest pro-LGBTQ+ rights group in the country about his first run for Congress in 2006 in a Republican district when he was asked about whether he supported civil unions for gay couples.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018sure, if that\u2019s your thing,\u2019\u201d Walz told attendees at the Human Rights Campaign\u2019s annual dinner on Saturday evening. \u201cBut I said, my marriage, my wife, Gwen is the most important thing in my life. I love her deeply. Why would I stop anybody else from marrying the person they love? That makes no sense.\u201d\n\nAt the time, many Democrats had run away from supporting same-sex marriage and had a tenuous relationship with gay rights at best. Two years before, George W Bush had won re-election by supporting a constitutional amendment defining marriage as between a man and a woman. Shortly after, Walz won his race in 2006 and people praised him for winning despite supporting abortion rights and same-sex marriage.\n\nWalz touts his record supporting LGBTQ+ rights in difficult times\n\nJohn Fetterman says Joe Biden would have beaten Donald Trump again\n\nMonday 9 September 2024 03:00 , John Bowden\n\nJohn Fetterman, one of Joe Biden\u2019s loudest defenders during calls from within his own party to step down, still believes that the incumbent president could have beaten Donald Trump a second time.\n\nThe freshman senator from Pennsylvania elected in 2022, was one of the many Democrats who refused to call for Biden to step aside in the wake of a whispery, wandering performance at a June debate with Trump in Atlanta.\n\nBut Fetterman, who suffered a stroke and battled his own issues with speech impairments in the final days of his winning 2022 campaign, took things a step further as he suggested that Biden\u2019s critics in the Democratic Party were helping Trump win \u2014 a charge that seemed at odds with polling that showed Biden behind the former president long before the outpouring of Democratic whinging began.\n\nJohn Fetterman says Joe Biden would have beaten Donald Trump again\n\nTrump falsely claims children being forced into gender transition ops at school in rambling fantasy-filled rally speech\n\nMonday 9 September 2024 04:00 , Gustaf Kilander\n\nDonald Trump falsely claimed yet again that children are the subject of \u201cbrutal\u201d gender operations at schools across the US.\n\n\u201cKamala supports states being able to take minor children and perform sex change operations, take them away from their parents, perform sex change operations, and send them back home,\u201d Trump said in Mosinee, Wisconsin on Saturday afternoon.\n\n\u201cCan you imagine you\u2019re a parent and your son leaves the house and you say, \u2018Jimmy, I love you so much. Go have a good day in school\u2019 and your son comes back with a brutal operation,\u201d he added. \u201cCan you even imagine this?

Nine others were injured.\n\nHe was asked about the comments by Vance, which ignited a media firestorm and were seized upon by Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign as the latest sign of Republicans\u2019 refusal to address such horrific attacks in American schools.

President who is not smart enough to answer reporters [sic] questions,\u201d he wrote on his Truth Social platform.\n\nTrump has also been busy promoting a spurious warning from Tucker Carlson about voter fraud in Pennsylvania, seemingly preparing the ground for contesting his ultimate defeat in November\u2019s election.\n\n\u201cThe 2024 Election, where Votes have just started being cast, will be under the closest professional scrutiny and, WHEN I WIN, those people that CHEATED will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law, which will include long term prison sentences so that this

vice president and warned that the mass deporation of illegal immigrants on his watch would be \u201ca bloody story\u201d, a particularly disturbing turn of phrase to throw around so casually.\n\nEven more absurdly, he suggested that children in American schools are being forced to undergo \u201cbrutal\u201d gender transition surgery against their will, an utterly hysterical claim for which his own

        "text": "Who won the debate? Harris goads Trump into flustered performance\nWho won the Harris-Trump presidential debate?\n\nWatch highlights from Harris-Trump clash\n\nDonald Trump and Kamala Harris met for the first time on the presidential debate stage in Philadelphia on Tuesday night. They may have shaken hands, but they did not hit it off. In a fiery 90 minutes, Harris frequently rattled the former president with personal attacks that threw him off message and raised the temperature of this highly-anticipated contest. Her pointed digs on the size of his rally crowds, his conduct during the Capitol riot, and on the officials who served in his administration who have since become outspoken critics of his campaign repeatedly left Trump on the back foot. The pattern for much of this debate was Harris goading her Republican rival into making extended defences of his past conduct and comments. He gladly obliged, raising his voice at times and shaking his head. Americans should go to a Trump rally, Harris said during an early question about immigration, because they were illuminating. \u201cPeople start leaving the rallies early out of exhaustion and boredom,\u201d she said. That barb clearly rattled the former president, as he then spent most of his answer \u2013 on a topic that should have been one of his main areas of strength \u2013 defending his rally sizes and belittling hers. Trump went from there to an extended riff on a debunked report that Haitian immigrants in the town of Springfield, Ohio, were abducting and eating their neighbours\u2019 pets.\n\nIf debates are won and lost on which candidate best takes advantage of issues where they are strong - and defends or deflects on areas of weakness - Tuesday night tilted in favour of the vice-president. A snap CNN poll of voters watching said that Harris performed better and betting markets said the same. This is a snapshot that could be momentary but the Harris tactic of putting Trump on the defensive was clear early in the evening when the topics covered were the economy and abortion. Public opinion surveys indicate many Americans are unhappy with how the Biden administration \u2013 of which Harris is a key member \u2013 has handled inflation and the economy.\n\nUS election debate latest\n\nBut Harris turned the topic to Trump\u2019s proposed across-the-board tariffs, which she labelled a \u201cTrump sales tax\u201d, and then brought up Project 2025, the controversial independent conservative plan for a future Republican administration. As he has in the past, Trump distanced himself from the project and defended his tariff plan, noting that the Biden administration had kept many of the tariffs in his first presidency. They were valid points, but it kept him from hammering the vice-president on inflation and consumer prices.\n\nHarris and Trump's first debate explained in 60 seconds\n\nOn abortion, Trump defended his handling of the issue, saying that Americans across the spectrum wanted Roe v Wade abortion protections overturned by the Supreme Court \u2013 a statement that polling does not support. He struggled to make his position clear and his answer was at times rambling. Harris, meanwhile, took the opportunity to make an impassioned, personal appeal to families who have faced severe pregnancy complications and have been unable to receive abortion care in states that have banned the procedure \u2013 states with \u201cTrump abortion bans\u201d, as she called them. \u201cIt\u2019s insulting to the women of America,\u201d she concluded. It was a carefully modulated message in an area in which she has a double-digit advantage over Trump.\n\nTime and time again as the evening progressed, Harris put Trump on the defensive with jabs and barbs that he could have ignored but seemingly felt compelled to address. At one point, Harris was asked about the liberal positions, such as those on oil shale fracking, that she took during her failed 2019 presidential campaign and has since abandoned. Her deliberate prodding continued and she ended her answer by noting that she did not take handouts from her wealthy father. Again, the former president took the bait. Instead of hitting the vice-president on her shifting views \u2013 a clear area of weakness \u2013 he opened his response by talking about the \u201ctiny fraction\u201d of money he took from his father. On the Afghanistan withdrawal, another weak point for Harris, the vice-president shifted the conversation to Trump\u2019s negotiations with Taliban officials and inviting them to Camp David. It was a pattern that played out over and over and proved very effective.\n\nWatch: Trump in the spin room on eating pets, and Taylor Swift\n\nRepublicans are already complaining about what they say was the favouritism the ABC moderators, David Muir and Linsey Davis, showed toward Harris. Both of them pushed back and fact-checked assertions made by Trump on several occasions. In the end, however, it was Trump\u2019s responses and eagerness to take and devour whatever bait Harris set out for him that was the story of the evening. And that played out in the faces of the two candidates. Whenever her opponent was talking, Harris took on a studied look of bemusement or incredulity. Trump, for his part, mostly scowled. Up until now, the Harris campaign had been coy about whether she would agree to another debate. Almost immediately after this one ended, they called for a second presidential debate before November. That alone should indicate how well the Democrats think Tuesday night went for Harris.\n\nMore on the US election",

        "text": "When will the next presidential debate of 2024 take place and who will moderate it?\nBefore President Biden decided to drop out of the race for reelection, he and former President Donald Trump had agreed to one more showdown on the debate stage before the 2024 presidential election.\n\nAfter Mr. Biden ended his campaign, it was initially unclear whether a debate between Trump and the new Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, would take place, but both campaigns have confirmed they will participate in the debate scheduled for Tuesday, Sept. 10 \u2014 just a few weeks after Harris formally accepted the nomination. It will be the first time she and Trump meet in person.\n\nWhen is the second presidential debate?\n\nABC News is hosting the second presidential debate on Tuesday, Sept. 10, at 9 p.m. Eastern Time. The debate will be simulcast on other networks, including CBS, and can be streamed live. (Find full details on how to watch here.)\n\nThe debate will be held at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia.\n\nThe first presidential debate, on June 27, in which Trump faced President Biden in Atlanta, came unusually early in the election season given that neither candidate had formally received their party's nomination yet. Trump accepted the GOP nomination on July 18 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Mr. Biden withdrew from the race on July 21 and Harris accepted the Democratic nomination during the party's convention in Chicago on Aug. 22.\n\nPlans for the ABC debate had been in question after Trump said on Aug. 3 that he was \"terminating\" it and would do a debate hosted by Fox News on Sept. 4 instead. Harris responded that she would be at the ABC News debate on Sept. 10 and hoped \"to see him there.\"\n\nThen, at a news conference at his Mar-a-Lago estate on Thursday, Aug. 8, Trump recommitted to the ABC News debate.\n\nHe also proposed two others, with Fox News on Sept. 4 and NBC News on Sept. 25. A Harris campaign spokesperson said Harris is \"open to and eager to discuss more debates, but Trump has to show up to the September 10th debate first.\" The Harris campaign said it would be willing to debate at an unspecified date in October.\n\nFighting over muted mics\n\nThe Harris campaign agreed on Sept. 4, six days before the debate, to allow microphones to be muted when a candidate isn't speaking, ending a protracted fight that was the final sticking point in negotiations on the rules of the debate.\n\nIn a letter to ABC News, the campaign wrote that Harris would be \"fundamentally disadvantaged by this format, which will serve to shield Donald Trump from direct exchanges with the Vice President.\"\n\n\"Notwithstanding our concerns, we understand that Donald Trump is a risk to skip the debate altogether, as he has threatened to do previously, if we do not accede to his preferred format,\" the Harris campaign continued. \"We do not want to jeopardize the debate.\"\n\nTrump campaign spokesperson Jason Miller said in a statement, \"We are thrilled that Kamala Harris and her team of Biden campaign leftovers...have finally accepted the already agreed upon rules of the debate that they wrote in the first place.\"\n\nEarlier, on Aug. 26, Trump seemed to indicate that he would not participate in the ABC News debate, saying that his campaign had agreed to the same rules regarding microphones that were in place for the first presidential debate, which included muting the mics.\n\nHarris' team confirmed it did not want to mute the mics while the other candidate was talking and said, \"[O]ur understanding is that Trump's handlers prefer the muted microphone because they don't think their candidate can act presidential for 90 minutes on his own.\"\n\nTrump said later that day, \"We agreed to the same rules. I don't know, doesn't matter to me.\"\n\nWho will moderate the next debate?\n\n\"World News Tonight\" anchor David Muir and ABC News Live \"Prime\" anchor Linsey Davis will moderate the debate, ABC News said.\n\nWhich candidates qualify for the debate?\n\nOnly Trump and Harris will take part in the debate. The qualifications are similar to the first debate, and no non-major party candidates met he ballot access and polling requirements to earn a spot on stage. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who was running as an independent, suspended his campaign on Aug. 23 and threw his support behind Trump.\n\nCandidates need to earn at least 15% support in four approved national polls and be on the ballot in enough states to be able to win 270 votes in the Electoral College \u2014 the threshold to win the presidency \u2014 in order to qualify.\n\nHow many more debates will there be for 2024?\n\nThere are no other presidential debates scheduled before the election at this point. The campaigns previously agreed to only two debates \u2014 the one hosted by CNN on June 27 and the other by ABC News on Sept. 10. Trump has proposed two more, but the Harris campaign has not agreed, instead saying it would evaluate a second debate in October after the first meeting.\n\nCBS News has also invited the campaigns to participate in a vice presidential debate on Oct. 1, and both the Democrat, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, and the Republican, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, have accepted.\n\nThe candidates have bypassed the tradition of three debates organized by the nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates, which had overseen presidential debates since 1988. The commission's three debates were scheduled to take place in September and October at universities in Texas, Virginia and Utah. Instead, this year's debates were agreed upon without any involvement by the commission.\n\nThe commission was met with sharp criticism by both Trump \u2014 who has accused the commission of being biased against Republicans \u2014 and by close advisers to Mr. Biden, who view commission procedures as outmoded and fussy. The co-chair of the commission, Frank Fahrenkopf, told CBS News' podcast \"The Takeout\" that top White House communications adviser Anita Dunn \"doesn't like us,\" and he said on a Politico podcast that this was the reason Mr. Biden's team went around the commission to negotiate directly with Trump's campaign.\n\ncontributed to this report.",

        "text": "Harris on offence against Trump during U.S. presidential debate\nDemocratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump sparred over abortion, the state of U.S. democracy and the 2020 election during the ABC News Presidential Debate on Tuesday in Philadelphia. Here are some of the major moments \u2014 including one where moderator David Muir fact-checked one of Trump\u2019s assertions.\n\nWalking onto the debate stage on Tuesday night, Vice-President Kamala Harris strode over to former president Donald Trump and reached out for a handshake. It was the first time the two presidential candidates had met face to face \u2014 at a debate or otherwise.\n\nHarris, 59, spent the next 90-odd minutes firmly on the offensive, goading Trump with jabs about his felony conviction, the size of crowds at his rallies and his reputation among world leaders.\n\nA rattled Trump, 78, often took the bait and spent more time defending his own record than challenging his opponent. His defence included a litany of falsehoods, personal attacks and debunked misinformation \u2014 likely exactly as his opponent had hoped.\n\n\"Harris dominated,\" said Georgia Kernell, an associate political science professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who specializes in political communication.\n\n\"I think, actually, Trump hurt himself as much as she helped herself.\"\n\nTrump and Harris are seen during the debate on Tuesday. (Brian Snyder/Reuters)\n\nThe stakes were high for both candidates, but the debate was Harris's best opportunity to define her candidacy and appeal to undecided voters in what polls show to be a tight race for the White House. (Her performance earned a boost from one voter in singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, who endorsed Harris to her 283 million Instagram followers almost immediately after the debate ended on ABC.)\n\nFor Trump, it was his best chance to try to chip away at Harris's campaign momentum. He repeatedly tried to paint her as a candidate who would only bring a repeat of the Biden presidency and worked to bring the conversation back to immigration, arguably one of the strongest issues with his voter base, though Harris's criticism often derailed his answers.\n\nIn a sign of confidence in Harris's performance, her campaign challenged Trump to another round in October.\n\nTrump then took the rare step of going into the nearby \"spin room\" after the debate, a task usually left to political supporters, where he said the event had been his \"best debate.\" He later told Fox News that Harris only asked for another debate \"because she lost.\"\n\nRepublican presidential nominee and former U.S. President Donald Trump reacts in the spin room after his debate with Democratic presidential nominee and U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday. (Evelyn Hockstein/Reuters)\n\nThroughout the event in Philadelphia, the Democratic and Republican nominees disagreed over the economy, immigration, abortion, race, foreign policy, climate change and other key issues. Each went after the other's character more as the debate progressed, staying light on policy specifics.\n\nHarris criticized Trump's political rallies, saying attendees leave early due to \"exhaustion and boredom,\" after which he brought up a debunked online conspiracy theory about Haitian immigrants eating pets in Springfield, Ohio.\n\n\"In Springfield, they're eating the dogs. The people that came in, they're eating the cats. They're eating... they're eating the pets of the people that live there,\" said Trump.\n\nWATCH | Moderator corrects Trump on 'eating the pets' comment: Moderator fact-checks Trump\u2019s claim that illegal immigrants are \u2018eating the pets\u2019 Duration 0:54 After Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump claimed that illegal immigrants were eating dogs and cats in Springfield, Ohio, ABC News Presidential Debate moderator David Muir said the city manager told ABC News \u2018there have been no credible reports\u2019 of such incidents.\n\nLater asked why he had questioned Harris's racial identity in the past, Trump said, \"I don't care what she is\" and said he had read his opponent was not actually Black. Harris said it was a \"tragedy\" to see Trump use race to divide the nation.\n\nIn another exchange, Trump suggested the Democrats' rhetoric was to blame for the attempt on his life at a rally in Butler, Pa., on July 13.\n\n\"I probably took a bullet to the head for the things they say about me,\" Trump said.\n\nWATCH | Harris speaks on abortion rights: \u2018Bleeding out in a car\u2019 due to abortion restrictions is not what America wants, Harris says Duration 0:53 \u2018The government, and Donald Trump certainly, should not be telling a woman what to do with her body,\u2019 Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris said during the ABC News Presidential Debate on Tuesday in Philadelphia.\n\nThe candidates' first exchange of the night focused on the economy and the cost of living, one of the biggest issues of the campaign and another one of Trump's strongest. Harris spoke about her middle-class upbringing in California and said she wanted to create an \"opportunity economy,\" while saying Trump would cut taxes for the richest Americans.\n\nIn his response, Trump defended his trade policy, noting the Biden administration left his tariffs in place. He criticized Harris over inflation, said his new tariffs on foreign goods would be \"substantial\" and insisted plans to cut taxes would jump-start the economy.\n\nWATCH | Trump links Democrats' rhetoric to attempt on his life: \u2018Trump was fired by 81 million people,\u2019 Harris says of 2020 election Duration 0:23 During the ABC News Presidential Debate, Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris says the U.S. cannot afford a president who would \u2018upend the will of the voters in a free and fair election\u2019 in reference to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump\u2019s refusal to admit his loss in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nAnother question was about reproductive rights and the reversal of Roe v. Wade, the landmark decision that established Americans' right to an abortion. Harris was forceful in her response, saying \"the government and Donald Trump certainly should not be telling a woman what to do with her body.\" Harris also claimed Trump would support a national ban.\n\nTrump said that claim was untrue, but would not answer a yes-or-no question about such a law.\n\nTrump said he did the nation \"a great service\" by appointing the three Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn Roe v. Wade in 2022.\n\nNo clear plan on Middle East\n\nThe candidates were also asked about the Israel-Hamas war and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nHarris did not offer a clear plan to end the war in the Middle East, saying only that she would \"work around the clock\" to end the conflict. She instead reiterated her support for Israel, expressed horror at the death toll in Gaza and attacked Trump by saying military leaders believed him to be a disgrace.\n\nTrump did not say how he would end the war, either, but said the conflict never would have started had he been in office. He said the same for the Russia-Ukraine file, calling Harris \"weak.\"\n\nHarris responded by telling Trump that Russian President Vladimir Putin would \"eat [him] for lunch.\"\n\n\"If Donald Trump were president, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now,\" she said.\n\nABC News anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis, who moderated the debate, periodically corrected falsehoods from Trump \u2014 including his remark about the pets in Ohio and another false claim that some states allow a baby to be killed after birth.\n\nTrump repeated his false claims that his election loss in 2020 was fraudulent.\n\nDebate especially critical for Harris\n\nThe potential ramifications of a poor debate showing were made clear after Biden's halting performance during the previous debate on June 27, which led to his dropping from the race weeks later to make way for Harris. That however overshadowed Trump's debate performance, during which he offered a litany of untruths and refused to condemn the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nKernell, the political scientist, said a strong debate doesn't usually win a campaign the same way a poor performance can end one \u2014 but this event was unusually critical for Harris.\n\nDemocratic presidential nominee and U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris visits a watch party in Philadelphia after debating U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday. (Elizabeth Frantz/Reuters)\n\nIn her first presidential debate and the longest unscripted event of her campaign to date, the Democratic nominee faced a TV audience not only listening for her policies but watching how she handled a bombastic opponent who often speaks with little regard for facts.\n\n\"We hadn't seen these two meet. We hadn't seen her ever debate as a presidential candidate. She's been the candidate for such a short amount of time... it was really important for her to show that she is presidential, that she has a clear plan and that she can lead this country,\" said Kernell.\n\n\"I think in that sense, she probably will get a boost.\"\n\nWATCH | Harris says Trump would 'upend the will of the voters': Harris, Trump exchange barbs over who would be worse for U.S. democracy Duration 0:47 Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris warned viewers of a second Donald Trump presidency \u2018with no guardrails\u2019 during the ABC News Presidential Debate. In response, the Republican presidential candidate said he \u2018probably took a bullet to the head because of the things they say about me.\u2019\n\nBy contrast, Trump has been on the presidential debate stage seven times and already has a loyal base whose feelings haven't been swayed by two impeachments, several indictments and a felony conviction.\n\nThe two nominees are effectively tied in the seven battleground states likely to decide the election, according to polling averages compiled by the New York Times.\n\nThere are 56 days until U.S. voters head to the polls on Nov. 5. A vice-presidential debate is scheduled for Oct. 1.",

        "text": "Elections 2024: Where Kamala Harris, Donald Trump stand on key issues\nThis year\u2019s presidential race is a genuine contest of ideas between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump \u2014 with clear differences on taxes, abortion, immigration, global alliances, climate change and democracy itself.\n\nSince replacing President Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee, Harris has pledged to chart a new way forward even as she has embraced many of his ideas. She wants middle class tax cuts, tax hikes on the wealthy and corporations, a restoration of abortion rights and a government that aggressively addresses climate change, among other stances.\n\nSeeking a return to the White House, Trump wants to accomplish much of what he couldn\u2019t do during a term that was sidetracked by the global pandemic. The Republican wants the extension and expansion of his 2017 tax cuts, a massive increase in tariffs, more support for fossil fuels and a greater concentration of government power in the White House.\n\nThe two candidates have spelled out their ideas in speeches, advertisements and other venues. Many of their proposals lack specifics, making it difficult to judge exactly how they would translate their intentions into law or pay for them. While the candidates agree on not taxing workers\u2019 tips, the outcome in November could drastically change the tax code, America\u2019s support for Ukraine, abortion access and the commitments made to limit the damage caused by climate change.\n\nHere\u2019s where each candidate stands on 10 top issues:\n\nAbortion\n\nHARRIS\n\nThe vice president has called on Congress to pass legislation guaranteeing in federal law abortion access, a right that stood for nearly 50 years before being overturned by the Supreme Court. Like Biden, Harris has criticized bans on abortion in Republican-controlled states and promised as president to block any potential nationwide ban should one clear a future GOP-run Congress. Harris was the Democrats\u2019 most visible champion of abortion rights even while Biden was still in the race. She has promoted the administration\u2019s efforts short of federal law \u2014 including steps to protect women who travel to access the procedure and limit how law enforcement collects medical records.\n\nTRUMP\n\nThe former president often brags about appointing the Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade. After dodging questions about when in pregnancy he believes the procedure should be restricted, Trump announced last spring that decisions on access and cutoffs should be left to the states. He has said he would not sign a national abortion ban into law if one landed on his desk and recently said he would not try to block access to abortion medication. He told Time magazine that it should also be left up to states to determine whether to prosecute women for abortions or to monitor their pregnancies. He has also said that, if he wins, he wants to make IVF treatment free for women.\n\nClimate/Energy\n\nHARRIS\n\nAs a senator from California, the vice president was an early sponsor of the Green New Deal, a sweeping series of proposals meant to swiftly move the U.S. to fully green energy that is championed by the Democratic Party\u2019s most progressive wing. Harris also said during her short-lived 2020 presidential campaign that she opposed offshore drilling for oil and hydraulic fracturing. But during her three and a half years as vice president, Harris has adopted more moderate positions, focusing instead on implementing the climate provisions of the Biden administration\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act. That provided nearly $375 billion for things like financial incentives for electric cars and clean energy projects. The Biden administration has also enlisted more than 20,000 young people in a national \u201cClimate Corps,\u201d a Peace Corps-like program to promote conservation through tasks such as weatherizing homes and repairing wetlands. Despite that, it\u2019s unlikely that the U.S. will be on track to meet Biden\u2019s goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030 \u2014 a benchmark that Harris hasn\u2019t talked about in the early part of her own White House bid.\n\nTRUMP\n\nHis mantra for one of his top policy priorities: \u201cDRILL, BABY, DRILL.\u201d Trump, who in the past cast climate change as a \u201choax\u201d and harbors a particular disdain for wind power, says it\u2019s his goal for the U.S. to have the cheapest energy and electricity in the world and has claimed he can cut prices in half within a year of his potential return to office. He\u2019d increase oil drilling on public lands, offer tax breaks to oil, gas and coal producers, speed the approval of natural gas pipelines, open dozens of new power plants, including nuclear facilities, and roll back the Biden administration\u2019s aggressive efforts to get people to switch to electric cars, which he argues have a place but shouldn\u2019t be forced on consumers. He has also pledged to re-exit the Paris Climate Accords, end wind subsidies and eliminate regulations imposed and proposed by the Biden administration targeting energy-inefficient kinds of lightbulbs, stoves, dishwashers and shower heads.\n\nDemocracy/Rule of Law\n\nHARRIS\n\nLike Biden, Harris has decried Trump as a threat to the nation\u2019s democracy. But, in attacking her opponent, the vice president has leaned more heavily into her personal background as a prosecutor and contrasted that with Trump being found guilty of 34 felony counts in a New York hush money case and in being found liable for fraudulent business practices and sexual abuse in civil court. The vice president has also talked less frequently than Biden did about Trump\u2019s denial that he lost the 2020 presidential election and his spurring on the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol. When she\u2019s interrupted during rallies with supporters\u2019 \u201cLock him up!\u201d chants directed at Trump, Harris responds that the courts can \u201chandle that\u201d and that \u201cour job is to beat him in November.\u201d\n\nTRUMP\n\nAfter refusing to accept his loss to Biden in 2020, Trump hasn\u2019t committed to accepting the results this time around. He\u2019s repeatedly promised to pardon the Jan. 6 defendants jailed for assaulting police officers and other crimes during the attack on the Capitol, and recently threatened to jail lawyers, election officials, donors and others \u201cinvolved in unscrupulous behavior\u201d surrounding November\u2019s vote, again stoking unfounded fears. He vows to overhaul the Justice Department and FBI \u201cfrom the ground up,\u201d aggrieved by the criminal charges the department has brought against him. He also promises to deploy the National Guard to cities such as Chicago that are struggling with violent crime and in response to protests, and has also vowed to appoint a special prosecutor to go after Biden.\n\nFederal government\n\nHARRIS\n\nLike Biden, Harris has campaigned hard against \u201cProject 2025,\u201d a plan authored by leading conservatives to move as swiftly as possible to dramatically remake the federal government and push it to the right if Trump wins back the White House. She is also part of an administration that is already taking steps to make it harder for any mass firings of civil servants to occur. In April, the Office of Personnel Management issued a new rule that would ban federal workers from being reclassified as political appointees or other at-will employees, thus making them easier to dismiss. That was in response to Schedule F, a 2020 executive order from Trump that reclassified tens of thousands of federal workers to make firing them easier.\n\nTRUMP\n\nThe former president has sought to distance himself from \u201cProject 2025,\u201d despite his close ties to many of its key architects. He has nonetheless vowed his own overhaul of the federal bureaucracy, which he has long blamed for blocking his first term agenda, saying: \u201cI will totally obliterate the deep state.\u201d The former president plans to reissue the Schedule F order stripping civil service protections. He says he\u2019d then move to fire \u201crogue bureaucrats,\u201d including those who \u201dweaponized our justice system,\u201d and the \u201cwarmongers and America-Last globalists in the Deep State, the Pentagon, the State Department, and the national security industrial complex.\u201d Trump has also pledged to terminate the Education Department and wants to curtail the independence of regulatory agencies like the Federal Communications Commission. As part of his effort to cut government waste and red tape, he has also pledged to eliminate at least 10 federal regulations for every new one imposed.\n\nImmigration\n\nHARRIS\n\nAttempting to defuse a GOP line of political attack, the vice president has talked up her experience as California attorney general, saying she walked drug smuggler tunnels and successfully prosecuted gangs that moved narcotics and people across the border. Early in his term, Biden made Harris his administration\u2019s point person on the root causes of migration. Trump and top Republicans now blame Harris for a situation at the U.S.-Mexico border that they say is out of control due to policies that were too lenient. Harris has countered that Trump worsened the situation by killing a bipartisan Senate compromise that would have included tougher asylum standards and hiring more border agents, immigration judges and asylum officers. She said she would bring back that bill and sign that law, saying that Trump \u201ctalks the talk, but doesn\u2019t walk the walk\u201d on immigration. The vice president has endorsed comprehensive immigration reform, seeking pathways to citizenship for immigrants in the U.S. without legal status, with a faster track for young immigrants living in the country illegally who arrived as children.\n\nTRUMP\n\nThe former president promises to mount the largest domestic deportation in U.S. history \u2014 an operation that could involve detention camps and the National Guard. He\u2019d bring back policies he put in place during his first term, like the Remain in Mexico program and Title 42, which placed curbs on migrants on public health grounds. And he\u2019d revive and expand the travel ban that originally targeted citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries. After the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, he pledged new \u201cideological screening\u201d for immigrants to bar \u201cdangerous lunatics, haters, bigots, and maniacs.\u201d He\u2019d also try to deport people who are in the U.S. legally but harbor \u201cjihadist sympathies.\u201d He\u2019d seek to end birthright citizenship for people born in the U.S. whose parents are both in the country illegally.",

        "text": "US elections 2024: Jill Stein leads with Muslim-American voters in three swing states, survey shows\nGreen Party candidate Jill Stein leads Kamala Harris among Muslim-American voters in the three key swing states of Michigan, Arizona and Wisconsin, according to a new poll.\n\nOverall, Vice President Kamala Harris and Jill Stein are the leading candidates in this year\u2019s presidential election among Muslim-American voters, according to data released by the Council on American Islamic Relations (Cair), the nation\u2019s leading voice on Muslim civil liberties.\n\nIn a survey conducted over two days in late August, 1,076 registered voters from around the country pitched in with their preferences \u2013 and despite the widespread anger directed toward the Biden administration and Democrats for bankrolling Israel\u2019s year-long war on Gaza, 29.4 percent of respondents said they will still vote for the party.\n\nBut hot on Harris\u2019 heels, 29.1 percent said they will vote for Stein, who has controversially said that what is happening in Gaza \u201cmakes any genocide pale by comparison\u201d and has made ending the war a key pillar of her party platform.\n\nIn the 2016 election, Stein won one percent of the overall vote. She was seen as a \u201cspoiler candidate\u201d who divided the liberal bloc by shifting support away from Hillary Clinton.\n\nNew MEE newsletter: Jerusalem Dispatch Sign up to get the latest insights and analysis on Israel-Palestine, alongside Turkey Unpacked and other MEE newsletters\n\nA sizable number of survey respondents remain undecided about the upcoming November election, with 16.5 percent saying they do not yet know who they will vote for.\n\nRepublican candidate and former President Donald Trump, who has said he will reimpose the so-called \u201cMuslim travel ban\u201d, received 11.2 percent support.\n\nCair says the results have a margin of error of +/- 2.95 percentage points at the 95 percent confidence level - meaning that if the survey were conducted multiple times, Cair expects the same results within the margin of error the vast majority of the time.\n\n\u201cWe are surprised to see that American Muslims are very much intent on voting, even though they don't seem very happy with all of the options before them,\u201d Cair\u2019s deputy national director Edward Ahmed Mitchell told Middle East Eye.\n\n\u201cAmerican Muslims have had much reason to become jaded and cynical about politics in recent years and decades. But they, by and large, recognise that your vote is your constitutional right, and it's your way to make things change for the better, even some of the most horrific things that you can imagine, like a genocide.\u201d\n\nA marked shift\n\nJust under nine percent of respondents to the survey said they do not plan on voting at all. Cair did not ask for the reasons behind the preferences.\n\nIn some swing states - those that are pivotal to the outcome of the election - Stein leads Harris by at least five percentage points or more, the survey shows. Those states are Arizona, Michigan, and Wisconsin.\n\nMichigan boasts the largest Arab and Muslim-American community in the country, where 40 percent of respondents contacted by Cair said they plan to vote for Stein.\n\nWisconsin, however, had the highest share of support for Stein at 44 percent.\n\nHarris retains a lead of some 20 percentage points in Georgia and Nevada, in addition to overall support among the youngest block of Muslim voters: those aged 18-29, which more or less mirrors national polling among the general electorate.\n\nJill Stein on America's democracy crisis, movement building and ending Israel's war on Palestinians Read More \u00bb\n\n\u201cThis election is still up for grabs,\u201d Mitchell told Middle East Eye. \u201cThe American Muslim community is not 100 percent decided we're going this way or that way. There still seems to be a great deal of flexibility and openness. If you look back to our polls from four years ago, the support for President Biden at the time was overwhelming, [but] now you see a much more diverse set of views.\u201d\n\nKhalil Jahshan, the Palestinian-American executive director of the Arab Center Washington DC, shares those sentiments.\n\n\u201cOne has to distinguish between those of us who are looking at it from a Middle East perspective - and looking essentially to see what role does Middle East policy play in this - [and] the Muslim community [writ large] unless it's specifically asked,\u201d Jahshan said.\n\n\u201cThe Arab American community is significantly different because Middle East policy is the key factor.\u201d\n\nThis may well be the first time that a US election is dramatically swayed by a foreign policy crisis, despite the insistence of some US lawmakers that only domestic issues can change results.\n\nThe unparalleled outpouring of support for the Palestinian cause around the country is a marked shift from the United States of 6 October 2023, Jahshan said.\n\n\u201cIt's a protest vote,\u201d he adds, regarding the swell of support for Stein. \u201cShe happens to be there at the right place, at the right time.\u201d",

        "text": "Is Russia trying to influence the US election? \u2013 DW \u2013 09\nAhead of the US presidential election, Washington has accused Russia of influencing voters \u2014 and not for the first time. Moscow is said to be trying to undermine the legitimacy of democratic elections worldwide.\n\nAmerican investigative authorities are probing the activities of a Tennessee firm alleged to have received $10 million (about \u20ac9 million) from the Russian state broadcaster RT to \"create and distribute content to US audiences with hidden Russian government messaging.\"\n\nThe money was reportedly used to produce videos which promoted right-wing narratives on issues such as immigration, gender and the economy ahead of the US presidential election on November 5.\n\nSeveral right-wing influencers who worked for the company then shared these videos on social media, allegedly without knowing that they were actually edited and produced by two employees of RT, formerly known as Russia Today.\n\nThe US called RT Editor-in-Chief Margarita Simonyan 'a central figure in Russian government malign influence efforts' Image: ITAR-TASS/IMAGO IMAGES\n\n\"While the views expressed in the videos are not uniform, most are directed to the publicly stated goals of the Government of Russia and RT \u2014 to amplify domestic divisions in the United States in order to weaken US opposition to [Russia's] core interests, such as its ongoing war in Ukraine,\" said the indictment by the US Justice Department, released on September 4.\n\nRussia 'trying to influence elections for years'\n\nThis latest case only provides a glimpse of how Russia is allegedly acting to meddle with global elections. Moscow, for its part, has repeatedly denied any accusations of interference.\n\n\"Russia has been trying to influence elections in democratic countries for years, such as the 2016 US presidential election or the 2017 French presidential election,\" said Julia Smirnova, a senior analyst at the Berlin-based Center for Monitoring, Analysis and Strategy, CeMAS, which researches conspiracy theories, disinformation, antisemitism and right-wing extremism.\n\nAs early as in October 2023, the US sent an intelligence report to 100 allied countries worldwide, according to which Russia was actively using \"spies, social networks and state media\" to undermine public confidence in the integrity of democratic elections worldwide.\n\nAccording to CeMAS, this was reported to have happened in at least nine different countries between 2020 and 2022. There was also a \"less pronounced level\" of Russian social media activity in 17 another countries, intended to reinforce preexisting domestic concerns about the integrity of the upcoming elections, Smirnova told DW.\n\nReports of Russian attempts to exert influence were also made during the European elections in June.\n\nIntimidation, disinformation, manipulation\n\nThe Russian tool kit for interference is believed to be extensive, according to CeMAS.\n\nIn an unspecified European election in 2020, campaigners were allegedly intimidated. And in 2020 and 2021, Russian state media is said to have massively disseminated false allegations of electoral fraud in democratic elections around the world.\n\nIn at least one South American country, Moscow also sowed massive doubts about the independence of the electoral process.\n\nUS moves to counter Russian influence in 2024 election To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\"This involves various methods such as hacker attacks in which internal documents of politicians are published, authentic or partially mixed with forged documents, such as in the 2017 French elections,\" said Smirnova. \"Russia also manipulates public opinions via social media with the help of fake accounts and public channels such as Russia Today.\"\n\nAnother example is the so-called doppelganger campaign. The central element, Smirnova explained, was \"cloned websites of major Western media\" such as the German media outlets Der Spiegel or Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, or US media like The Washington Post, Fox News and many others. These sites were deceptively similar to their real counterparts, except that they deliberately published pro-Russia content, she said.\n\n\"Some of these were made-up stories, but some were also articles that spread certain political opinions,\" said Smirnova.\n\nLinks to these fake articles were then posted on social media, sometimes even in the comments underneath real articles by established media outlets.\n\nAccording to the CeMAS analyst, these were often \"pro-Russian narratives about the war in Ukraine, as Russia is trying to undermine Western support for Ukraine.\"\n\nKremlin aiming to 'destabilize' democracies\n\nHowever, the aim of Russian interference is no longer just to spread and strengthen pro-Russian positions.\n\n\"The overarching goal is to promote Russia's geopolitical interests, and to destabilize the countries that the Kremlin perceives as Russia's opponents,\" said Smirnova.\n\nTo achieve this goal, she said, Russia is fueling polarizing debates and trying to push apart existing divisions within democratic societies as much as possible. The Kremlin is also strengthening parties on the political margins with financial contributions, and policy arguments.\n\nRussia hopes to weaken governments and societies which are not perceived as Russia-friendly, observers warn Image: James Atoa/UPI Photo/newscom/picture alliance\n\nThe Washington Post as early as 2022 that at least $300 million had been given to particularly Russia-friendly parties worldwide, including in smaller countries such as Albania, Montenegro, Madagascar and Ecuador.\n\nAccording to US intelligence agencies, Kremlin-linked sources also used shell companies, think tanks and other tools to influence political events, often in favor of far-right groups.\n\nAs recently as in March, the Czech secret service BIS uncovered a Russia-financed network that allegedly sent funds to Petr Bystron, a now former member of the German parliament for the far-right AfD. These payments were allegedly made via the Prague-based pro-Russia internet portal Voice of Europe.\n\nIt is also alleged that money flowed to extreme parties in France, Poland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Hungary.\n\nIn March 2024, the Czech secret service said a pro-Russia news site operating from Prague paid hundreds of thousands of euros to politicians, including Germany's AfD Image: ROBIN UTRECHT/picture alliance\n\nAwareness, media literacy is key\n\nAccording to the US intelligence report from October 2023, Russia is ultimately pursuing two goals: to portray democratic elections as untrustworthy, and delegitimize the elected governments that run them.\n\nThis, in turn, would destabilize the affected democracies and weaken Russia's opponents around the world.\n\nHowever, the countries in Russia's crosshairs aren't completely helpless.\n\n\"The US has demonstrated this by seizing 32 web domains last week that were used in the doppelganger campaign,\" said Smirnova.\n\nIn the long term, however, it's also about \"strengthening the resilience of democratic societies,\" she added.\n\nThis includes education programs to boost media literacy among young people and adults, so that they're aware that they too could very quickly become the target of Russian influence online, she said.\n\n\"In fact, Russia invests considerable resources in its campaigns around the world every year,\" said Smirnova, adding that \"these attempts should be taken very seriously but we should also be aware that Russia does not always achieve its goal with its influence attempts.\"\n\nThis article was originally written in German.",

        "text": "Presidential debate highlights: Harris and Trump spar over abortion, immigration and economy in first faceoff of 2024 race\nAnalysis\n\nIt\u2019s true that no one in the Biden administration was held accountable for the final withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan in August 2021, a chaotic event that resulted in 13 deaths.\n\nBut Trump and Biden share responsibility for the withdrawal and its consequences. Both publicly supported pulling U.S. troops out and rejected advice from military commanders to keep a small U.S. force on the ground.\n\nTrump and his supporters have tried to solely blame Biden and Harris for the chaotic pullout. The Biden administration, in a National Security Council report last year, tried to pin most of the blame on the Trump administration, arguing that Biden was \u201cseverely constrained\u201d by Trump\u2019s decisions.\n\nIn February 2020, the Trump administration negotiated an agreement with the Taliban that excluded the Afghan government, reduced U.S. troops levels from 12,500 to 2,500, freed 5,000 Taliban prisoners in a prisoner exchange and required all U.S. troops to withdraw by May 1, 2021.\n\nIn return, the U.S received an ambiguous pledge from the Taliban not to allow Afghanistan to become a base for terrorist attacks against the U.S. and its allies.\n\nTrump then scaled back U.S. troop levels over the course of 2020 from about 13,000 to 2,500 as part of the deal, even though the Taliban did not keep its commitment to reduce violence and it maintained ties with Al Qaeda. Republican lawmakers in November expressed alarm over the troop reductions, with Sen. Marco Rubio, of Florida, warning of a \u201cSaigon-type situation.\u201d\n\nThe February 2020 Doha agreement and the troop drawdown presented Biden with difficult choices. Some administration officials were concerned that if the U.S. chose to renege on the Doha agreement, the administration would have to deploy additional U.S. troops in Afghanistan to bolster the small contingent remaining. That, in turn, risked triggering an intensified war with the Taliban.\n\nThe head of U.S. Central Command, Gen. Frank McKenzie, recommended keeping a small force of 2,500 in place to counter the terrorist threat from the country and to support the Afghan army. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Gen. Mark Milley, agreed with the recommendation.\n\nBiden eventually moved up the timeline for full troop withdrawal to Aug. 31 (from Sept. 11) as the Taliban made dramatic advances across the country.\n\nIn August, Taliban forces seized Kabul without a fight, and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani fled the country amid chaotic scenes at the Kabul airport. Desperate Afghans climbed onto the wings of a U.S. cargo plane and fell from the sky after it took off.\n\nOn Aug. 26, a bombing at the airport\u2019s Abbey Gate during the final days of withdrawal killed 13 U.S. service members and 170 Afghans and wounded many more people. The attack was carried out by ISIS.",

Among likely voters, it is also Harris as the choice of 52% and Trump of 48%. These results include initially undecided voters who were then asked whom they would vote for if they had to choose.\n\nIn the Marquette Law School Poll\u2019s July survey of Wisconsin, Harris received 49% and Trump 50% among registered voters, with the numbers reversing to Harris at 50% and Trump\u2019s 49% among likely voters.\n\nIn a multicandidate race, Harris is the choice of 47% and Trump 43%, while Robert F. Kennedy Jr. receives 6%, Libertarian Chase Oliver 1%, Green Party candidate Jill Stein 1%, independent Cornel West 1%, and Constitution Party candidate Randall Terry 0% among registered voters. Among likely voters, it is Harris 48%, Trump 43%, Kennedy 6%, Oliver 1%, Stein 1%, Terry 1%, and West 1%.\n\nKennedy suspended his campaign on Aug. 23, prior to the poll\u2019s survey entering the field, but remains on the Wisconsin ballot. A large majority, 86%, said they had heard he had ended his campaign, while 14% had not heard.\n\nIn the U.S. Senate race, Sen. Tammy Baldwin is supported by 52% to Eric Hovde\u2019s 48% among registered voters. Among likely voters, Baldwin receives 52% and Hovde receives 47%. These results include initially undecided voters who were then asked whom they would vote for if they had to choose. When initially asked, Baldwin receives 48% and Hovde 44%, while 8% say they are undecided, among registered voters.\n\nWhen the Senate ballot includes independent candidates, Baldwin receives 51%, Hovde 45%, Phil Anderson (the \u201cDisrupt the Corruption\u201d party candidate) receives 2%, and Thomas Leager (of the \u201cAmerica First\u201d party) receives 2% among registered voters. Among likely voters, Baldwin receives 51% and Hovde 45%, with 2% for Anderson and 2% for Leager.\n\nThe survey was conducted Aug. 28-Sept. 5, 2024, interviewing 822 Wisconsin registered voters, with a margin of error of +/-4.6 percentage points, The survey included 738 likely voters, with a margin of error of +/-4.7 percentage points. (All results are stated as percentages.)\n\nWhile the race for president remains very close in Wisconsin, when asked who they think is likely to win in November, 48% say Harris will definitely or probably win, while 41% say Trump will definitely or probably win and 11% say they don\u2019t know. In July, by contrast, 39% said Harris would win, 51% said Trump would win, and 11% didn\u2019t know.\n\nSource of political division\n\nIn October 2013 we asked voters:\n\nWhich comes closer to your view about political divisions in Washington these days? Growing political divisions among elected officials reflect a more divided American society OR growing political divisions are mostly among elected officials and not American society in general?\n\nIn 2013, 38% said political divisions reflect a more divided society and 53% said divisions were mostly among elected officials.\n\nEleven years later, in September 2024, 65% say divisions are due to a more divided society, and 34% say divisions are mostly among elected officials.\n\nEnthusiasm and likelihood of voting\n\nEnthusiasm about voting this November increased sharply from June to July, as shown in Table 1. The July enthusiasm held in September, as 63% say they are very enthusiastic about voting, similar to 61% in July. For comparison, in the previous presidential cycle in early September 2020, 65% were very enthusiastic.\n\nTable 1: Enthusiasm to vote in November election\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nPoll dates Enthusiasm Very Somewhat Not too Not at all 8/28-9/5/24 63 20 12 6 7/24-8/1/24 61 21 15 4 6/12-20/24 46 21 19 14 4/3-10/24 47 22 18 12 1/24-31/24 49 25 17 9 10/26-11/2/23 46 28 19 6 8/30-9/3/20 65 19 9 6 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin surveys, latest: Aug. 28-Sept. 5, 2024 Question: (2024) How enthusiastic are you about voting in the elections in November 2024 for president and other offices? Would you say you are very, somewhat, not too, or not at all enthusiastic? Question: (2020) How enthusiastic are you about voting in this November\u2019s elections? Would you say you are very, somewhat, not too, or not at all enthusiastic?\n\nDemocrats now more enthusiastic than Republicans\n\nEnthusiasm has increased among Democrats. In the September survey, 72% say they are \u201cvery enthusiastic\u201d about voting. That is substantially higher than in June, when 40% were \u201cvery enthusiastic.\u201d The percentage of \u201cvery enthusiastic\u201d Republicans rose from 57% in June to 64% in July and declined by 1 percentage point to 63% in September. Republicans held a substantial enthusiasm advantage over Democrats in June, which Democrats have now erased.\n\nIndependents are less enthusiastic than supporters of either party. Enthusiasm among independents rose from June to July but declined in September to a single point higher than in June. These results are shown in Table 2.\n\nTable 2: Enthusiasm to vote in November election, by party identification\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nPoll dates Enthusiasm Very Somewhat Not too Not at all Democrat 8/28-9/5/24 72 19 8 2 7/24-8/1/24 62 19 15 4 6/12-20/24 40 24 20 16 Independent 8/28-9/5/24 31 29 24 14 7/24-8/1/24 37 20 26 17 6/12-20/24 30 17 23 29 Republican 8/28-9/5/24 63 19 11 7 7/24-8/1/24 64 22 12 1 6/12-20/24 57 19 16 8 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin surveys, latest: Aug. 28-Sept. 5, 2024 Question: (2024) How enthusiastic are you about voting in the elections in November 2024 for president and other offices? Would you say you are very, somewhat, not too, or not at all enthusiastic?\n\nHarris leads among the very or somewhat enthusiastic\n\nThose who are very or somewhat enthusiastic give Harris a lead, while those who are not too enthusiastic only slightly prefer Harris and those not at all enthusiastic give Trump a large margin, as shown in Table 3. This reverses the pattern when President Joe Biden was the Democratic candidate. Biden trailed Trump among the more enthusiastic voters but held an advantage among with those who were less enthusiastic.\n\nTable 3: Vote for Harris or Trump, by enthusiasm\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nEnthusiasm Vote choice 2024 Kamala Harris Donald Trump Very enthusiastic 53 47 Somewhat enthusiastic 53 47 Not too enthusiastic 51 49 Not at all enthusiastic 35 64 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin survey, Aug. 28-Sept. 5, 2024 Question: If the 2024 election for president were held today between Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democrat, and former President Donald Trump, the Republican, would you vote for Kamala Harris or for Donald Trump or haven\u2019t you decided? Question: If you had to choose, would you vote for Harris or for Trump? Question: How enthusiastic are you about voting in the elections in November 2024 for president and other offices? Would you say you are very, somewhat, not too, or not at all enthusiastic?\n\nFavorability to presidential and vice-presidential candidates\n\nHarris is seen favorably by 47% and unfavorably by 51% of registered voters, with 2% saying they don\u2019t know enough about her to have an opinion. In July, Harris was seen favorably by 41% and unfavorably by 53%, with 6% who didn\u2019t have an opinion.\n\nIn September, favorability toward Trump was virtually unchanged from July, with 43% favorable, 56% unfavorable, and less than 1% without an opinion. In July, his favorability was 44% and unfavorability 54%, with 2% lacking an opinion.\n\nFavorability toward Biden remains low at 42% favorable with his unfavorable rating at 57%. In July, he was seen favorably by 40% and unfavorably by 57%.\n\nThose with unfavorable opinions of both candidates, the so-called \u201cdouble haters,\u201d declined from July to September. For Harris and Trump, 11% had an unfavorable view of both in July and 8% in September. In September, 46% have a favorable view of Harris and an unfavorable view to Trump, while 42% have a favorable view of Trump and an unfavorable one of Harris. Less than 0.5% have a favorable view of both. Negative opinions of both Biden and Trump declined by 1 percentage point from July to September, to 13%.\n\nVice-presidential candidates\n\nDemocratic vice-presidential candidate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is viewed favorably by 43% and unfavorably by 37%, with 19% saying they haven\u2019t heard enough or don\u2019t know.\n\nWalz is seen quite favorably by Democrats and quite unfavorably by Republicans. Independents have a more favorable than unfavorable opinion of Walz. A substantial percentage of each group say they haven\u2019t heard enough about Walz; this is especially so among independents, as shown in Table 4.\n\nTable 4: Walz favorability, by party identification\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nParty ID Favorability Favorable Unfavorable Haven't heard enough Republican 6 72 21 Independent 41 27 31 Democrat 84 3 13 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin survey, Aug. 28-Sept. 5, 2024 Question: Do you have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of <> or haven't you heard enough about them yet?\n\nWalz is seen as an excellent pick for the vice-president slot by 29%, as a good choice by 18%, as a fair choice by 10%, and as a poor selection by 33%, with 11% who say they don\u2019t know. Among Democrats, 90% rate the choice of Walz as excellent or good, while half of independents say it is excellent or good and most Republicans rate it poor, as shown in Table 5.\n\nTable 5: Walz as VP pick, by party identification\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nParty ID Rate choice of Walz as VP Excellent Good Fair Poor Don't know Republican 3 4 11 67 15 Independent 26 24 13 21 16 Democrat 59 31 7 0 4 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin survey, Aug. 28-Sept. 5, 2024 Question: How would you rate Harris\u2019 choice of Walz for vice president? Would you rate this choice as excellent, good, fair, or poor?\n\nRepublican vice-presidential nominee Ohio Sen. JD Vance is seen favorably by 37% and unfavorably by 47%, with 16% saying they haven\u2019t heard enough or don\u2019t know. Vance is seen much more favorably by Republicans but is viewed unfavorably by independents and especially by Democrats, as shown in Table 6. Substantial percentages of each partisan group, and especially independents, say they have not yet formed an opinion of Vance.\n\nTable 6: Vance favorability, by party identification\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nParty ID Favorability Favorable Unfavorable Haven't heard enough Republican 75 8 17 Independent 22 48 29 Democrat 1 90 9 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin survey, Aug. 28-Sept. 5, 2024 Question: Do you have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of <> or haven't you heard enough about them yet?\n\nFavorability of all presidential and vice-presidential candidates\n\nTable 7 shows the favorability ratings, including those for third-party candidates for president and for Walz and Vance. Walz is the only candidate with a positive net favorability rating. Kennedy is the best known of the third-party candidates, all of whom are less well known than Harris or Trump.\n\nTable 7: Favorability of all national candidates\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nCandidate Favorability Net fav Favorable Unfavorable Haven't heard enough Harris -4 47 51 2 Trump -13 43 56 0 Vance -10 37 47 16 Walz 6 43 37 19 Kennedy -8 38 46 16 Oliver -5 1 6 90 Stein -19 9 28 62 Terry -4 1 5 91 West -10 9 19 70 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin survey, Aug. 28-Sept. 5, 2024 Question: Do you have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of <> or haven't you heard enough about them yet?\n\nWalz and Vance are about equally well known, with 19% saying they haven\u2019t heard enough about Walz and 16% saying the same for Vance. Walz, though, is better known in the western parts of Wisconsin, where some areas are included in media markets for Minneapolis-St. Paul and Duluth-Superior. In addition, the La Crosse-Eau Claire market carries some Minnesota political advertising and news coverage. Among Wisconsin voters in those three media markets, 13% say they haven\u2019t heard enough about Walz, compared to 20% in the rest of the state\u2019s media markets who haven\u2019t heard enough about him. He is viewed favorably by 33% and unfavorably by 54% in the western media markets, which are more Republican-leaning than the state as a whole, while in the other markets his favorable rating is 45% and his unfavorable rating is 35%.\n\nCharacteristics of Harris and Trump\n\nThe perceived characteristics of Harris and of Trump are shown in Table 8. More people see Trump as having strong accomplishments, and the two candidates are virtually tied on being a strong leader. More see Trump as too old to be president and as having behaved corruptly.\n\nMore people see Harris than Trump as intelligent and honest, as having the right temperament and communications skills, and as sharing the respondent\u2019s values.\n\nTable 8: How well does this phrase describe Harris or Trump\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nCandidate How well phrase describes Very/somewhat well Not too/not at all well Is too old to be president Harris 15 85 Trump 59 40 Shares your values Harris 51 49 Trump 45 55 Has behaved corruptly Harris 38 61 Trump 62 37 Strong record of accomplishments Harris 46 53 Trump 53 47 Has the right temperament to be president Harris 57 43 Trump 42 57 Is a strong leader Harris 52 48 Trump 54 46 Is intelligent Harris 58 42 Trump 53 47 Is honest Harris 53 47 Trump 41 58 Has communications skills to be president Harris 54 46 Trump 48 52 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin survey, Aug. 28-Sept. 5, 2024 Question: How well does each of the following phrases describe (Kamala Harris)(Donald Trump)?\n\nIssues in the presidential campaign\n\nTable 9 shows which candidate is thought to do a better job on each of eight issues. Trump is seen as better on immigration and border security, the Israel-Hamas war, the economy, and, with a slight edge, handling foreign relations. Harris is seen as better on abortion policy, ensuring fair and accurate elections, health care, and Medicare & Social Security.\n\nBetween 8% and 18% say both candidates would be about the same or that neither would be good on each issue.\n\nTable 9: Which candidate would do a better job on issues\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nIssue Who better Harris Trump Both about the same Neither good Immigration and border security 35 52 6 7 Israel-Hamas war in Gaza 37 45 8 10 The economy 42 50 5 3 Foreign relations 43 46 6 5 Medicare & Social Security 48 38 7 7 Health care 49 36 6 9 Ensuring fair and accurate elections 50 37 6 7 Abortion policy 51 36 5 8 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin survey, Aug. 28-Sept. 5, 2024 Question: Do you think Kamala Harris or Donald Trump would do a better job handling each of the following issues, they are both about the same or would neither be good on the issue?\n\nMost important issues\n\nRespondents were asked which of the eight issues would be most important for deciding their vote. The economy is the top-rated issue by a large margin, followed by abortion policy and immigration, as shown in Table 10.\n\nTable 10: Most important issues\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nResponse Percent The economy 41 Abortion policy 15 Immigration and border security 12 Medicare & Social Security 9 Ensuring fair and accurate elections 9 Health care 5 Foreign relations 3 The war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza 2 Don't know 3 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin survey, Aug. 28-Sept. 5, 2024 Question: Which one of the following issues will be MOST important in deciding your vote for president?\n\nPartisans differ on which issues are the most important, as shown in Table 11. Republicans are much more likely to rank the economy and immigration as most important, while placing little weight on any of the other issues. Independents rank the economy as most important with Medicare & Social Security a distant second. Democrats put abortion policy as their top concern, with the economy just one percentage point lower, followed by Medicare & Social Security.\n\nTable 11: Most important issues, by party identification\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nParty ID Issue The economy Immigration and border security Healthcare Foreign relations Abortion policy Medicare & Social Security The war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza Ensuring fair and accurate elections Don't know Republican 55 23 2 3 6 2 1 5 1 Independent 42 7 7 3 8 12 6 7 9 Democrat 26 0 9 2 27 16 3 13 4 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin survey, Aug. 28-Sept. 5, 2024 Question: Which one of the following issues will be MOST important in deciding your vote for president?\n\nOpinion on deporting immigrants\n\nSupport for deporting immigrants who are in the United States illegally varies depending on the framing of the issue. A random half-sample of the survey was asked:\n\nDo you favor or oppose deporting immigrants who are living in the United States illegally back to their home countries?\n\nWith this wording, 65% favor deportation and 35% are opposed.\n\nThe other half-sample was asked:\n\nDo you favor or oppose deporting immigrants who are living in the United States illegally back to their home countries even if they have lived here for a number of years, have jobs and no criminal record?\n\nWhen worded this way, 49% favor deportations and 51% are opposed.\n\nOpinion on abortion\n\nTwo-thirds of registered voters say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, and one third say it should be illegal in all or most cases. This has changed little since Roe v. Wade was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court in June 2022. The full trend is shown in Table 12.\n\nTable 12: Abortion opinion trend\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nPoll dates Opinion Legal in all cases Legal in most cases Illegal in most cases Illegal in all cases Don't know 8/28-9/5/24 31 35 28 5 0 7/24-8/1/24 33 34 27 5 1 6/12-20/24 34 32 26 8 0 4/3-10/24 28 36 26 9 1 6/8-13/23 32 34 25 6 1 8/10-15/22 30 35 25 5 3 6/14-20/22 27 31 24 11 5 10/26-31/21 23 38 23 11 4 2/19-23/20 18 37 22 15 6 10/24-28/18 26 29 24 14 4 9/12-16/18 26 36 21 9 6 7/11-15/18 27 36 18 11 6 10/23-26/14 24 34 24 15 3 10/21-24/13 26 36 25 10 2 10/25-28/12 28 32 23 12 4 10/11-14/12 25 34 25 12 3 9/27-30/12 25 35 23 12 3 9/13-16/12 26 34 23 13 3 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin survey, Aug. 28-Sept. 5, 2024 Question: Do you think abortion should be legal in all cases, legal in most cases, illegal in most cases, or illegal in all cases?\n\nPerceived candidate ideology\n\nHarris is seen as very liberal by 52%, and Trump is seen as very conservative by 53%. Harris is seen as moderate by 16%, while 10% see Trump that way.\n\nFor the vice-presidential candidates, 45% see Walz as very liberal, while 61% see Vance as very conservative. Twice the number see Walz as moderate, 21%, as see Vance this way, 10%.\n\nIn contrast to their views of the candidates, voters see themselves as closer to the center, with 34% describing themselves as moderate. Eleven percent say of themselves that they are very liberal and 14% say very conservative. The full set of results is shown in Table 13.\n\nTable 13: Perceived candidate ideology\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nCandidate Ideology Very conservative Somewhat conservative Moderate Somewhat liberal Very liberal Harris 3 2 16 27 52 Trump 53 32 10 2 3 Walz 1 3 21 29 45 Vance 61 24 10 2 2 Self-description 14 25 34 16 11 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin survey, Aug. 28-Sept. 5, 2024 Question: In general, would you describe each of the following as\u2026? Question: In general, would you describe your political views as...\n\nVote by ideology\n\nPresidential vote is closely aligned with the respondent\u2019s self-described ideology, though there is slightly more conservative support for Harris than liberal support for Trump, as shown in Table 14. Moderates provide a substantial majority for Harris. Overall, there are more conservatives, 39%, than liberals, 27%, while moderates make up 34%.\n\nTable 14: Vote by political ideology\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nSelf-description Vote Kamala Harris Donald Trump Very conservative 8 92 Somewhat conservative 12 88 Moderate 63 37 Somewhat liberal 95 5 Very liberal 100 0 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin survey, Aug. 28-Sept. 5, 2024 Question: In general, would you describe your political views as...

Question: If you had to choose, would you vote for [Harris] or for [Trump]?\n\nThird-party vote trends\n\nThe trend in vote preference when including independent and third-party candidates is shown in Table 15. The total third-party vote has declined from 22% in January to 9% in September, with Kennedy falling from 16% to 6% over that time among registered voters. The current level of total third-party voting in the survey is higher than the recent high in actual votes of 5.5% in 2016 and much higher than the 1.5% in 2020. Oliver was not included prior to the June poll and Terry appeared for the first time in July.\n\nTable 15: Vote including third-party candidates\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nPoll dates Vote choice Harris Biden Trump Kennedy Oliver Stein Terry West 8/28-9/5/24 47 NA 43 6 1 1 <.5 1 7/24-8/1/24 45 NA 43 8 1 1 <.5 <.5 6/12-20/24 NA 40 43 8 2 2 NA 4 4/3-10/24 NA 40 41 13 NA 3 NA 2 1/24-31/24 NA 37 40 16 NA 4 NA 2 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin survey, latest: Aug. 28-Sept. 5, 2024 Question: If the presidential ballot included additional candidates, would you vote for Democrat Kamala Harris, Republican Donald Trump, independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Libertarian Chase Oliver, the Green Party\u2019s Jill Stein, Constitution Party\u2019s Randall Terry, or independent Cornel West?\n\nIn the multicandidate ballot test in September, Kennedy receives more votes from Republicans, 8%, than from Democrats, 3%. Kennedy has consistently drawn more votes from Republicans than from Democrats throughout the year.\n\nIndependent voters are especially drawn to the third-party candidates. Kennedy receives 13% from independents, Oliver 3%, Stein 3%, Terry 2%, and West 1%. Among independents in the multicandidate race, Trump receives 28% and Harris 50%, a substantial shift from July.\n\nThese results are shown in Table 16.\n\nTable 16: Multicandidate ballot by party identification\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nParty ID Vote choice Harris Trump Kennedy Oliver Stein Terry West Don't know 8/28-9/5/24 Republican 3 86 8 1 1 1 0 0 Independent 50 28 13 3 3 2 1 0 Democrat 94 0 3 0 1 0 2 0 7/24-8/1/24 Republican 4 85 10 0 0 0 0 0 Independent 35 38 21 3 2 0 1 0 Democrat 91 1 4 2 2 0 0 0 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin survey, Aug. 28-Sept. 5, 2024 Question: If the presidential ballot included additional candidates, would you vote for Democrat Kamala Harris, Republican Donald Trump, independent Robert F.

        "text": "The Trump-Harris Debate Ignored Asia/China, and That\u2019s Bad News\nThe most recent presidential debate failed to address U.S. foreign policy toward Asia substantively. Even the most crucial issue\u2014U.S.-China relations\u2014was barely mentioned. The only reference to China regarded the competition to develop a domestic semiconductor chip industry and tariffs on Chinese goods. In contrast, other vital issues in Asia, such as the South China Sea, U.S.-India relations, the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, and North Korea, were overlooked entirely. There was little discussion about the growing possibility of a dangerous U.S.-China interaction in the South China Sea or how the United States is working to build stronger alliances and partnerships in South and Southeast Asia, starting with the Philippines, a key ally.\n\nThe increasingly tense situation around Taiwan, the growing U.S. commitment to Taiwan, and Taiwan\u2019s closer ties to other U.S. partners in the region, such as Japan, were not discussed. This oversight is notable given that Trump has previously expressed disdain for Taiwan and criticized its semiconductor industry. There was also no substantial discussion of the efforts to block China from accessing high-end chips, China\u2019s burgeoning AI industry, industrial competition, or China\u2019s increasingly close ties with Russia and the informal yet emerging authoritarian nexus between them. Additionally, the debate omitted North Korea\u2019s extreme belligerence, continued attempts to develop advanced technology, and supply of weaponry to repressive states like Myanmar and Russia.\n\nMoreover, the debate did not address the significant backsliding in rights and democracy across Asia. The increasingly repressive atmosphere in autocratic states like China and the erosion of democratic norms in countries like Indonesia, coupled with China\u2019s use of transnational influence and repression, pose critical challenges to U.S. policy in the region.\n\nAsia Unbound CFR fellows and other experts assess the latest issues emerging in Asia today. 1-3 times weekly.

That was not the case this time. Since there will not be another debate, and this one lasted only ninety minutes, some of these oversights seem particularly significant.",

What would you like us to cover? Get in touch.\n\nAt the debate in Philadelphia Tuesday, a moderator asked Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump a question with implications for the future of public health, safety and the economy: What would they do to fight climate change if elected president?\n\nNeither candidate directly answered the question.\n\nHarris acknowledged the impact of climate change on Americans, saying, \u201cit is very real.\u201d\n\n\u201cAsk anyone who lives in a state who has experienced these extreme weather occurrences,\u201d she said.\n\nHarris talked about investments in clean energy under the current Biden administration, but stopped short of describing her own plan for tackling climate change if elected president.\n\nTrump used his time responding to the question to attack the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s record on manufacturing jobs. He promised to put tariffs on foreign-made cars \u201cso they can\u2019t come into our country,\u201d but did not tie the issue back to reducing planet-warming emissions.\n\nTrump has called climate change a hoax\n\nDuring the debate, Harris said \u2014 accurately \u2014 that Trump has called climate change a \u201choax.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, Trump repeatedly used the word to describe global warming on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter. In a 2015 speech, Trump called global warming \u201ca money-making industry.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of it\u2019s a hoax,\u201d he said.\n\nBut later, in a 2020 debate, he said he believed human pollution contributes to warming \u201cto an extent.\u201d\n\nScientists say it\u2019s unequivocal that the atmosphere, land and oceans have warmed as a result of human influence.",

        "text": "The 2024 Presidential Election: Five Things Every College Student Should Know\nAs the 2024 presidential election is only months away with Election Day on November 5, 2024, college students around the country have the unique opportunity to cast their ballots to shape the future of our nation. Whether it\u2019s a student\u2019s first time voting, or they\u2019re seasoned pros when it comes to exercising their democratic right, there are several important things to be mindful of before heading to the polls. Here are the top 5 things to know.\n\n1. Why Voting Matters\n\nSometimes, the policies made by our lawmakers don\u2019t seem to affect our day-to-day lives, but this is not the case. Every choice made by our government on both the national and local levels directly impact all of us. The amount of taxes that you pay, your access to healthcare and social services, the safety of the food you eat and the water you drink, and even the price of the products you see on the shelves at your local supermarket are influenced by the decisions of our political leadership. Voting gives citizens the opportunity to impact all these factors and more by helping to choose leaders that represent their values and ideologies. Voting is the only direct way to let your voice be heard by our elected officials and to hold our leaders accountable for their future decisions.\n\n2. Don\u2019t Delay, Register to Vote Today\n\nRegistering to vote is easier than you might think. First, check to ensure you meet the basic requirements as you must be at least 18 years old by at the time of the election a U.S. citizen, and a resident of the state you\u2019re planning to vote in for at least 30 days before the election. Each state has differing deadlines for voter registration and absentee ballot requests so if you aren\u2019t a New York state resident, check out your home state\u2019s requirements. If you meet the criteria listed above, you can register to vote with just a few clicks or get more information about where you can register to vote in person.\n\n3. What Are the Candidate\u2019s Positions on Key Policy Issues?\n\n\n\nPolitical views can be complicated, and it\u2019s important to conduct your own research about what each of the candidates thinks. Check out what Kamala Harris has to say about expanding access to affordable healthcare and criminal justice reform, and the policies of Donald Trump on American businesses, workers and more.\n\n4. What Else is on the Ballot?\n\nBesides choosing the next president, voters have the power to influence many important choices that will have a direct impact on their local communities. Two important items that will be on the ballot if you live anywhere in New York are the U.S. Senate election and a proposed amendment to the New York State Constitution regarding equal protection. If you live near the 3 Times Square campus in NYC, you can also vote in the U.S. House of Representatives election (District 12), the New York State Senate election (District 28), the New York State Assembly election (District 75), and the New York City Civil Court election. You can see the ballot specific to your local area, but remember that what you see on your ballot depends on where you reside.\n\n5. Where Can I Get More Information About the Election?\n\nCasting your vote for the next president is not something that should be taken lightly. It\u2019s imperative that college students remain informed and educated on an array of vital issues, so they\u2019re empowered to vote in the upcoming election with confidence.",

In addition, any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, individually or in the aggregate, 50 percent or more by one or more blocked persons are also blocked. Unless authorized by a general or specific license issued by OFAC, or exempt, OFAC\u2019s regulations generally prohibit all transactions by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in property of designated or otherwise blocked persons. U.S. persons may face civil or criminal penalties for violations of E.O. 13692. Non-U.S. persons are also prohibited from causing or conspiring to cause U.S. persons to wittingly or unwittingly violate U.S. sanctions, as well as engaging in conduct that evades U.S. sanctions. OFAC\u2019s Economic Sanctions Enforcement Guidelines provide more information regarding OFAC\u2019s enforcement of U.S. sanctions, including the factors that OFAC generally considers when determining an appropriate response to an apparent violation.\n\nIn addition, financial institutions and other persons that engage in certain transactions or activities with the sanctioned entities and individuals may expose themselves to sanctions or be subject to an enforcement action. The prohibitions include the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any designated person, or the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.\n\nThe power and integrity of OFAC sanctions derive not only from OFAC\u2019s ability to designate and add persons to the SDN List, but also from its willingness to remove persons from the SDN List consistent with the law. The ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish, but to bring about a positive change in behavior. For information concerning the process for seeking removal from an OFAC list, including the SDN List, please refer to OFAC\u2019s Frequently Asked Question 897 here. For detailed information on the process to submit a request for removal from an OFAC sanctions list, please click here.\n\nClick here for more information on the individuals identified today.\n\n###",

        "text": "Gen Zers who follow politics and media trend toward Kamala Harris, study finds\nKey takeaways\n\nHarris motivates non-voters. Almost half of Gen Z respondents in a UCLA study said they were not motivated to vote at all in the 2024 presidential election prior to Kamala Harris\u2019 nomination. A third of that group now says they are motivated to vote for Harris.\n\nTuned-in voters favor Harris. Over half of Gen Z respondents who stay informed about the news indicate they will vote for Harris, while almost three-quarters of those who don\u2019t follow the news say they will not vote for Harris or are unsure of who they will vote for.\n\nShift from identity politics? 82.7% of Gen Z respondents cited reasons other than Harris\u2019 racial or gender identity to explain their motivation to vote for her; 77.7% of Black Gen Z respondents expressed confidence in the political system to serve their interests.\n\nToday\u2019s young people are chronically online, and it appears that their media consumption is having an impact on their political views and likelihood to vote, according to a new study released by the UCLA Center for Scholars & Storytellers.\n\nGen Z (ages 16-27) and millennial (ages 28-40) participants who frequently consume media \u2013 defined in the survey as social media, television, streaming services and video games \u2013 report motivation to vote for Vice President Kamala Harris for president at higher rates (18% more) than those who report not using media at all. In addition, 29.3% of Gen Z respondents who said they were not motivated to vote in the upcoming election before the change in the Democratic nominee say they are now motivated to vote for Harris, who has a notable social media presence.\n\nMore than half (56.4%) of Gen Z respondents reported staying very informed on all news or news related to their communities, while only 16% of Gen Z respondents said they don\u2019t follow the news. And more than half (57%) of those Gen Zers informed about the news expressed interest in voting for Harris, while 70% of those who don\u2019t follow the news said they will not vote for Harris or are unsure of who they will vote for.\n\n\u201cYoung adults are increasingly getting news from TikTok, reporting social media as the most authentic form of media,\u201d said Yalda Uhls, the center\u2019s founder and CEO, co-author of the study and adjunct professor in UCLA\u2019s Department of Psychology. \u201cOur data shows that young people are very engaged with what\u2019s happening in the political sphere around them, and keeping up with the news seems to be influencing their desire to vote for Kamala Harris.\u201d\n\nThe report, a part of a regular \u201cTeen Snapshot\u201d series by the center which aims to gather quick pulses on how young people are responding to current events, surveyed 1,653 participants ages 16-40 in August 2024. Respondents closely reflected the U.S. Census in terms of race and gender. The survey was supported by the Funders for Adolescent Science Translation consortium.\n\nFor young people interested in voting for Harris, her identity as a woman of color didn\u2019t seem to be a huge motivating factor. In fact, 82.7% of Gen Z respondents cited reasons other than Harris\u2019 racial or gender identity to explain their support for her, including \u201cI agree with her stance on most issues,\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s an exciting candidate that gives me hope\u201d and \u201cI like what I\u2019ve seen about her on social media.\u201d\n\n\u201cContrary to Republican messaging about Kamala Harris being a DEI hire, young people seem more excited about her candidacy because of the tone and substance of her campaign rather than because of her race, ethnicity or gender,\u201d said Alisha Hines, the center\u2019s director of research and lead author of the study. \u201cThis finding makes sense in light of previous research from our 2023 Teens and Screens Report, which showed that young people are overwhelmingly interested in stories of hope \u2014 a defining mood of the Harris campaign.\u201d\n\nResults from the study also showed more diversity across party lines, with 15.5% of Black Gen Zers and 16.5% of Black millennials identifying as Republican (a far larger portion than Black adults, who have only made up 1-2% of the Republican party since 2016). Young Black Gen Zers overwhelmingly expressed confidence in the political system; when asked how confident they are in the political system to take care of them and their family\u2019s interests, 77.7% of African American Gen Z respondents indicated they were either \u201csomewhat confident\u201d or \u201cvery confident.\u201d This finding was a stark contrast to another recent poll featuring older generations which found two-thirds of Black Americans believe the U.S. political system was designed to hold them back.\n\n\u201cFor young people today who grew up seeing Barack Obama in the White House, diversity is the norm, not the exception,\u201d Uhls said. \u201cThese findings indicate a shift in how the next generation is moving away from identity politics and polarization, possibly towards an exciting new era of collaboration and consensus across party lines.\u201d",

The BBC has spoken to eight undecided voters who saw Tuesday night's 90-minute debate as being crucial in working out who to pick in November's ballot.\n\nVanessa was leaning towards voting for Trump before the debate started and is still leaning that way, but was impressed with Harris's performance. I don't think the debate changed my opinion on voting for Trump, but I definitely am less fearful if [Harris] wins because I think she can handle herself and debate well. I'm overall unchanged, but I like her better now. I lost a lot of faith in the Democratic Party when they told us Joe Biden was fine, and then it turns out he's not, and so it's hard to trust that same administration going forward. I do not want to vote for Trump, but I do not like this current administration. I won't change my mind before November, I'd just be less worried if she were to win.\n\nJeremy doesn't like Trump and didn't vote Democrat in 2016 or 2020, but after tonight's debate says he will be voting for Harris. Tonight was the first night where genuinely, I would say I felt, like, scared at the prospect of a second Trump presidency. His answers where he would fearmonger about immigrants killing dogs, fearmonger about World War III multiple times. Every time he spoke, it was frightening to a level that I have not felt from him before. And while I don't love Harris, and I think she's very wishy-washy, she does not pose an existential threat to America like he does.\n\nTracy watched the debate but remains undecided over who she will vote for. I thought both candidates spoke fairly well, but I thought Kamala answered more of the questions than Trump did. I had never really seen anything about [Harris] so I was looking for basically an opinion on her. So I was rather pleased with some of what she had to say and actually what ex-President Trump had to say, but I get a very shifty vibe from him. I don't trust [Trump]. I don't think he wants to run the country, I think he wants to own the country.\n\nMat was considering skipping the election all together, but after the debate he says he has made up his mind. The debate was something. Kamala Harris definitely did very well. I think Trump kind of did not. He lost his focus and kept rambling on where it was kind of incoherent. After last night, I think I'll vote for Kamala Harris. I don't know if I'll be very enthusiastic about it but I will probably be voting for her. There's still a little bit of time until November, but she very likely has my vote.\n\nIf I could vote for no one, I probably would do that. I want to get the full facts before I do anything. [I was] not impressed with Trump, I won't be voting for him.\n\nTrump was all over the place. He was lured into a lot of questions that he should have answered perfectly like immigration and abortion, but he was caught off guard with statements about crowd size, which was really revealing. I felt like Kamala was far more prepared for this than Donald Trump. I personally want to see her in more one-on-one interviews after this, this is the first time I'm seeing her without Tim Walz and she did fine, in my opinion. If she went out there more, spoke to the nation one-on-one more, she'd receive my vote at that point.\n\nRohan remains undecided, but says after the debate he's 51% for Harris and 49% for Trump. Still, he says, there's still time for that to change. The debate did very little to change my perspective of Trump. This was more an audition for Kamala Harris to just kind of see who she is, where she stands on policies and her command of the stage. She came across pretty rehearsed to me, but she dropped a lot of, sort of, baited statements that I think Trump bit on really hard - rattled him a bit, made him pretty angry. All of this seemed pretty calculated to me, and that's not exactly what I was looking for out of her. I was looking for her to be a little more personable, a little more natural.\n\nChance wasn't very impressed with the debate performances and still remains undecided. I didn't feel like the topics were discussed in depth, it was mostly the candidates talking at each other. I was disappointed, really. I personally wished they would go in depth about their policy, instead of attacking the other person for something about their policy. I'm personally not a fan of either of them, but if I was going to choose one or the other, I would probably choose Harris.

        "text": "Fact checking debate claims from Trump and Harris' 2024 presidential faceoff\nFormer President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris faced off in their first presidential debate on Tuesday, and challenged each other over their plans for the nation and the economy. The 90-minute debate was hosted by ABC News at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia.\n\nCBS News' Confirmed team fact-checked the comments Harris and Trump made about each other and about their own records and plans.\n\nFalse: Trump claims \"millions and millions of people\" are \"pouring into our country monthly\"\n\nTrump: \"[W]hen you look at what she's done to our country, and when you look at these millions (and) millions of people that are pouring into our country monthly, where it's, I believe 21 million people, not the 15 that people that say. And I think it's a lot higher than the 21. That's bigger than New York state. Pouring in. And just look at what they're doing to our country.\"\n\nDetails: Encounters of migrants by Customs and Border Protection at the U.S.-Mexico border have reached record levels in the past four years, under the Biden administration. But the number isn't close to the figures cited by Trump, and not everyone who has crossed the border under Mr. Biden has been allowed to stay.\n\nCBP has recorded over 8 million encounters with migrants at the southern border since Mr. Biden took office in 2021, federal figures show. Encounters include migrants who cross into the country illegally between legal entry points and those processed at these official crossings, known as ports of entry. Encounters do not represent unique individuals, since some migrants cross the border illegally multiple times.\n\nCBP has never recorded \"millions\" of migrant encounters in a month. The highest monthly migrant encounter tally was recorded in December 2023, when CBP processed over 300,000 migrants.\n\nIn addition to those processed by CBP, there are migrants who successfully cross the southern border illegally without being caught. Border Patrol estimates that 1.7 million migrants have evaded apprehension since the start of fiscal year 2021.\n\nJust because migrants were processed by CBP does not mean they were allowed to stay. Many have been released into the U.S. with notices to appear in immigration court. But the U.S. has also turned away or deported over 4 million migrants since the start of fiscal year 2021, according to Department of Homeland Security data.\n\nBy Camilo Montoya Galvez\n\nPartially true, needs context: Harris claims Trump would enact $4,000 \"sales tax\"\n\nHarris: \"Economists have said that Trump sales tax would actually result \u2014 for middle class families \u2014 in about $4,000 more a year because of his policies and his ideas about what should be \u2014 [on] the backs of middle class people paying for tax cuts for billionaires.\"\n\nDetails: Harris is citing an estimate of potential costs if Trump were to implement tariffs on imported goods. Trump has advocated for a tariff of at least 10% on most imports and a tariff of at least 60% on Chinese imports.\n\nHowever, estimates of the potential costs and the likely scale of the tariffs vary. An analysis from the Center for American Progress Action, a progressive policy institute, estimated that a 20% tariff on most imports, combined with a 60% tax on Chinese goods, would amount to a tax increase of around $3,900 annually for middle-income families.\n\nThe Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank, estimated that a 10% worldwide tariff and a 60% tariff on Chinese goods would lower average after-tax incomes by about $1,800 in 2025.\n\nEconomists told CBS News that everyday consumers would bear the brunt of higher import tariffs through increased prices on goods, effectively acting as a tax. In an interview with The New York Times, Robert Lighthizer, who served as Trump's chief trade negotiator and still advises his campaign on trade issues, said the burden on American households could be offset by tax cuts.\n\nBy Emma Li\n\nMostly true: Harris claims 16 Nobel laureate economists said Trump's economic plan \"would increase inflation\" and \"invite a recession\" by mid-2025\n\nHarris: \"Sixteen Nobel laureates have described [Trump's] economic plan as something that would increase inflation and by the middle of next year, would invite a recession.\"\n\nDetails: Harris' statement that 16 of the world's most notable economists, all Nobel laureates, warned in a letter in June that if Trump were to win the presidency and implement his economic plans, it could stoke inflation.\n\n\"Many Americans are concerned about inflation, which has come down remarkably fast. There is rightly a worry that Donald Trump will reignite this inflation, with his fiscally irresponsible budgets,\" according to a letter signed by the economists, including Joseph Stiglitz, a Columbia University professor who won the Nobel prize for economics in 2001; and Yale professor Robert Shiller, who won the Nobel prize for economics in 2013.\n\nHowever, their letter did not mention that Trump's economic proposals could bring about a recession.\n\nBy Aimee Picchi\n\nFalse: Trump claims \"they had the highest inflation perhaps in the history of our country\"\n\nDetails: Under President Biden, year-over-year inflation peaked at 9.1% in June 2022. That was the highest monthly figure in about 40 years, but not the highest ever. The 1970s and early 1980s saw inflation rates between 12% and 14%, according to Federal Reserve data. Inflation has since cooled considerably. The figures for July 2024 show year-to-year inflation is about 2.9%.\n\nBy Laura Doan\n\nFalse: Trump claims Haitian immigrants are \"eating the dogs\" and pets in Springfield, Ohio\n\nTrump: \"In Springfield, they're eating the dogs \u2014 the people that came in \u2014 they're eating the cats. They're eating \u2014 they're eating the pets of the people that live there. And this is what's happening in our country, and it's a shame.\"\n\nDetails: Officials in Springfield, Ohio, say they have not received any credible reports of Haitian immigrants abducting and eating pets, despite viral claims on social media that have been amplified this week by Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance and others.\n\nA city spokesperson told CBS News there have been \"no credible reports or specific claims\" of pets being harmed by immigrants. Clark County Park District officials told CBS News there has been \"no evidence or reports\" of people eating pets or wildlife.\n\nBy Layla Ferris, Rhona Tarrant\n\nInconclusive: Harris claims Trump \"will sign a national abortion ban\"\n\nHarris: \"If Donald Trump were to be reelected, he will sign a national abortion ban.\"\n\nDetails: While Trump has not flat-out endorsed a national abortion ban, he floated the idea of a 15- or 16-week national ban in March when he still had competitors in the Republican primary, suggesting it was something under discussion that he would support.\n\nHowever, Trump has also repeatedly said that the issue belongs with the states, and when he was asked directly about a ban in an Aug. 22 interview with \"Fox and Friends,\" he replied, \"I would never. There will not be a federal ban. This is now back in the states where it belongs.\"\n\nDuring his first term, Trump endorsed House legislation banning abortion nationwide after 20 weeks.\n\nBy Libby Cathey\n\nFalse: Trump claims Walz says \"execution after birth\" of babies \"is okay.\"\n\nTrump: \"[H]er vice presidential pick says abortion in the ninth month is absolutely fine. He also says execution after birth \u2014 it's execution, no longer abortion because the baby is born, \u2014 is OK. And that's not OK with me. Hence the vote.\"\n\nDetails: Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, has not said that execution of an infant after birth is \"okay.\"\n\nIn 2023, Walz signed into law a bill that included an update to Minnesota state law regarding medical care for infants born alive as a result of an abortion, according to the Minnesota Star Tribune. The updated state statute requires that \"all reasonable measures consistent with good medical practice\u2026shall be taken by the responsible medical personnel to care for the infant who is born alive,\" according to the Star Tribune. The law says that an infant born alive is fully recognized as a human person and \"accorded immediate protection under the law.\"\n\nIt is not legal in any state to execute an infant after birth.\n\nBy Steve Reilly\n\nMisleading: Trump claims Harris would end fracking in Pennsylvania \"on Day One\"\n\nTrump: \"If she won the election, fracking in Pennsylvania will end on Day One.\"\n\nDetails: As California attorney general, Harris filed a lawsuit challenging a federal assessment and approval for fracking off the coast of California. She also said \"there's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking,\" when asked during a 2019 town hall if she would commit to implementing a federal ban.\n\nHowever, as a presidential candidate in 2024, Harris has said her administration would not ban fracking. \"As vice president, I did not ban fracking. As president, I will not ban fracking,\" Harris said in a recent interview with CNN.\n\nWhen asked why she changed her mind on the issue, Harris said, \"What I have seen is that we can \u2014 we can grow, and we can increase a thriving clean energy economy without banning fracking.\"\n\nBy Emma Li and Laura Doan\n\nFalse: Trump claims Harris is busing in and paying people to attend her rallies\n\nTrump: \"People don't go to her rallies, there's no reason to go. And the people that do go, she's busing them in and paying them to be there and then showing them in a different light.\"\n\nDetails: An August 2024 Facebook post was circulated on the social media websites Truth Social by Trump and X by Kevin Sorbo. The post depicts a supposed Craigslist ad asking for paid actors to carry signs with \"Anti-Trump\" messages.\n\nThe post is a doctored image of another fabricated 2019 post of a Craigslist ad showing to ask for paid actors carrying \"Pro Trump\" signs at a rally in Phoenix.\n\nBy Jui Sarwate\n\nMisleading: Trump claims he has \"nothing to do with Project 2025\"\n\nTrump: \"I have nothing to do \u2014 as you know and as she knows better than anyone \u2014 I have nothing to do with Project 2025. That's out there, I haven't read it. I don't want to read it purposefully. I'm not going to read it.\"\n\nDetails: Trump has tried to put distance between himself and the controversial Project 2025, a multi-pronged initiative overseen by the conservative Heritage Foundation that includes a detailed blueprint for the next Republican president to usher in a sweeping overhaul of the executive branch.\n\nDemocrats have seized on Project 2025 and sought to tie the transition project to Trump, warning that its policy proposals are what Americans can expect if they elect him in November.\n\nRhetoric aside, a key data point from the policy perspective is apparent. Former Trump administration officials have contributed to Project 2025, and CBS News identified at least 270 proposals in the published blueprint that match Trump's past policies and campaign promises as he runs again for the White House.\n\nBy Hunter Woodall and Laura Doan\n\nMisleading: Harris claims \"we have created over 800,000 new manufacturing jobs while I have been vice president.\"\n\nDetails: August data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that since President Biden took office in January 2021, the U.S added around 739,000 manufacturing jobs.\n\nOn Aug. 21, the Labor Department issued a preliminary revision of its data that estimated that the number of manufacturing jobs created over the 12 months ending in March was likely 115,000 lower than the original estimate. The final calculation should be issued in early 2025. If that revision holds up, it would put the total number of manufacturing jobs created during the Biden-Harris administration closer to 624,000.\n\nIt is also worth noting that many of these gains followed heavy job losses in 2020 at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of manufacturing jobs in the U.S. has largely been growing since 2010, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, with the exception of 2020.\n\nBy Laura Doan and Julia Ingram\n\nTrue: Trump \"got more votes than any sitting president.\" But challenger Joe Biden won more.\n\nTrump: \"I got more votes than any Republican in history, by far. In fact, I got more votes than any president- sitting president, in history, by far.\"\n\nDetails: Trump received 74,223,975 popular votes in the 2020 presidential election, according to official election results published by the Federal Election Commission, the highest number of votes for a Republican candidate \u2014 or a sitting president, records show.\n\nBut Mr. Biden received 81,283,501 votes, the most ever cast for a U.S. presidential candidate \u2014 and over 7 million more than Trump.\n\nIn the Electoral College, Mr. Biden won the 2020 presidential election with 306 electoral votes to Trump's 232, a result that was certified by Congress.\n\nIn 2016, Trump won the Electoral College with 304 votes to Hillary Clinton's 227, but he lost the popular vote by nearly 2.9 million votes, winning 62,979,879, while Clinton won 65,844,954.\n\nBy Laura Doan\n\nFalse: Trump claims \"crime in this country is through the roof\"\n\nTrump: \"They've destroyed the fabric of our country. Millions of people let in. And all over the world, crime is down, all over the world, except here. Crime here is up and through the roof, despite their fraudulent statements that they made. Crime in this country is through the roof. And we have a new form of crime, it's called migrant crime. And it's happening at levels that nobody thought possible.\"\n\nDetails: FBI data from law enforcement agencies nationwide, including cities with crime increases during the Trump presidency, show rates of violent crime offenses \u2014 homicide, rape, robbery and aggravated assault \u2014decreased annually in the first two years of the Biden administration.\n\nThe crime drop has occurred in cities large and small, according to the FBI's preliminary data for 2023, with the largest drop occurring among those with populations of 1 million or more, many of which have received immigrants who entered the country during the Biden administration.\n\nBy Matt Clark\n\nand contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Presidential Candidate Questionnaire\nKamala Harris (D)\n\nVice President Harris and Governor Walz believe a healthy, vibrant rural America is essential to our nation\u2019s success.\n\n\n\nVice President Harris has addressed rural health care, mental health, the opioid epidemic, and more. Vice President Harris will make affordable health care a right, not a privilege by expanding and strengthening the Affordable Care Act and making permanent the Biden-Harris tax credit enhancements that are lowering health care premiums by an average of about $800 a year for millions of Americans. She\u2019ll build on the Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s successes in bringing down the cost of lifesaving prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries by extending the $35 cap on insulin and $2,000 cap on out-of-pocket spending for seniors to all Americans. Her tie-breaking vote on the Inflation Reduction Act gave Medicare the power to go toe to toe with Big Pharma and negotiate lower drug prices. As President, she\u2019ll accelerate the negotiations to cover more drugs and lower prices for Americans. As Vice President, she also announced that medical debt will be removed from credit reports, and helped cancel $7 billion of medical debt for 3 million Americans. As President, she\u2019ll work with states to cancel medical debt for even more Americans.\n\n\n\nVice President Harris has also worked to expand access to health care in rural America, dedicating $100 million to grow the workforce of registered nurses and nurse practitioners, especially for rural communities, and expanded support for rural hospitals with $500 million in Emergency Rural Health Care Grants. She has taken action to address our nation\u2019s mental health crisis by ensuring mental health coverage will be covered at the same level as other health care for Americans, securing record funding to hire and train over 14,000 mental health professionals for our schools, and expanding access to mental health services with $10 million in dedicated funding for rural areas. She has also helped provide a $50 million initiative to support opioid treatment and recovery services in rural communities.\n\n\n\nVice President Harris and Governor Walz are committed to creating economic opportunity in rural America.

        "text": "Stocks to watch if Trump wins the US election\nDefence industry outlook\n\nThe defence industry could see significant changes depending on the outcome of the 2024 US presidential election. Companies like Lockheed Martin and Raytheon Technologies may benefit if Donald Trump is re-elected. This is primarily due to the expectation of strong defence spending under a Trump administration.\n\nTrump's previous term saw increased military budgets and a focus on modernising the US armed forces. If re-elected, he may continue this trend, potentially boosting defence contractors' revenues and stock prices. However, it's important to note that defence spending can be influenced by various factors, including geopolitical events and congressional budget negotiations.\n\nInvestors interested in the defence sector should carefully monitor campaign promises and policy proposals from all candidates. It's also crucial to consider the long-term nature of defence contracts, which can span multiple administrations, potentially mitigating some election-related volatility.\n\nFor those considering investing in this sector, it's worth exploring shares of defence companies or related exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to gain exposure to the industry.\n\nOil and gas sector prospects\n\nThe oil and gas sector could see significant impacts from the 2024 election results. Companies like Exxon Mobil and Chevron may benefit if Trump secures a second term, given his historically pro-oil and pro-gas policies.\n\nDuring his previous administration, Trump rolled back numerous environmental regulations and promoted domestic energy production. A return to these policies could potentially boost profitability for oil and gas companies. This could lead to increased drilling activity, higher production volumes, and potentially, higher stock prices for companies in this sector.\n\nHowever, it's important to consider the broader context of the global energy market. Factors such as international oil prices, renewable energy trends, and climate change policies can all influence the performance of oil and gas stocks, regardless of who occupies the White House.\n\nInvestors interested in this sector might consider commodities trading or investing in energy sector funds. It's crucial to conduct thorough research and consider the long-term implications of energy policies and market trends.\n\nInfrastructure sector opportunities\n\nThe infrastructure sector could see significant growth if Trump wins and follows through on his promises of increased infrastructure investment. Companies like Caterpillar Inc. and Vulcan Materials Company might benefit from such initiatives.\n\nInfrastructure spending has been a key talking point in recent elections, with both major parties recognising the need for improvements to roads, bridges, and other public works. However, the scale and focus of such investments can vary greatly depending on the administration.\n\nIf substantial infrastructure bills are passed, it could lead to increased demand for construction equipment, materials, and services. This could potentially boost revenues and stock prices for companies in the sector.\n\nInvestors interested in this area might consider stocks of construction companies, materials suppliers, or infrastructure-focused funds. As always, it's important to diversify investments and consider the long-term prospects of the sector beyond short-term political developments.\n\nTrump-related stocks\n\nOne company that could see significant movement based on the election outcome is Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. This company, closely associated with the former president, could potentially see substantial growth if Trump wins re-election.\n\nThe reasoning behind this potential growth is multifaceted. A Trump victory could lead to increased attention and investment in his associated businesses. Additionally, his return to the presidency might be seen as validation of his business acumen, potentially boosting investor confidence in Trump-related enterprises.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to approach such investments with caution. Political connections can be a double-edged sword, potentially leading to increased scrutiny or regulatory challenges. Additionally, the performance of any company should be evaluated based on its financial fundamentals and growth prospects, not just its political associations.\n\nInvestors considering this or similar politically-linked stocks should conduct thorough research and consider the potential risks as well as rewards. It may be prudent to use tools like a demo account to practice trading strategies before committing real capital.\n\nAdditional stocks to watch\n\nBeyond the sectors already mentioned, there are other individual stocks that analysts believe could benefit from a Trump victory. Two companies frequently mentioned are Blackstone and Airbnb.\n\nThe rationale behind these predictions varies. For Blackstone, a major private equity firm, the expectation is that a Trump presidency might lead to more business deals and long-term investments. This could potentially increase Blackstone's deal flow and profitability.\n\nAirbnb, on the other hand, might benefit from increased travel, which some analysts predict could occur under a second Trump term. Additionally, both companies are noted for their current profitability, high margins, and operational efficiency, which could position them well regardless of the election outcome.\n\nIt's important to note that these are speculative predictions and that many factors beyond the presidential election can influence a company's stock performance. Investors should always conduct their own research and consider their risk tolerance before making investment decisions.\n\nThose interested in these or similar stocks might want to explore online trading options to access a wide range of markets.\n\nBroader economic considerations\n\nWhile individual stocks and sectors may see specific impacts, it's also important to consider the broader economic effects that could result from the election outcome. Some analysts predict that a Trump victory could lead to several macroeconomic changes.\n\nOne potential effect is increased travel, which could benefit not just companies like Airbnb, but also airlines, hotels, and other businesses in the tourism sector. Another prediction is an increase in business deals and long-term investments, which could have wide-ranging impacts across various industries.\n\nSome economists also suggest that a Trump presidency might lead to a stronger US dollar. This could increase purchasing power for both individuals and companies, potentially boosting consumer spending and corporate profits. However, a strong dollar can also have downsides, such as making US exports more expensive on the global market.\n\nIt's crucial to remember that economic predictions are inherently uncertain, and many factors beyond the presidency influence economic outcomes. Investors should consider a wide range of economic indicators and global trends when making investment decisions.\n\nFor those looking to navigate these potential economic shifts, learning about forex trading could be beneficial, as currency markets often reflect broader economic trends.",

Harris goads Trump into flustered performance\nDonald Trump and Kamala Harris met for the first time on the presidential debate stage in Philadelphia on Tuesday night.\n\nThey may have shaken hands, but they did not hit it off.\n\nIn a fiery 90 minutes, Harris frequently rattled the former president with personal attacks that threw him off message and raised the temperature of this highly-anticipated contest.\n\nHer pointed digs on the size of his rally crowds, his conduct during the Capitol riot, and on the officials who served in his administration who have since become outspoken critics of his campaign repeatedly left Trump on the back foot.\n\nThe pattern for much of this debate was Harris goading her Republican rival into making extended defences of his past conduct and comments. He gladly obliged, raising his voice at times and shaking his head.\n\nAmericans should go to a Trump rally, Harris said during an early question about immigration, because they were illuminating. \u201cPeople start leaving the rallies early out of exhaustion and boredom,\u201d she said.\n\nThat barb clearly rattled the former president, as he then spent most of his answer \u2013 on a topic that should have been one of his main areas of strength \u2013 defending his rally sizes and belittling hers.\n\nTrump went from there to an extended riff on a debunked report that Haitian immigrants in the town of Springfield, Ohio, were abducting and eating their neighbours\u2019 pets.",

It is not good. You must vote,\" he said.\n\n\"You must choose the lesser evil. Who is the lesser evil? That lady, or that gentleman? I don't know. Everyone, in conscience, (has to) think and do this.\"\n\nThe Pope has frequently criticised abortion, which is forbidden by Catholic teaching, in sharp terms.\n\n\"Forcing a child from the mother's womb is an assassination because there is life there,\" Francis said.\n\nAnd this is not his first time making critical comments about Trump.\n\nDuring the 2016 election, he described Trump as \"not Christian\" because of the presidential contender's anti-immigrant language.\n\n\"Expelling migrants, not letting them develop, not letting them have a life is an ugly thing, it's mean,\" he said on Friday.\n\nTrump has repeatedly promised to crack down on illegal immigration and as recently as Friday afternoon said he would deport millions of immigrants if re-elected.\n\nHarris has promised to expand nationwide protections for access to abortion after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.\n\nPope Francis's remarks come days after Trump and Harris debated one another for the first time. The pair was expected to take the debate stage one more time before election day, but Trump has said he would not debate Harris again.",

        "text": "Pope Francis says U.S. election a choice between \u2018the lesser evil\u2019 during in-flight press conference\nAboard the papal plane, Sep 13, 2024 / 13:50 pm\n\nPope Francis said that American voters face the choice between \u201cthe lesser evil\u201d in the U.S. presidential election during an in-flight press conference Friday on his return from his nearly two-week tour of Southeast Asia.\n\nSpeaking aboard the papal plane, a chartered Singapore Airlines flight, on Sept. 13, the pope encouraged Catholics to vote with their conscience.\n\n\u201cIn political morality, in general they say that if you don\u2019t vote, it\u2019s not good, it\u2019s bad. You have to vote, and you have to choose the lesser evil,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhat is the lesser evil? That woman, or that man?\u201d he continued, referring to Vice President Kamala Harris and her Republican opponent, former president Donald Trump. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Each one, in his or her conscience, must think and do this.\u201d\n\nIn the first press conference that Pope Francis has had to face in nearly a year, the pope expressed his satisfaction with the Vatican\u2019s controversial diplomatic accord with communist China, and he firmly ruled out the possibility of attending the reopening of Notre Dame cathedral in Paris. The pope was asked no questions about the alleged abuses and artwork of Father Marko Rupnik and he again underlined that abortion is \u201cmurder.\u201d\n\nCBS News reporter Anna Matranga asked Francis what advice he would give to an American voter who has to decide between a candidate \u201cwho is in favor of abortion and another who wants to deport millions of migrants.\u201d\n\nTrending 1 2 3 4 5\n\nPope Francis replied: \u201cBoth are anti-life \u2014 both the one who throws out migrants and the one who kills babies \u2014 both of them are against life.\u201d\n\nHarris, a Democrat who has made abortion without legal restrictions the centerpiece of her presidential campaign, and Trump, who has called for the deportations of perhaps millions of immigrants who have entered the U.S. illegally in recent years, are locked in a tight contest with just 52 days to go before the Nov. 5 election.\n\nThe Holy Father\u2019s remarks about \u201cthe lesser evil\u201d refers to the Church\u2019s long-standing teaching that when faced with a choice between candidates who aren\u2019t wholly aligned with the Church\u2019s position on fundamental \u201cnonnegotiable\u201d issues \u2014 such as the sanctity of life, marriage, and religious freedom \u2014 it is permissible to cast a vote against the candidate who would do the most harm.\n\nAbortion is \u2018murder\u2019\n\nThe pope went on to say that the science supports that life begins at conception, adding that although people may not like to use the word \u201ckill\u201d when discussing the topic, abortion is \u201cmurder.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo have an abortion is to kill a human being,\u201d Francis said.\n\n\u201cThe Church does not allow abortion because it is to kill, it is murder,\u201d he added. \u201cIt is murder. And this we have to be clear about.\u201d\n\nIn their updated voters guide, the U.S. bishops state: \u201cThe threat of abortion remains our preeminent priority because it directly attacks our most vulnerable and voiceless brothers and sisters and destroys more than a million lives per year in our country alone.\u201d\n\nPope Francis also spoke strongly about the topic of immigration, recalling his visit to Mexico\u2019s border with the United States where he offered Mass near the Diocese of El Paso, saying that \u201cto send migrants away\u201d or to not give them welcome is \u201csinful.\u201d\n\n\u201cSending migrants away, not letting them develop, not letting them have life, is a bad and nasty thing. Sending a baby away from its mother\u2019s breast is a murder because there is life. On these things, we must speak plainly,\u201d he said.\n\n(Story continues below)\n\nThe pope\u2019s comments come three days after the first presidential debate between Trump and Harris in which both abortion and migration were significant topics of debate. The U.S. debate occurred as Pope Francis was nearly 10,000 miles away visiting the island nations of East Timor, Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, and Singapore Sept. 2\u201313.\n\nDuring the 45-minute in-flight press conference \u2014 which was briefly interrupted by strong turbulence on the papal plane \u2014 Pope Francis also responded to questions about clerical sex abuse, Vatican-China dialogue, the war in Gaza, the death penalty, and his upcoming travel plans.\n\nAbuse is \u2018something demonic\u2019\n\nWhile Pope Francis was not asked about Rupnik during the in-flight press conference, the pope did speak at length about clerical sex abuse in response to a question from a French journalist about another recent clerical abuse scandal \u2014 that of Abb\u00e9 Pierre, a Catholic priest and Capuchin friar who died in 2007 and was one of the Church of France\u2019s most beloved and iconic figures.\n\nPope Francis speaks to journalists aboard the papal plane during an in-flight press conference on Friday, Sept. 13, 2024, on his return from his nearly two-week tour of Southeast Asia. Credit: Daniel Iba\u00f1ez/CNA\n\nThe late founder of the Emmaus Movement in France has been accused of sexual abuse and misconduct by at least seven victims \u2014 including one who was a minor at the time of her alleged assault. Like East Timor\u2019s Bishop Carlos Ximenes Belo, the island country\u2019s independence hero and Nobel Peace prize winner who has been sanctioned by the Vatican for sexually abusing young boys, Abb\u00e9 Pierre was looked up to in his country. Pierre was part of the French Resistance in World War II and is remembered for helping Jews cross the French border into Switzerland.\n\nSimon Leplatre, a journalist from Le Monde, asked Pope Francis what he would say \u201cto the general population who find it hard to believe that a person who did so much [many] good deeds could also commit crimes,\u201d referencing both Belo and Abb\u00e9 Pierre.\n\nIn his reply, the pope said that the question \u201ctouched a very painful and very delicate point,\u201d adding that public sins are to be condemned, including \u201call kinds of abuse.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbuse is, in my judgment, something demonic,\u201d Pope Francis said. \u201cBecause every type of abuse destroys the dignity of the person. Every type of abuse seeks to destroy that which all of us are, the image of God.\u201d\n\nDuring the pope\u2019s response, the papal plane was hit by strong turbulence, causing the captain of the aircraft to interrupt the press conference with a safety announcement.\n\n\u201cYour question caused turbulence!\u201d Pope Francis remarked. \u201cTo conclude, the sexual abuse of children, of minors, is a crime. It is a shame.\u201d\n\nJournalists who did not get the opportunity to ask a question during the in-flight press conference told CNA that they would have liked to confront the pope about Rupnik and other Catholics in positions of influence who have been accused of serious sexual offenses, including Luis Fernando Figari, the founder of the Sodalitium Vitae Christianae.\n\nThe pope responded to questions from 10 journalists \u2014 representing the countries visited and the different languages spoken in the press corps: Italian, Spanish, French, German, and English. Each language representative could only ask one question, and the English-speaking journalist chose to ask about the U.S. presidential election. In addition, a journalist from a Chinese-owned news outlet was allowed to ask the pope about the Holy See\u2019s dialogue with the Chinese government.\n\nVatican-China dialogue\n\nIn response to the question of whether the pope was satisfied with the results of the Holy See\u2019s provisional agreement with Beijing so far, Pope Francis said that in his view the results are good and there is goodwill in working on the appointment of bishops.\n\n\u201cI am happy with the dialogue with China,\u201d Francis said. \u201cI have heard how things are going from the secretary of state, and I am happy.\u201d\n\nPope Francis expressed his admiration for China\u2019s long history and reaffirmed his strong desire to visit the country.\n\n\u201cChina is a promise and a hope for the Church,\u201d the pope said.\n\nThe pope\u2019s comments on China come as the Vatican-China deal, first signed in 2018, is up for another two-year renewal at the end of this month.\n\nThe Vatican\u2019s dialogue with China has not always been smooth. The Vatican has admitted that China violated the terms of its provisional agreement on the consensual appointment of Catholic bishops in China via a joint China-Vatican commission by unilaterally appointing Catholic bishops in Shanghai and the \u201cdiocese of Jiangxi,\u201d a large diocese created by the Chinese government that is not recognized by the Vatican.\n\nHuman rights advocates have raised concerns over the Vatican\u2019s silence during the years of dialogue on the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s religious freedom violations, including the internment of Uyghur Muslims, and the imprisonment of democracy advocates, including Catholic Jimmy Lai, in Hong Kong.\n\nLast month, the Chinese government officially recognized a formerly \u201cunderground\u201d bishop in China, 95-year-old Bishop Melchior Shi Hongzhen, something the Vatican called \u201ca positive fruit of the dialogue\u201d with Beijing.\n\n\u2018Every day I call Gaza\u2019\n\nThe press conference during the pope\u2019s 12-hour return flight to Rome was the first papal press conference since the start of the war in Gaza nearly one year ago. Responding to a question about the recent Israeli strike on a Gaza school that killed 18 people, including two staff members of the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, the pope offered an assurance that \u201cthe Holy See is working.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery day I call Gaza, the parish in Gaza,\u201d Pope Francis revealed. \u201cIn the parish in the college there are 600 people, Christians and Muslims. They live as brothers. They tell me bad things, difficult things.\u201d\n\nLamenting the \u201cbodies of killed children\u201d in Gaza, the pope repeated his oft-repeated phrase that \u201cwar is always a defeat\u201d even for the winner. The pope added that he was grateful for the King of Jordan Abdullah II bin Al-Hussein, lauding him for \u201ctrying to make peace.\u201d\n\nDesire to visit Canary Islands\n\nPope Francis, who will turn 88 in December and frequently uses a wheelchair, appeared energetic and smiled often as he responded to journalists\u2019 questions aboard the plane. On the final day of the longest and one of the most arduous international trips of his pontificate, the 87-year-old pope was already ready to discuss future travels.\n\nPope Francis revealed that he is thinking of visiting the Canary Islands, an autonomous Spanish archipelago off the coast of northwestern Africa, especially because of its migrant population. The pope was asked to visit the Canary Islands by the Canary Islands\u2019 President Fernando Clavijo in an audience at the Vatican in January.\n\nPope Francis speaks to journalists aboard the papal plane during an in-flight press conference on Friday, Sept. 13, 2024, on his return from his nearly two-week tour of Southeast Asia. Credit: Daniel Iba\u00f1ez/CNA\n\nThe pope definitively ruled out the possibility of visiting France for the reopening of the Notre Dame cathedral on Dec. 8. The cathedral is set to reopen on the solemnity of the Immaculate Conception, a feast that the pope traditionally always celebrates with the city of Rome in the piazza at the foot of the Spanish Steps.\n\nPope Francis was less decisive about the possibility of a long-awaited trip to his native Argentina. He told Argentine journalist Elisabetta Pique that he would like to go to Argentina but \u201cit is still not decided\u201d because \u201cthere are a number of things to resolve first.\u201d\n\nLongest journey of his pontificate\n\nAmid much skepticism as to how the elderly pope would be able to handle the ambitious international trip, Pope Francis completed his longest journey yet, flying a staggering 20,000 miles in total on seven flights to visit four countries in Southeast Asia and Oceania.\n\nOn his final return flight to Rome, the pope slowly made his way down the aisle of the aircraft using a walking cane before being assisted to sit down on a small folding chair from which he thanked the journalists for accompanying him on the long journey.\n\nPope Francis said that he was impressed by the art and the traditional dances he encountered in Papua New Guinea and the skyscrapers and apparent lack of discrimination in the multicultural city-state of Singapore. The pope added that Singapore will soon host the Formula One Singapore Grand Prix, which he said is a testament to how the city is an international destination that attracts different cultures.\n\nAs he spoke about his journey, it was clear that East Timor, a small, impoverished country established in 2002, made a strong impression on the pope. An estimated 600,000 people turned out for the papal Mass in East Timor \u2014 nearly half of the population of the island country that is 98% Catholic.\n\nPope Francis praised East Timor\u2019s \u201cculture of life,\u201d commending the country\u2019s high birth rate and adding that wealthier countries, including Singapore, could learn from the small country that \u201cchildren are the future.\u201d\n\n\u201cEast Timor is a simple culture, very family-based, happy, a culture of life with many children,\u201d he said. The pope underlined that he hopes this aspect of Timorese culture can be protected from \u201cideas that come from outside,\u201d which can be like the saltwater crocodiles that have overrun some of the young country\u2019s pristine coral-reef beaches.\n\n\u201cLet me tell you one thing,\u201d Pope Francis added. \u201cI fell in love with East Timor.\u201d",

        "text": "Election 2024: Did the Harris-Trump Debate Reset the Presidential Race?\nKamala Harris and Donald Trump held their much-anticipated presidential debate in Philadelphia on Tuesday night. An estimated 67.1 million people tuned in to watch, an audience nearly a third larger than the one that watched Trump square off against Joe Biden back in June. By most accounts\u2014though not Trump\u2019s\u2014Harris emerged the victor.\n\nPerhaps most important for Harris, she looks to have passed the commander-in-chief test. Going into the debate, Trump had argued that the world leaders would treat her \u201clike a play toy.\u201d After Harris repeatedly lit into Trump at the debate and had him on the defensive, that narrative looks far harder to sustain.\n\nDoes Harris\u2019s success mean that the fundamental dynamics of the race have changed? Probably not. Yes, some debates change everything. Just ask President Biden. But despite the hullabaloo that builds up every four years about presidential debates, they seldom move the political needle much or in a lasting fashion. Hillary Clinton was judged to have won her debates against Trump in 2016. She saw a bump in her poll numbers. Her lead didn\u2019t last.\n\nThe Water's Edge James M.

The world\u2019s biggest star also shared a link to vote.gov showing how to register to vote. More than 400,000 people visited the site in the following twenty-four hours. That\u2019s more than thirteen times the traffic the site receives in a typical day. Celebrity endorsements can matter. But visiting a website is a far cry from registering to vote, let alone voting in a battleground state that could change the outcome of the election.\n\nOne reason debates generally don\u2019t make a difference is that most viewers already know who they support. They are tuning in to root for their favored candidate rather than to be persuaded to switch sides. A bad performance is just something to shrug off. Biden voters didn\u2019t join the Trump cause in late June because their man faltered in the spotlight.\n\nAt the same time, debates don\u2019t freeze campaigns in amber. While the Harris team is looking to amplify the conclusion that she won, the Trump team is working to persuade wavering and undecided voters to rethink what they saw and heard. That\u2019s why Trump and his supporters are leaning hard into the claim that he was disadvantaged because he had to square off against not one opponent in the debate but three. Beyond that, events and miscues by either candidate could have voters quickly forgetting what the candidates said in Philadelphia.\n\nOn that score, the big question following Tuesday night\u2019s debate was whether there would be a sequel. The Harris campaign challenged Trump to a rematch even as stagehands were still striking the set in Philadelphia. While Trump had said he would debate Biden \u201cany time, any place,\u201d his response to reporters in the media scrum after Tuesday night\u2019s debate was: \u201cWe\u2019ll look at it, but they want a second debate because they lost.\u201d On Wednesday morning, he said he was \u201cnot inclined to do\u201d another debate unless it was on Fox News with Sean Hannity, Jesse Watters, and Laura Ingraham as the moderators. Yesterday afternoon, he took to Truth Social to declare: \u201cTHERE WILL BE NO THIRD DEBATE!\u201d\n\nThat may or may not settle things. Last night, Harris ignored Trump\u2019s declaration and said \u201cwe owe it to the voters to have another debate.\u201d Expect the Harris campaign to needle Trump about his sudden aversion to debates in a bid to goad him into changing his mind, something he has done more than once in his career. Even if Trump stands firm, the Harris team will see the attacks as a way to dent his persona of strength.\n\nWhile those atmospherics play out, both campaigns will be honing their messages and working on turning out the vote in battleground states. Harris and Trump both know that the race remains a toss-up with early voting about to begin in many states and with Election Day just over seven weeks away. Any mistakes from here on out will be hard to overcome. Don\u2019t expect either campaign to give an inch. Do expect the campaigning\u2014by the campaigns and by aligned groups\u2014to become even more hard-edged. Politics, as the saying goes, ain\u2019t beanbag.\n\nCampaign Update\n\nMichael McCaul, the Republican chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, released a report on Sunday calling the botched U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan \u201cwillful blindness.\u201d With Election Day less than two months away, the report went out of its way to criticize Harris. As Politico noted, an interim report that McCaul released in 2022 mentioned Harris just twice. The new report mentions her more than 250 times.\n\nPerhaps not coincidentally, on Monday, nine retired flag officers and a retired master sergeant of the U.S. Marine Corps released a letter saying that \u201cHarris is the best\u2014and only\u2014presidential candidate in this race who is fit to serve as our commander-in-chief.\u201d The group added that Trump\u2019s failed deal-making in Afghanistan \u201cseverely hindered the Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s ability to execute the most orderly withdrawal possible and put our service members and our allies at risk.\u201d\n\nLast Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin trolled the Harris campaign by telling a group in Vladivostok that he was supporting Harris for president, saying: \u201cShe laughs so expressively and infectiously that it means that she is doing well.\u201d He added that Trump placed \u201cso many restrictions and sanctions against Russia like no other president has ever introduced before him.\u201d The giveaway that Putin wasn\u2019t serious was his claim that \u201cour \u2018favorite,\u2019 if you can call it that, was the current president, Mr. [Joe] Biden.\u201d Sure.\n\nThe judge in the Georgia election interference case threw out two more charges against Trump. However, the judge declined a request from Trump\u2019s lawyers to throw out all the charges. The original indictment charged Trump with thirteen criminal violations; he now faces eight charges. The trial itself is unlikely to take place if Trump wins in November.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy, Jr. got good news last Friday. Appeals courts in Michigan and North Carolina ruled that his name should be removed from their state\u2019s election ballots. One consequence of the ruling is that North Carolina did not send out mail-in ballots on Friday, as planned. North Carolina\u2019s Supreme Court on Monday in a 4-3 vote confirmed the decision to take Kennedy\u2019s name off the state ballot. The decision means that nearly three million freshly printed ballots will be thrown out. It will take the North Carolina Election Board a while to print ones. The state has 2,348 ballot styles because who is running in congressional and local races varies from town to town. With North Carolina\u2019s ballot on hold, Alabama became the first state in the nation to begin sending general election ballots to absentee voters. The ballots went out yesterday.\n\nSpeaking of ballot issues, a judge in Georgia disqualified third-party candidate Cornel West as a presidential candidate in the state on the grounds that he failed to file the proper paperwork. That ruling created a problem. West\u2019s name is already on the state\u2019s printed ballots, and it\u2019s too late to take his name off. The ballots are scheduled to be sent to military and overseas voters next week. Unless the Georgia Supreme Court overturns the decision, votes for West won\u2019t be counted. With the vote in Georgia expected to be close between Harris and Trump, Democrats worry that West could pick up votes that deny the vice president victory in the Peachtree State.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday designated the certification of the 2024 presidential vote at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2025, a \u201cspecial national security event.\u201d The designation, which typically applies to events like the Super Bowl, provides additional resources to create a security plan for the certification and to prevent a reoccurrence of the violence that Americans witnessed on January 6, 2021.\n\nWhat the Candidates Are Saying\n\nIf Tuesday night\u2019s debate likely didn\u2019t change the course of the race, it did showcase contrasting visions of where the United States is and where it needs to go. That was particularly the case with foreign policy. Lawfare summarized the conversation well. Trump laid out:\n\na vision in which the primary threat to America is migration across our southern border, in which foreign trade partners and allies alike are fleecing and taking advantage of America and weak American leaders are unable or unwilling to protect our interests, and in which we face the possibility of a nuclear war with Russia over the Biden administration\u2019s support for Ukraine.\n\nHarris offered a vision in which:\n\nthe southern border is a manageable problem, Trump himself\u2014not immigration\u2014presents the major threat to the rule of law, America needs to stand by our allies and benefits from its network of alliances around the world, and America\u2019s position in the world is menaced by Trump\u2019s own solicitude for dictators.\u201d\n\nVoters clearly face a choice and not an echo in November.\n\nLittle of what the two candidates said about foreign policy was new. Trump again touted tariffs as a cure-all for most of what ails the United States and again said, wrongly, that foreign countries and not Americans pay tariffs. The moment that was perhaps most alarming to U.S. allies in Europe\u2014and to many Americans as well\u2014was Trump\u2019s refusal to say whether he thought it was in the U.S. national interest for Ukraine to win its war against Russia. While avoiding the question, Trump did say, wrongly, that the United States has sent almost twice as much aid to Ukraine as all of Europe combined. The reality is that Europe has spent more on Ukraine than the United States has. Neither Harris nor the moderators corrected what Trump said about tariffs or aid to Ukraine.\n\nHarris was asked about the war in Gaza. She said, as she has many times before, that Israel has a right to defend itself, called for a ceasefire, and endorsed a two-state solution. She said nothing about how she would achieve either of those latter two ends. When asked in the final question about climate change, she touted the importance of building a clean energy economy but skipped over how she would make that happen. Harris did say that the Biden administration had \u201cincreased domestic gas production to historic levels.\u201d That is true, but it probably is not something that had climate activists cheering.\n\nThe Harris campaign on Sunday posted a policy page on its website. Organized under the title \u201cA New Way Forward,\u201d the page lists four categories of issues: \u201cBuild an Opportunity Economy and Lower Costs for Families,\u201d \u201cSafeguard Our Fundamental Freedoms,\u201d \u201cEnsure Safety and Justice for All,\u201d and \u201cKeep America Safe, Secure, and Prosperous.\u201d As with most candidates\u2019 policy pages, Harris\u2019s is long on promises and short on the steps to achieve them. For instance, when it comes to meeting the China challenge, the Harris campaign promises:\n\nShe will invest in the competitive advantages that make America the strongest nation on Earth\u2014American workers, innovation, and industry\u2014and will work to ensure America remains a leader in the industries of the future, from semiconductors to clean energy to artificial intelligence.\n\nHarris\u2019s policy pages also seek to \u201chelp\u201d undecided voters by providing a contrasting, and not flattering, summary of \u201cTrump\u2019s Project 2025 Agenda\u201d on each issue.\n\nTrump said at a rally in Wisconsin last Saturday that he would impose a 100 percent import tariff on countries that are looking to lessen or end their use of U.S. dollars to finance their international transactions. He didn\u2019t offer any specifics on which countries would qualify for the tariffs or what threshold of non-dollar transactions would trigger them. The goal of the proposal is to reinforce the dollar\u2019s role as the world\u2019s main reserve currency. Brazil, China, Russia, and other countries have discussed ways to \u201cde-dollarize\u201d the global economy because, among other things, the dollar\u2019s prominence gives Washington economic leverage against everyone else, as Moscow discovered with the financial sanctions levied in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine. As my colleague Brad Setser has pointed out, Trump\u2019s proposal, if it were enacted, would most likely backfire on the United States by making the dollar \u201cless attractive as a global currency over time.\u201d It would also fuel inflation in the United States.\n\nWhat the Pundits Are Saying\n\nPolitico\u2019s Nahal Toosi argued that Tuesday\u2019s debate showed the rest of the world that Harris is ready to be president. According to Toosi, \u201cby the time the debate was over, several foreign officials from both U.S. allies and more neutral countries told me they felt more confident that Harris could handle the tricky personalities she\u2019d encounter while in the world\u2019s most powerful job.\u201d\n\nForeign Policy\u2019s Matt Kroenig argued that the world should stop worrying about a second Trump term. According to Kroenig, \u201can evenhanded assessment of the record shows that Trump was an effective foreign-policy president, presiding over a period of relative global stability and prosperity, and a second Trump administration promises improved performance based on the lessons learned in the first term.\u201d Kroenig\u2019s equanimity is largely predicated on the fact that \u201cpersonnel is policy, and there are many accomplished candidates rumored to be in the running for top foreign-policy posts in a second Trump administration, including former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, former National Security Advisor Robert O\u2019Brien, Sen. Marco Rubio, Sen. Tom Cotton, former ambassador to Japan and current Sen. Bill Hagerty, former director of national intelligence and former Rep. John Ratcliffe, and others.\u201d Kroenig didn\u2019t address why so many of Trump\u2019s former national security officials, including his former vice president (Mike Pence), former secretary of defense (Mark Esper), former chief of staff (John Kelly), and former national security adviser (John Bolton) have attacked his fitness for office.\n\nMy colleague Charles Kupchan wrote in Foreign Affairs that Democrats should seek to understand rather than dismiss Trump\u2019s isolationism. It can be fairly debated whether Trump is an isolationist, assuming that term means anything more than a critic of liberal internationalism. But Charlie is certainly correct that Democrats need to recognize that \u201can expansive liberal internationalism\u2026is no longer sustainable at home or abroad.\u201d The historical irony, of course, is that \u201cthe historical bouts of strategic overreach, such as in Afghanistan and Iraq,\u201d that Charlie warns about were initiated by Republican and not Democratic presidents and ardently supported by many of the voters now flocking to Trump\u2019s banner.\n\nWhat the Polls Show\n\nThe Pew Research Center released a short report on important things to know about election polling. One lesson is that \u201ccompared with other elections in the past 20 years, polls have been less accurate when Donald Trump is on the ballot.\u201d Pew says so-called shy Trump voters who are unwilling to be honest with pollsters isn\u2019t the problem. The inaccuracy instead owes partly to the fact that Trump enjoys more support among voters who skip midterm elections. Because pollsters use behavior in midterm elections to determine who qualifies as \u201clikely voters,\u201d these missing voters skew the results. Another factor is that Trump voters may be less likely to participate in polls in the first place. If a group of voters is more likely to avoid talking to pollsters but still votes, then the poll will be less accurate.\n\nPew also released a detailed report on how Americans see Harris\u2019s and Trump\u2019s relative strengths and weaknesses. One finding is that a substantial gap exists between Harris and Trump supporters on what presidential actions are acceptable. Although majorities of both groups agree that presidents should use executive orders when they cannot get their policies through Congress, agreement stops there. Fifty-four percent of Trump supporters say it would be acceptable for a \u201cfuture President Trump to order federal law enforcement officials to investigate Democratic political opponents.\u201d Just 27 percent of Harris backers agree that it would be appropriate for a President Harris to do so. Likewise, 41 percent of Trump supporters see no problem with a future President Trump firing federal employees who are not personally loyal to him. Just 12 percent of Harris backers were comfortable with her acting likewise.\n\nThe Campaign Schedule\n\nThe first in-person absentee voting in the nation begins in Minnesota and South Dakota in one week (September 20, 2024).\n\nElection Day is fifty-three days away (November 5, 2024).\n\nElectors will meet in each state and the District of Columbia to cast their votes for president and vice president in ninety-one days (December 17, 2024).\n\nThe 119th U.S. Congress will be sworn into office in 112 days (January 3, 2025).\n\nThe U.S. Congress will certify the results of the 2024 presidential election in 115 days (January 6, 2025).\n\nInauguration Day is 129 days away (January 20, 2025).\n\nShelby Sires assisted in the preparation of this post.",

        "text": "Both US presidential candidates espouse anti-life views, pope says\nABOARD THE PAPAL FLIGHT FROM SINGAPORE (CNS) -- Asked what a U.S. Catholic given a choice between voting for a person who supports abortion or one who supports closing borders and deporting migrants, Pope Francis said one must choose \"the lesser evil.\"\n\n\"Who is the 'lesser evil' that woman or that man?\" the pope asked, referring to Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. \"I do not know. Each person must think and decide in his or her conscience.\"\n\nPope Francis spent 45 minutes answering questions from 10 journalists on his flight Sept. 13 from Singapore to Rome at the end of a 12-day trip. He was asked about the four countries he visited, about sexual abuse, about his future travel plans, about the war in the Holy Land and the Vatican's relations with China.\n\nPope Francis responds to a journalist's question during an in-flight new conference on his way back to Rome from Singapore Sept. 13, 2024. (CNS photo/Lola Gomez)\n\nA U.S. television reporter asked him about the choice Catholic voters face between Harris, who supports legalized abortion, and Trump, who wants to severely restrict immigration and has said he wants to deport tens of thousands of migrants.\n\nBoth attitudes \"are against life: the one who wants to throw out the migrants and the one who kills children,\" the pope said. \"Both are against life.\"\n\nIn the Old Testament, he said, God's people are repeatedly reminded to care for \"'widows, orphans and the stranger,' that is, the migrant. They are the three that the People of Israel must protect. The one who does not care for migrants is lacking; it is a sin.\"\n\nAnd \"to have an abortion is to kill a human being. Whether or not you like the word, it is killing,\" the pope said. \"The Catholic Church does not allow abortion because it is killing. It is assassination. And we must be clear about that.\"\n\nPope Francis was asked if there were situations when a Catholic could vote for a candidate who was in favor of abortion.\n\n\"In political morality, generally, they say not voting is wrong; one must vote, and one must choose the lesser evil\" in accordance with one's conscience, he said.\n\nAbortion and care for migrants are both issues the U.S. bishops urge Catholics to consider when voting. In their document, \"Forming Consciences for Faithful Citizenship,\" however, they say, \"The threat of abortion remains our pre-eminent priority because it directly attacks our most vulnerable and voiceless brothers and sisters and destroys more than a million lives per year in our country alone.\"\n\nAt the beginning of Pope Francis' trip, a French writer started a rumor that the pope would travel to Paris Dec. 8 for the reopening and consecration of the altar in Notre Dame Cathedral, rebuilt after a devastating fire in 2019.\n\nWhen asked about that trip, the pope's response was simple: \"I will not go to Paris.\"\n\nAs for the idea of the 87-year-old pope making a trip to Argentina, his homeland, he was not as clear.\n\n\"That is something that still hasn't been decided,\" he said. \"I would like to go. They are my people. But there are various things to resolve first.\"\n\nHowever, if he does go, he said, he would want to stop over in the Canary Islands, a Spanish autonomous region in the Atlantic, where thousands of migrants -- including many unaccompanied minors -- have arrived from Senegal, Mali and other African countries.\n\nRegarding the ongoing clerical sexual abuse scandal, Pope Francis was asked about new revelations in the case of Abb\u00e9 Pierre, the French priest and founder of the Emmaus Community, who died in 2007 at the age of 94.\n\nAs the pope's trip began, the Emmaus Community announced that new accusations of sexual abuse of women and children had been made against the priest, and French media reported that church officials and leaders of the community had tried to cover up allegations as far back as the 1950s.\n\n\"We must speak clearly on these things and not hide them,\" the pope said. \"Abuse, in my judgment, is something diabolical\" because it attacks the sacredness and God-given dignity of another person.\n\nPope Francis playfully wraps the microphone cable around his waist, pretending it is a seatbelt, as turbulence interrupts his in-flight press conference as he returns to Rome Sept. 13, 2024, after visiting Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Timor-Leste and Singapore. (CNS photo/Lola Gomez)\n\nAt that point in the Singapore Airlines flight, the pilot interrupted Pope Francis and announced over the loudspeaker that everyone should return to their seats and fasten their seatbelts.\n\n\"Your question created some turbulence,\" the pope quipped to the reporter.\n\nNevertheless, the pope remained on his portable chair in the center aisle and continued answering questions.\n\n\"The sexual abuse of children, of minors, is a crime,\" he said.\n\nAfter answering two other questions, Pope Francis returned to the topic of Abb\u00e9 Pierre to tell the reporter, \"I don't know when the Vatican came to know about it. I don't know because I wasn't here, and I never thought to research it, but certainly after his death -- that is certain.\"\n\nOn the Vatican's relationship with China, the pope said, \"I am content with the dialogue with China. The results are good. Also, on the nomination of bishops, the work is going forward with goodwill.\"\n\nIn 2018, the Vatican and the government of China signed an agreement outlining procedures for ensuring Catholic bishops are elected by the Catholic community in China and approved by the pope before their ordinations or installations. The provisional, two-year agreement, already renewed in 2020 and 2022, is up for renewal in October.\n\nThe text has never been made public, but the Vatican has complained a couple times in the past six years when China named or transferred bishops in apparent violation of the accord.\n\nThe pope also said he welcomed China's efforts to encourage a peaceful settlement of the fighting in the Gaza Strip.\n\n\"I call the parish in Gaza every day, every day,\" he said; inside the compound of Holy Family Parish, some 600 people -- Christians and Muslims -- have taken shelter.\n\nPope Francis said he could not judge whether Israel's reaction to the Hamas invasion in October is excessive, \"but, please, when you see the bodies of children who have been killed -- when you see that because of a presumption that there are some guerrillas there they bomb a school -- it's awful, awful.\"\n\n\"Sometimes,\" he said, \"a war is just too much, too much.\"",

        "text": "U.S. sanctions Maduro's allies after disputed Venezuela presidential election\nThe U.S. government on Thursday responded to Venezuela's disputed July presidential election by imposing sanctions against 16 allies of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, accusing them of obstructing the vote and carrying out human rights abuses.\n\nThose targeted by the Treasury Department include the head of the country's high court, leaders of state security forces and prosecutors. The move came days after the departure into exile of Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia, the former diplomat who represented the main opposition parties and claimed to have won the July 28 presidential election by a wide margin.\n\nVenezuela's electoral authorities declared Maduro the victor hours after polls closed, but unlike previous presidential elections, they never released detailed vote tallies to back up their claim arguing that the National Electoral Council's website was hacked. To the surprise of supporters and opponents, Gonz\u00e1lez and opposition leader Maria Corina Machado shortly afterward announced not only that their campaign had obtained vote tallies from over two-thirds of the electronic voting machines used in the election but also that they had published them online to show the world that Maduro had lost.\n\nGlobal condemnation over the lack of transparency prompted Maduro to ask Venezuela's high court, stacked with ruling party loyalists, to audit the results. The court reaffirmed his victory.\n\nExperts from the United Nations and the Carter Center, which observed the election at the invitation of Maduro's government, determined the results announced by electoral authorities lacked credibility. The U.N. experts stopped short of validating the opposition's claim to victory but said the faction's voting records published online appear to exhibit all of the original security features.\n\n\"Rather than respecting the will of the Venezuelan people as expressed at the ballot box, Maduro and his representatives have falsely claimed victory while repressing and intimidating the democratic opposition in an illegitimate attempt to cling to power by force,\" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement.\n\nThe State Department said it is placing new visa restrictions on Maduro allies who are accused of impeding the vote and repressing Venezuelans. The department did not name those individuals.\n\nThe potential effect of the individual sanctions and visa restrictions announced Thursday is unclear. Previously punished Maduro loyalists still play key roles in Venezuela's government, including as vice president, attorney general and defense minister.\n\nA senior Biden administration official told reporters that the U.S. expects the latest announcement to \"prompt deeper reflection\" among the Maduro allies about how far they will go to help him in his effort to stay in power. The official spoke on condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the administration.\n\nThe Treasury has penalized more than 140 current or former Venezuelan officials. The State Department has identified nearly 2,000 people as possibly facing visa restrictions over allegations of corruption, undermining democracy or violating Venezuelans' human rights.\n\nVenezuela's government released a statement that characterized the latest set of sanctions as a \"rude act that seeks to ingratiate itself with a political class that has resorted to fascist and violent practices to overthrow, without success,\" Maduro.\n\nA joint statement from more than 50 countries that was delivered Thursday at the United Nations by Panama's foreign minister, Javier Mart\u00ednez-Acha V\u00e1squez, called on Venezuela's National Electoral Council \"to immediately publish\" the tally sheets and \"allow for the impartial verification of results by independent observers to promote credibility, legitimacy, and a transparent electoral process.\"\n\nThe signatories, including the U.S., Spain, Chile and South Korea, also denounced the repression measures that Maduro's government has been accused of carrying out after the election, including arbitrary detentions, intimidation tactics and killings.\n\n\"We express deep concern with the politically motivated arrest warrant by Venezuelan authorities\" that was issued Sept. 3 for Gonz\u00e1lez and \"has forced him into exile,\" according to the statement.\n\nGonz\u00e1lez, in a statement posted on X, tried to reassure voters of his pledge to see a government transition in Venezuela.\n\n\"My commitment to the mandate I have received from the sovereign people of Venezuela is unwavering,\" he wrote. \"The battle that Maria Corina Machado and I have led remains unwavering.\"",

Simone Risoluti/Getty\n\nAsked whether there were any circumstances under which it would be morally permissible for a Catholic to vote for a candidate who does support abortion rights, Francis said when considering political morality, \"one must vote.\"\n\n\"One must choose the lesser of two evils,\" he said. \"Who is the lesser of two evils, that lady or that gentleman, I do not know.\"\n\nPope Francis said American Catholic voters would have to examine their conscience and make that decision before going to the polls.\n\n\"It should be clear that sending migrants away, denying migrants the capacity to work, to not welcome migrants, it is a sin. It is grave,\" the pope said.\n\nFrancis said immigration was a right that dates back to biblical times, and noted that it was repeated in the Old Testament of the Bible that the people of Israel had a duty \"to take care of the orphan, the widow and the stranger \u2014 that is, the migrant.\"\n\nFrancis also reiterated the Catholic Church's position that abortion is murder.\n\n\"Whether you like the word or not, it is a killing,\" he said. \"It is an assassination, and on this we should be clear.\"",

Generate Key Takeaways\n\nClaim:\n\nRussian leader Vladimir Putin endorsed Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in September 2024 in the buildup to the U.S. presidential election.\n\nRating:\n\nRating: True\n\nContext:\n\nAlthough the Russian president did say on Sept. 5, 2024, that he endorsed the Democratic candidate for president, few people believed his comments were serious. Many news outlets and political pundits concluded that he was joking.\n\nDuring the Sept. 10, 2024, presidential debate, former U.S. President Donald Trump claimed Vladimir Putin endorsed Kamala Harris in her bid to win the presidential election.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Putin endorsed her last week. Said I hope she wins. And I think he meant it,\" Trump told ABC's debate moderators Linsey Davis and David Muir. The Republican nominee made the comment at 1:02:18 while facing off against U.S. Vice President Harris.\n\nExamples of the claim then appeared on social media platforms, such as X, Facebook and YouTube.\n\nIn short, Trump was right to say Putin backed Harris earlier in September. The Russian president did offer his support to the Democratic candidate earlier that month. However, few people took his comments seriously.\n\nSpeaking at the Eastern Economic Forum in the Russian far-eastern city of Vladivostok on Sept. 5, Putin said he would \"lend\" Harris his support (archived):\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAs for my preferences [in the U.S. election], it is not up to us to decide. After all, the American people will have to make their own choice. As I have already said, we favoured Mr Biden, the current President, but they took him out of the race. That said, he advised his supporters to support Ms Harris. So, we will act accordingly and lend her our support.\n\nHe later added that the Democratic nominee has \"a very contagious\" laugh, whereas \"no other President has ever imposed so many restrictions and sanctions against Russia\" as Trump.\n\nVideo footage showed the Russian president had a raised eyebrow and a smirk on his face while making the remarks, leading numerous political pundits to conclude that his comments were not meant to be taken seriously.\n\nBritish news outlet Sky News' Moscow correspondent Ivor Bennett claimed Putin was \"mischief-making\" by endorsing Harris:\n\nSafe to say, Vladimir Putin is having a little chuckle himself here. His comments are almost certainly more mischief-making than a statement of fact because, as we know, Russia's president doesn't always say what he thinks.\n\nBennett said Putin may have hoped that by appearing to support the U.S. vice president it would actually harm her chances of winning the election. This, he wrote, would open the door for a second Trump term, which would mean \"a cut to US aid to Ukraine, which in turn would significantly boost Russia's prospects on the battlefield.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nNew York Times reporter Julian E. Barnes added that \"most observers believe\" the Russian leader's comments \"were said in jest,\" adding: \"The U.S. intelligence agencies have assessed that Putin supports the election of Trump.\"\n\nBennett also suggested Putin's support of the former president was because Moscow believed a Trump administration would \"cut back, or end, U.S. military aid to Ukraine.\"\n\nLikewise, both the Associated Press (AP) and Reuters said Putin was \"teasing\" by endorsing Harris, with the latter calling it an \"ironic remark.\" AP and Al Jazeera added that even the audience appeared to be in on the joke by laughing at his comments, while The Economic Times noted the moderator smiled at the endorsement. Bloomberg went as far to brand the support \"trolling\" (archived).\n\nTherefore, Trump was right to claim Putin said he backed Harris, however it was reasonable to doubt the sincerity of the endorsement.\n\nSources:\n\n- YouTube. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRh6598RmHM.

        "text": "Pope Francis urges Catholics to pick 'lesser evil' between Trump and Harris\nAmerican Catholics make up 52 million of the 1.4 billion Catholics globally.\n\nPope Francis was asked to counsel Catholic voters during the in-flight news conference and noted in his remarks that he was not an American and would not be voting in the election.\n\nBut he encouraged Americans to vote.\n\n\"Not voting is ugly. It is not good. You must vote,\" he said.\n\n\"You must choose the lesser evil. Who is the lesser evil? That lady, or that gentleman? I don't know. Everyone, in conscience, (has to) think and do this.\"\n\nThe Pope has frequently criticised abortion, which is forbidden by Catholic teaching, in sharp terms.\n\n\"Forcing a child from the mother's womb is an assassination because there is life there,\" Francis said.\n\nAnd this is not his first time making critical comments about Trump.\n\nDuring the 2016 election, he described Trump as \"not Christian\" because of the presidential contender's anti-immigrant language.\n\n\"Expelling migrants, not letting them develop, not letting them have a life is an ugly thing, it's mean,\" he said on Friday.\n\nTrump has repeatedly promised to crack down on illegal immigration and as recently as Friday afternoon said he would deport millions of immigrants if re-elected.\n\nHarris has promised to expand nationwide protections for access to abortion after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.\n\nPope Francis's remarks come days after Trump and Harris debated one another for the first time. The pair was expected to take the debate stage one more time before election day, but Trump has said he would not debate Harris again.",

        "text": "ElectionWatch 2024: 24 questions for the 2024 US elections\nHow do we expect the financial sector to perform based on the election results?\n\nWe expect that a Trump administration would be positive for the financial services industry while a Harris administration would likely be neutral to negative.\n\nIn our view, there are three main election risk factors for US financials, namely: legislative risk, regulatory risk, and headline risk. While there could be some targeted bills in areas like Government Sponsored Enterprise reform, we believe legislative risk remains modest given the wide-ranging scope of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act. It also seems likely that the currently high degree of headline risk will not change much\u2014especially under a divided Congress scenario. Accordingly, in our opinion, the main risk consideration based on the election results is regulatory risk as any new administration would likely nominate new heads of the various regulatory agencies that oversee the financial services sector. We believe a Trump administration would likely nominate regulatory heads who are less likely to interpret existing (or impose new) regulations that add to sector compliance and capital costs.\n\nPersonnel is policy. New regulatory heads at the Fed, FDIC, OCC, CFPB and other agencies could hold fewer negative views about the financial sector\u2019s role in the broader US economy. This could involve a lighter-touch supervisory regime and fewer regulatory orders and penalties. Accordingly, the overall regulatory burden including the cost of compliance and balance sheet requirements for liquidity and capital could be eased somewhat. Also, we believe the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau could be more restrained under a new administration, potentially lowering the risk of fines and costly corrective measures. Finally, new regulatory leadership could lessen or even reverse the anti-consolidation pressures that have emerged in recent years. In particular, we believe the significant excess capacity in banking (with over 4.300 chartered US banks) could lead to more strategic as well as scale-driven consolidation of smaller and mid-sized US banks.",

        "text": "Trump gunshots: America faces a new normal in political violence\nPolitical violence becomes America's new norm - but is still shocking\n\nSheriff describes moment suspect apprehended at Trump golf course\n\nAfter decades without political violence directed at a presidential candidate from one of the major parties, the US has now experienced this twice in the space of two months - with former president Donald Trump the target on both occasions. In mid-July, he narrowly avoided being shot in the head by a gunman at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The 20-year-old attacker was shot dead by a sniper. Two months later, on Sunday afternoon, during a round of golf, he was the apparent target of another would-be assassin, according to the FBI, with a suspect now in custody. Investigators said a man armed with an AK-47 style rifle was waiting in the bushes while Trump played on his West Palm Beach golf course before the alleged assailant was spotted by Secret Service agents, who opened fire. Americans have had to adjust to \u201cnew normals\u201d in politics \u2013 large and small - on a seemingly regular basis in the past few years. The national discourse has coarsened, partisan divisions have sharpened and become more entrenched, and the standards for candidate behaviour have eroded. Given the national epidemic of gun violence, these kind of attacks are perhaps another, inevitable new normal. But for now, it is still shocking.\n\n\u201cViolence has no place in America,\u201d Vice-President Kamala Harris - who is also Trump's Democratic opponent this election - said in a statement after the incident in Florida. Details of the apparent assassination attempt \u2013 the identity and motivation of the assailant in particular - will ultimately determine the impact this has on American politics. But, for the moment, it seems like \u2013 the vice-president\u2019s comments notwithstanding - this kind of violence is increasingly part of today\u2019s America. Donald Trump, in his first statement following the apparent attempt on his life, promised that nothing would slow him down or make him surrender. The response fits into a campaign that has often argued the former president has become a target of persecution and attack because he speaks out for the \u201cforgotten\u201d Americans. His words after his first near-assassination in July \u2013 \u201cfight, fight, fight\u201d \u2013 became a rallying cry for his supporters. \u201cThey\u2019re not coming after me, they\u2019re coming after you,\u201d Trump likes to say. \u201cI\u2019m just standing in the way.\u201d Now the former president has another dramatic example he can use to illustrate his point.\n\nWatch: Ros Atkins on\u2026the apparent Trump assassination attempt\n\nThis latest incident may not pack the emotional heft as the shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania, however. That attack happened at a public rally, in full view of television cameras, with the former president bloodied and defiant. One supporter was killed and two others wounded. This time around, the incident occurred on a golf course Trump owns, with the former president more removed from immediate danger. Without graphic images to replay for days, it may affect how much of an impact this has on the public\u2019s conscience. Election polls - is Harris or Trump winning? At the very least, however, the apparent assassination attempt will generate new headlines that at least temporarily break from what has been a challenging past few days for the former president\u2019s campaign. Trump\u2019s defensive, uneven performance during last week\u2019s debate against Ms Harris, criticism of his association with the conspiracy-minded Laura Loomer and Sunday morning\u2019s social media diatribe against singer Taylor Swift will be pushed to the side. Sunday\u2019s drama may be shocking, but with just over seven weeks remaining in this presidential campaign, there seem certain to be more twists to come.\n\nMore on US election",

Check state-by-state breakdown here\nThe race between Vice President Kamala Harris and Donald Trump is heating up. Following the first presidential debate in Philadelphia, Harris has experienced a boost in her polling numbers. This debate, held after President Joe Biden stepped down from the Democratic ticket in July, was the first direct face-off between Harris and Trump.\n\nAccording to recent polls, Harris was seen as the clear winner in the debate. But how does that translate to the broader race against Trump? Currently, Harris holds a 2.8-point lead over Trump, according to an average of national polls aggregated by FiveThirtyEight. This slim advantage has been a consistent trend, with Harris maintaining a marginal lead.\n\nHowever, a brand new Ipsos-Reuters poll conducted in the two days following the debate shows Harris pulling further ahead, with a +5-point lead. Among 1,405 registered voters, Harris stands at 47%, while Trump trails at 42%.\n\nAlso Read Elvish Yadav to Anurag Dobhal: Net worth of India\u2019s 8 richest YouTubers As Anil Ambani\u2019s Reliance companies\u2019 share prices are skyrocketing, here\u2019s a look at his journey, struggles, family, lifestyle, luxurious house, and more Sooni Tata and Ratanji Dadabhoy Tata\u2019s love story: Know how the two met and decided to marry \u2018I will give you a child and guard your cats with my life\u2019: Elon Musk\u2019s jab at Taylor Swift\u2019s election endorsement for Kamala Harris\n\nUS Presidential Election 2024: Harris gains momentum post-debate\n\nHarris has steadily increased her lead over Trump since taking over the Democratic nomination. The Ipsos poll indicates that Harris\u2019s margin has grown by 1 point since late August when she led by 4 points (45% to 41%).\n\nThis stronger lead suggests that the debate has positively impacted public perception of Harris, providing her campaign with a boost as Election Day nears.\n\nAll major polls indicate that Harris was perceived as the debate winner. Even a seasoned Republican pollster has cautioned that this spells trouble for Trump.\n\nUS Presidential Election 2024: Harris outshines Trump\n\nAcross the board, voters, including independents and Democrats, saw Harris as the debate winner. Notably, 14% of Republicans also felt Harris outperformed Trump. Most significantly, half of independent voters said Harris won, marking a dramatic shift from the June Biden-Trump faceoff, where 62% viewed Trump as the victor.\n\nWhile Republicans remain loyal, with 31% claiming neither candidate won the debate, there is a clear sign that confidence in Trump may be wavering. However, whether this shift will impact voting behaviour remains uncertain.\n\nUS Presidential Election 2024: State-by-state breakdown\n\nThe presidential race remains tightly contested in key battleground states. Harris and Trump are neck-and-neck in Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina. Trump holds a narrow +2-point lead in Florida and Arizona, states where he has historically performed well.\n\nTrump maintains strong leads in Ohio and Texas, while Harris is comfortably ahead in Maryland, Colorado and Virginia.\n\nAs the election draws closer, both candidates will be vying for votes in these pivotal states, where even the slightest shift could determine the outcome of the 2024 election.",

        "text": "Trump's running mate Vance doubles down on false 'pet-eating' claims\nVance doubles down on false 'pet-eating' claims\n\nGetty Images Vance defended the Trump campaign's choice to continue spreading false claims about Haitian migrants eating pets in Springfield, Ohio\n\nDonald Trump's running mate JD Vance has doubled down on false claims that migrants are eating household pets in an Ohio town, as city officials repeatedly debunked the rumours. The baseless claims have led to several security threats, and on Sunday Wittenberg University in Springfield said it had to cancel events because of a threat targeting members of its Haitian community. Appearing on Sunday talk shows, Vance defended the false stories, saying \"media totally ignored this stuff until Donald Trump and I started talking about cat memes\". \"If I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do,\" he told CNN.\n\n\u201cIt comes from firsthand accounts from my constituents. I say that we\u2019re creating a story, meaning we\u2019re creating the American media focusing on it.\" Vance is a US senator who represents Ohio. He first brought up the animal-eating claims last week, before Trump amplified them at his first presidential debate against Kamala Harris. Since then, Springfield city officials have repeatedly debunked the claims. Mayor Rob Rue told the BBC that the conspiracy theories - and Trump's pledge to \"mass deport\" migrants from Springfield - were hurting the town. \"People's pets are safe in Springfield, Ohio, \" Rue told the BBC\u2019s Newshour programme. \"We reached out to the JD Vance Campaign to let them know that we do not have any evidence that has happened, and I've made it known in multiple interviews that this is absolutely not true.\" \"We need folks to understand, especially those that have a microphone that's being listened to around the world, they need to understand the weight of their words and how it can negatively affect communities.\" Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, a Republican, on ABC's This Week called the rumours \"a piece of garbage that was simply not true\". Springfield had to evacuate three schools and other city buildings last week due to threats, at least one of which made disparaging comments about Haitians. Police at Wittenberg University said in a campus alert that an email sent on Saturday threatened a shooting the following day. \"The message targeted Haitian members of our community, \" police said. \"All students, faculty and staff should exercise extreme precaution and be alert to all your surroundings.\"\n\nSpringfield police have also said they received calls on Saturday about members of the Proud Boys marching in the city, after a video circulated on social media with a group of men carrying flags and wearing logos associated with the far-right group. Vance told CBS News on Sunday that he did not \"align himself\" with the Proud Boys but said the real problem was Harris's \"open borders\". Trump, like Vance, has doubled down on the baseless claims and said the town had been \"destroyed\" by immigration. Campaigning Friday in California, Trump vowed there would be \"large deportations\" from Springfield if elected. He has promised to deport millions of undocumented migrants nationwide. Springfield, a rust belt city in south-west Ohio, is home to about 60,000 people and has seen thousands of immigrants arrive in recent years. Many migrants in the town are from Haiti and have legal permission to be in the US under a federal programme for Haitians.",

WJP\u2019s latest nationally representative U.S. poll, administered to 1046 adults by YouGov in June, included new election-related questions.\n\nFindings include:\n\nClose to half of Republicans (46%) and more than a quarter of Democrats (27%) said they would not consider 2024 election results to be legitimate if the other party\u2019s presidential candidate won.\n\nSome of them would go further: 14% of Republicans and 11% of Democrats surveyed said they would take action to overturn the 2024 election based solely on who is declared the winner 1.\n\nOnly one-third of Republicans (34%) and two-thirds of Democrats (67%) believe election officials are trustworthy.\n\nOverall, Democrats have far more faith in many aspects of the electoral process, particularly when it comes to fraud prevention and accurate vote counting.\n\nHowever, less than half of Democrats (47%) would trust the Supreme Court to fairly determine the winner of a contested election, compared to two-thirds of Republicans (67%).\n\nThe proportion of Americans who believe a high-ranking official would be held accountable for breaking the law decreased from 60% to 35% in the last decade.\n\nMany more Democrats than Republicans trust \u201cthe courts,\u201d while many more Republicans trust \u201cthe Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nLarge majorities of Americans continue to hold strong anti-authoritarian and rule of law values, but these majorities are slowly declining.\n\nAround 13% of Americans (regardless of political affiliation) now say people do not need to obey the laws of a government they did not vote for.\n\nIn WJP\u2019s latest national poll, the most common word Americans used to briefly describe \u201cthe rule of law\u201d was \u201cjustice.\u201d However, the most common word they use to describe the current state of U.S. rule of law was \u2018\u201ccorrupt.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday, trust in many U.S. institutions, government accountability, and overall rule of law is considerably lower than it was ahead of the 2020 election,\u201d said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of the World Justice Project.\n\nDespite their concerns, 88% of Americans surveyed said they planned to vote this fall.\n\n\u201cThe good news is, despite polarization, both Democrats and Republicans still agree on the fundamental principles of the rule of law, and they want to participate in democracy,\u201d Andersen said.\n\nBut that alone won\u2019t ensure a stable election process, she added.\n\n\u201cDistrust in the electoral process should be a wake-up call going into the November election,\u201d Andersen said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s imperative that our public officials, media, community leaders, and informed citizens of all stripes work harder than ever to build trust in U.S. election integrity and commitment to the rule of law.\u201d\n\nExplore the full report and WJP's new \"Rule of Law Scorecard\" for political candidates at WorldJusticeProject.org/USruleoflaw\n\n###\n\nFor interviews and information: [email protected]\n\nAbout the World Justice Project\n\nThe World Justice Project (WJP) is an independent, nonpartisan, multidisciplinary organization working to create knowledge, build awareness, and stimulate action to advance the rule of law worldwide.

Kennedy Jr.\n\nLibertarian Chase Oliver\n\nAmerican Solidarity Party nominee Peter Sonski\n\nIndependent Jill Stein\n\nConstitution Party nominee Randall Terry\n\nRepublican candidate Donald Trump\n\nAurora Party nominee Cornel West\n\nKennedy announced in August that he would be suspending his presidential campaign and that he was endorsing Trump, but his campaign failed to remove his name from Alaska\u2019s ballot after the August primary election.\n\nNationally, Stein is the Green Party\u2019s presidential candidate; the Green Party of Alaska is unaffiliated with the national Green Party.\n\nAlaska will be the second state to use ranked choice voting in a presidential election, following Maine\u2019s experience in 2020.\n\nBut Maine\u2019s experience is incomplete; its 2020 election didn\u2019t need to use ranked choice tabulation because the winners of that election had at least 50% of the vote.\n\nIn Maine, as in Alaska, if a candidate earns more than 50% of the first-choice votes, they win without a need for ranked choice tabulation.\n\nMaine distributes its Electoral College votes by congressional district and by statewide vote. In 2020, Democratic candidate Joe Biden won the statewide vote \u2014 worth two Electoral College votes \u2014 and one of the state\u2019s congressional districts, while Republican candidate Donald Trump won the other congressional district.\n\nIn every one of Alaska\u2019s presidential elections since 1992, the winner of the state has earned more than 50% of the overall vote.\n\nFour years ago, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump won Alaska\u2019s three Electoral College votes after earning 52.8% of the state\u2019s presidential votes.

        "text": "US TikTok ban: When and why could the app be outlawed?\nUS TikTok ban: When and why could the app be outlawed?\n\nGetty Images\n\nTikTok is beginning its case against a law which will ban it in the US unless it is sold by ByteDance, its Chinese parent company. The video sharing app has millions of users worldwide, but has faced questions over the security of data and links to the government in Beijing.\n\nWho wants to ban TikTok in the US and why?\n\nLawmakers from both major US political parties supported a law that bans TikTok unless ByteDance agrees to sell to a non-Chinese company. They fear the Chinese government could force ByteDance to hand over data about TikTok's 170 million US users. TikTok insists it would not provide foreign user data to the Chinese government. In April, following approval by Congress, President Joe Biden signed a bill paving the way for TikTok's forced sale. Previous attempts to block the app in the US on national security grounds have failed. Former US President Donald Trump tried to ban the app when he was in the White House in 2020. But Mr Trump - the Republican 2024 presidential candidate - has criticised the new legislation, arguing that limiting TikTok would unfairly benefit Facebook. Vice President Kamala Harris, who is running against Mr Trump as the Democrat candidate, has used TikTok and popular social media trends like Charli XCX's \"brat\" to try and win over young voters. A spokesperson for her campaign has previously said they would \"just like to see a change in ownership\" of TikTok rather than its ban.\n\nWhen could TikTok be banned?\n\nMr Biden signing the bill into law did not mean an immediate US ban for TikTok, but it did start a ticking clock. The legislation gives ByteDance nine months to sell TikTok to a new buyer, with an additional three-month grace period, before any ban would take effect. TikTok said this could mean it is either forced to sell or shut down in the US by 19 January 2025, after the US presidential election in November. But the company's fight against the legislation in court, which began when it sued to block the law in May, could take years.\n\nHow would a TikTok ban work?\n\nThe most straightforward way for the US to ban TikTok would be to remove it from app stores, such as those operated by Apple and Google for iOS and Android devices.\n\nGetty Images\n\nApp stores are how most people download apps on to their smartphones and tablets, so the ban would stop new users from getting TikTok. It would also mean that people who already had the app would no longer be able to get future updates designed to improve security or fix bugs. The bill forbids applications controlled by US adversary countries from being updated and maintained in the US. It gives broad powers to the president to limit apps with ties to Russia, China, Iran and North Korea.\n\nWhat has TikTok said it will do about the ban?\n\nArguments in TikTok's appeal begin in a Washington DC court on Monday 16 September and will be heard by a three-judge panel. A group of TikTok creators who oppose the law over concerns about its impact on their work will also make their case at the hearing. TikTok has previously called the legislation an \"unconstitutional ban\" and affront to the US right to free speech. \"We are confident and we will keep fighting for your rights in the courts,\" said TikTok boss Shou Zi Chew. \"Rest assured,\" he told users in a video, \"we aren't going anywhere\". He previously said the bill would give its social media rivals more power and put thousands of American jobs at risk.\n\nGetty Images TikTok chief executive Shou Zi Chew studied at Harvard Business School and spent time at Facebook\n\nByteDance would also have to seek approval from Chinese officials to sell TikTok, but Beijing has vowed to oppose such a move.\n\nHow have TikTok users in the US responded?\n\nMany US creators and users have criticised the potential ban. Tiffany Yu, a young disability advocate from Los Angeles, told the BBC at a protest outside the White House the platform was vital to her work.\n\nWatch: How do young Americans feel about a ban on TikTok?\n\nIn March 2024, TikTok asked its 170 million US users to contact their political representatives and ask them not to support the bill. But the deluge of \"confused\" calls from TikTok users to congressmen and senators seemingly backfired. Several politicians said the campaign worsened the concerns they had about the app, and strengthened their resolve to pass the legislation.\n\nIs TikTok banned in other countries?\n\nIt is thought the US TikTok bill could inspire similar moves elsewhere. TikTok is already banned in India, which was one of the app's largest markets before it was outlawed in June 2020. It is also blocked in Iran, Nepal, Afghanistan and Somalia. The UK government and Parliament banned TikTok from staff work devices in 2023, as has the European Commission. The BBC also advised staff to delete TikTok from corporate phones because of security fears.\n\nHow does TikTok work and how much user data does it collect?",

        "text": "Suspicious packages sent to election officials across US\nSuspicious packages sent to election officials across US\n\nThe FBI said it is working to determine who sent the packages\n\nIt comes amid reports of rising threats directed at election officials across the US and warnings of political violence as November's presidential election approaches.\n\nThey were sent to secretaries of state and state election officials across a swathe of the country from New York to Alaska.\n\nFederal investigators said they were collecting the packages and that some contained \"an unknown substance\", though there were no reports of injuries.\n\nThe FBI and the US Postal Inspection Service are investigating suspicious packages received by election officials in 17 states.\n\nThe FBI and postal service said they were trying to determine how many letters were sent and who was behind them, as well as their motive.\n\n\u201cSome of the letters contained an unknown substance and we are working closely with our law enforcement partners to respond to each incident and safely collect the letters,\u201d the agencies said in a statement to BBC\u2019s US partner CBS News.\n\nThe Associated Press news agency reported that packages were sent to election officials in Alaska, Georgia, Connecticut, Indiana, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Missouri, New York, Rhode Island, Iowa, Mississippi, Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Wyoming.\n\nColorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold wrote in a post on X, formerly Twitter, that whoever posted the letters had called themselves as the \u201cUS Traitor Elimination Army\u201d.\n\nOfficials in at least four of the states said there was no threat posed by the substances found in the packages. In Oklahoma, the Board of Elections said the substance was found to be flour.\n\nIn an interview with CBS, Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, said her office was receiving threats daily through voicemails, emails, social media or in person, adding that \u201cit\u2019s escalating\u201d.\n\nThis is not the first time suspicious mail was mailed to US election offices.\n\nLast November, offices in Georgia, Nevada, California, Oregon and Washington were sent envelopes with fentanyl or other substances.\n\nFederal investigators are separately questioning a gunman who was found lurking in bushes on a Florida golf course where Trump was putting on Sunday.",

        "text": "Arizona's growing political influence, explained by a U of A political scientist\nArizona's political landscape is evolving, and the 2024 presidential election could mark a pivotal moment for the state. Lisa M. Sanchez, assistant professor in the University of Arizona School of Government and Public Policy, sees Arizona's growing population, diversity and shifting demographics as key factors in its transformation into a contentious political battleground.\n\nImage Lisa M. Sanchez\n\nAs Republicans and Democrats vie for control, the state's changing electorate is set to play a critical role in shaping the national outcome.\n\n\"Arizona is a shifting political landscape,\" Sanchez said. \"Historically, the state was sort of an easy win for conservatives. Now that we've seen an influx in population \u2013 and especially in the Latino community \u2013 we are starting to see Arizona as a state that is not so assured. That's a good thing for Democrats because they know the electoral content will matter, but it's a bad thing for Republicans who had seen the state as 'in the bag.' It's not.\"\n\nSanchez researches ethno-racial disparities in American politics and investigates key factors driving political participation across the country, with a focus on Latino voters and Congressional politics. Her recent work analyzes the adoption of immigration policies in American states, the prevalence of cross-racial ties among Americans of all racial and ethnic backgrounds, and the relationship between a growing Latino population and its electoral impact.\n\nThe United States Census Bureau recorded nearly 6.4 million Arizonans in 2010, and the Arizona Secretary of State lists 3.1 million registered voters that year. The Arizona Office of Economic Opportunity estimates Arizona's 2024 population to be roughly 7.6 million, and more than 4.1 million Arizonans were registered to vote at the time of the 2024 primary election. Of those 4.1 million, just over 1.4 million were registered as Republicans, 1.1 million as Democrats, nearly 1.4 million as Independent and more than 30,000 as Libertarians.\n\nWhile Arizona's voter roll and influence on elections has grown over the years, Sanchez said the issues that send voters to the ballot box remain relatively unchanged. Chief among those concerns, she said, is the economy \u2013 especially considering Phoenix is one of the fastest-growing cities in the United States.\n\nPeople often move to Arizona to pursue economic opportunities in a burgeoning economy and will keep their budgets in mind when voting for the next president, Sanchez said.\n\n\"It is very interesting to see the Kamala Harris campaign's outreach on economic issues,\" Sanchez said. \"She's been using the terminology of an 'Opportunity Economy.' I think that's a really wise decision on her part, especially when it comes to Latinos, many of whom have grown up with a high emphasis on the American Dream ethos and have some of the highest adherence to the idea that the American Dream is still alive. Her using that terminology \u2013 I don't think that's an accident.\"\n\nDonald Trump, on the other hand, takes a different approach.\n\n\"Trump is really making the case that voters haven't done great under a Biden economy, and that he is a businessman,\" Sanchez said. \"For many white voters, that plays really well; they are already thinking that business is where solutions are, and so they have high hopes. Trump makes that case very well, particularly in Arizona where small businesses are a really important part of the economy.\"\n\nAside from the economy, Sanchez said that reproductive rights and abortion access; immigration and border security; and educational attainment remain important issues for Arizona voters, regardless of race, nationality, gender or party affiliation.\n\nSanchez noted that increased political participation by Arizona's Latino population is driven, in part, by the fact that more women of Hispanic and Latino descent are heading to the polls, at a time when they are also taking on new roles at home.\n\n\"Latinas are increasingly heads of households,\" Sanchez said. \"When we look at the economic data, there are higher levels of engagement in the labor market, and they are starting to run more and more households for the first time. Hispanic women are in the driver's seat.\"",

        "text": "How the assassination attempt on Donald Trump is affecting US election bets and polls\nIn any other race, an assassination attempt on a candidate would have been the most dramatic and potentially game-changing event.\n\nThis race has now seen two on Donald Trump. And that follows already extraordinary affairs like the last-minute replacement of a sitting president as candidate.\n\nBut look at our recently launched poll tracker, and it looks as placid as an undisturbed puddle - US vice president Kamala Harris ahead, with minor fluctuations.\n\nAnd that's including some of the recent polls following the Trump-Harris debate.\n\nWhy so steady? Because it's an average of very many polls, because the polls themselves are slow to react to events, and also because so much of the electorate has already decided who they're voting for.\n\nBut if you want to get a sense of a real race, wheel-to-wheel, with candidates edging ahead and then falling behind one another, look at the betting data.\n\nYou can see events causing big shifts almost in real time, including the most recent apparent assassination attempt, which appears to show a small drop in the odds.\n\nCompare that with the rise he saw after the assassination attempt on 13 July.\n\nOr look at US President Joe Biden's odds falling away immediately after his debate with Mr Trump.\n\nAnd last week's Trump-Harris debate seems to have boosted Ms Harris's odds.\n\nThere are caveats to this - betting on presidential elections is banned in the US, so this is all from international bets.\n\nBut it's still a lot of money, with some \u00a366m having been bet so far, according to Betfair - and people are putting all that money where their mouths are.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:46 Trump v Harris debate: What happened\n\nRead more from Sky News:\n\n'I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!' Trump lashes out after star backs Harris\n\nWhere did Donald Trump's pet-eating claims come from?\n\nThe main takeaway is just how tight this is. That might seem odd when you look back again at the headline polling, showing a consistent Harris lead.\n\nBut because of the US system, and the electoral college, in which states award votes, Ms Harris needs to be significantly further ahead.\n\nFollow Sky News on WhatsApp Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky News Tap here\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free\n\nAnd the reason the race is so tight - the reason the betting markets show it moving so much, even if the polling doesn't - is we can't say whether Ms Harris's lead will be enough.\n\nRight now it's better than Hilary Clinton's in 2016 - where she won the popular vote and still lost the electoral college - but not as big as Mr Biden's in 2020.\n\nPollsters have different thoughts about how big her lead needs to be to translate to electoral college success.\n\nBut even then, in a swing state like Pennsylvania, one which is pivotal in this race, it could come down to a tiny fraction of the electorate.\n\nSpreaker Spreaker , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

        "text": "Christian Voters Will Play an Outsized Role in the US Election\nThis brief is part of \u201cElection 2024: Policy Playbook,\u201d a series by Rice University and the Baker Institute that offers critical context, analysis, and recommendations to inform policymaking in the United States and Texas.\n\nThe Big Picture\n\nReligion\u2019s influence in U.S. politics has surged, and Christian voters may have a greater impact on 2024\u2019s election results than ever before.\n\nTwo-thirds of Americans now identify as Christian, with an estimated 55% \u201cpracticing Christians,\u201d and often align with more conservative positions.\n\nPracticing Christians are much more likely to vote compared to other eligible voters \u2014 giving them an outsized influence on election outcomes.\n\nPracticing Christians are more likely to vote Republican than other eligible voters, except for Black Christians.\n\nSummarizing the Issue\n\nSince the 1960s, the link between religion, race, and voting patterns has intensified. Researchers today can use a person\u2019s specific religion and racial identities to determine voting behavior with significant accuracy. These insights are proving to be valuable tools for election analysts:\n\nAccording to Gallup , as of March 2024, two-thirds of adult Americans identify as Christian (Protestant, Catholic, Orthodox, or other another denomination), while just 7% of adult Americans identify with another religion.\n\nOf those who identify as Christian, analysis shows that 55% are practicing, meaning they self-identify as Christian, say faith is important in their lives, and attend church at least monthly. Thus, at least one-third of adult Americans are practicing Christians.\n\nAs the chart below indicates, Christian voting patterns vary by race \u2014 another powerful shaper of U.S. voting patterns.\n\nThe Christian Vote by Race\n\nThe percentage of practicing Christians who failed to vote in the 2016 presidential election is significantly less than for the general voting-eligible public, although this effect varies across each of the four major racial groups, as shown in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1 \u2014 Percentage of Eligible Adults Not Voting in the 2016 Presidential Election, By Race and Religion\n\nSource: Data courtesy of the Barna Group. Chart sourced from \u201cReligion, Race, and Justice Survey: 2020,\u201d August 2020.\n\nChristianity and Political Affiliation\n\nChristianity increases the probability of voting Republican, except for African Americans. Consider the 2016 presidential election, when practicing Christians were seemingly torn as to whether to vote for Donald Trump. He clearly wasn\u2019t \u201cone of them,\u201d there were \u201cNever Trump\u201d movements, and there were significant questions within Christian communities about his moral and ethical behaviors. Thus, the 2016 election serves as an excellent test of the impact of Christianity on presidential elections. Figure 2 compares all voting-eligible adults (divided by race) to practicing Christians as well as its evangelical subset:\n\nFigure 2 \u2014 Percentage of Adults Voters Who Voted for Donald Trump in the 2016 Presidential Election, by Race and Religion\n\nSource: Data courtesy of the Barna Group. Chart sourced from \u201cReligion, Race, and Justice Survey: 2020,\u201d August 2020.\n\nAs Figure 2 shows, a minority of the general voting population voted for Donald Trump in each racial category. But apart from African Americans \u2014 whose voting is primarily shaped by race rather than by the interaction of religion and race \u2014 the impact Christianity has on voting behavior is clearly significant. Hispanic practicing Christians are 38% more likely to have voted for Donald Trump than the general population of Hispanic voters. When looking just at evangelical Hispanics, the majority (57%) cast their vote for Trump. The pattern for Asian and white voters is even stronger. Only one-fourth of general Asian voters voted for Trump, but over half of Asian practicing Christians did (57%). And for Asian evangelicals, that figure climbs close to two-thirds. For white voters, a slight minority voted for Trump (48%), but for white practicing Christians, two-thirds cast their vote for him. And for white evangelicals, 80% voted for Donald Trump, just as they did in the 2020 election.\n\nAn Outsized Impact on Elections\n\nThe implication of these voting patterns is significant: Because practicing Christians form a sizable portion of the American electorate and vote at a much higher rate than other adults, they have an outsized influence on election outcomes beyond their numbers. According to current analysis, that influence includes a significantly increased likelihood that their turnout will primarily benefit Republican candidates. African American Christians are the exception as they vote overwhelmingly for Democratic candidates, regardless of religious commitments.\n\nWhy does this pattern occur? Several factors contribute to it, but one factor is the tie between Christian religious or community commitments and the spectrum of conservativism. My colleague and I asked a nationally representative sample of adults a series of questions about their views on social, moral, economic, and government issues. Figure 3 shows the average percentage of adults, by race and religion, who said that they held mostly conservative or very conservative views on these issues.\n\nFigure 3 \u2014 Average Percentage of Voters Who Identify as Mostly or Very Conservative on Social, Economic, and Government Authority Issues\n\nSource: Data courtesy of the Barna Group. Chart sourced from \u201cReligion, Race, and Justice Survey: 2020,\u201d August 2020.\n\nStrikingly, a comparison of Figures 2 and 3 shows a close correlation between how Christian voters identify on issues, regardless of affiliation, and how they actually vote. This mirroring of the data suggests that religion and religious communities shape a web of intertwined, ostensibly nonreligious factors that affect voting patterns, such as views on economics, government authority, fiscal responsibility, and social issues.\n\nExpert Analysis\n\nDue to significant changes in immigration laws (which opened the door to greater numbers of non-European immigrants) and several prominent social movements (such as those focusing on civil rights, feminism, and greater church/state separation), the 1960s gave rise to momentous social changes. America became far more diverse and pluralistic, and challenges to the status quo were frequent.\n\nFollowing the 1960s, the link between religion, race, and politics began to crystallize. With movements such as Jerry Falwell\u2019s Moral Majority beginning in the late 1970s, how Christians viewed political issues outside of their religious communities became increasingly defined or even proscribed \u2014 including their views on the obligation to vote and who to vote for.\n\nThrough what is now several decades of change \u2014 including a growing tendency of people to self-identify with specific communities and increasing polarization between these groups \u2014 Christianity has become wound together with a host of political issues and linked with clear voting patterns. Practicing Christians largely vote Republican. This effect is strongest for white Americans, followed closely by Asian Americans. Hispanic Americans, too, are more likely to vote Republican if they are practicing Christians, though only in the majority if they identify specifically as evangelicals. African Americans are the exception to this pattern as they have overwhelmingly voted Democratic since the 1960s, whether they are practicing Christians or not. For this group, race is a far more important factor than the interaction of religion and race.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nReligion is a potent factor in elections, and the role of Christianity in 2024\u2019s political landscape will be significant. With the rise of newer organized movements, such as Christian nationalism, and the impact of polarized news and social media outlets, the voting behaviors of practicing Christians may have an even more pronounced impact on results than in past election cycles.\n\nThis material may be quoted or reproduced without prior permission, provided appropriate credit is given to the author and Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute for Public Policy.

        "text": "Republican allies boost longshot candidate Jill Stein as Democrats try to remove her from ballots in battleground states\nJill Stein, now on her third run for president with the Green Party, is seen as a longshot for the White House and often called a spoiler candidate who pulls votes from the Democratic side.\n\nThough Stein claims her candidacy has a legitimate path to victory without relying on what she calls \"war machine\" dollars, her campaign has accepted support from Republican allies as she works to secure ballot access in multiple states, including key battleground states like Nevada and Wisconsin, where CBS News polling shows a close race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump.\n\nIn Nevada, where the Green Party was removed from the ballot earlier this month because of incorrect petition forms, according to the Nevada Supreme Court, the party is seeking reinstatement and is being represented by Jay Sekulow, an attorney who represented Trump during his impeachment trials.\n\n\"In case you missed it, the @NVSOS gave the campaign the wrong forms to use to get on the ballot. Then the dirty Dems used that technicality to sue us off the ballot - we won in lower courts, only to lose in the NV Supreme Court,\" Stein wrote on X last week. \"Our lawyers have said that we have a case that the US Supreme Court may take which will make ripples nationwide.\"\n\nGreen Party presidential nominee Jill Stein speaks during the People's 1st Convention at Casablanca in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on July, 13, 2024. Joel Angel Juarez for The Washington Post via Getty Images\n\nOn Friday, the Nevada Green Party asked for emergency intervention from the U.S. Supreme Court to review the Nevada Supreme Court's ruling under the pro bono guidance of Sekulow, the Stein campaign told CBS News.\n\nIn Wisconsin, where the state Supreme Court ruled to keep Stein on the ballot after declining to hear a Democratic National Committee challenge, Stein accepted legal representation from Michael D. Dean, a Wisconsin lawyer involved in lawsuits attempting to overturn the 2020 election results on behalf of Trump, according to an ethics complaint filed by the bipartisan group The 65 Project.\n\nWhile Democratic allies claim that Stein's collaboration with Trump-affiliated lawyers is disqualifying, her campaign argues that it's simply responding to efforts to keep them off the ballot, leaving them no choice but to accept support wherever it comes from \u2014 even if it's from Trump allies.\n\n\"When the Democrats put us in a position of having to respond to a legal challenge, we're going to take the help that's available to us,\" said Jason Call, Jill Stein's campaign manager. \"And so the fault begins and ends with the Democratic Party on this. We understand that Republicans are going to want to help us for their own reasons, but our reasons are for democracy.\"\n\nThe Stein campaign learned over the weekend that yet another lawsuit had been filed against the third-party candidate in New Hampshire. In response, the campaign stated it is ready to accept assistance from partisan lawyers if it has to in order to secure ballot access.\n\nWhile there are no laws barring a third-party candidate from accepting pro bono support from another major party in any state, Democratic allies are pushing back on Stein's ballot access efforts.\n\n\"These third-party candidates are being presented to voters without a full picture of their views, their financial backers, and the impact they would have on the election,\" said Joel Payne, chief communications officer for MoveOn, a left-leaning political action committee. \"They also need to be held accountable in good faith or within the bounds of the law\u2014no differently than major party candidates.\"\n\nThe tug-of-war between Republican and Democratic Party allies to influence the outcome of the election extends to other third-party candidates as well. Recent Associated Press reporting shows that Cornel West has a network of GOP operatives supporting his campaign, while Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who suspended his presidential bid last month and endorsed Trump, is now working to remove himself from ballots in states where he believes his candidacy could siphon votes away from Trump.\n\n\"It seems unity is only convenient for some people when it aligns perfectly with their agenda,\" said Edwin DeJesus, spokesperson for the West campaign. \"Yet, when lawyers with certain political leanings support Dr. Cornel West, who has consistently spoken out about genocide, it's suddenly a problem.\"\n\nBoth Stein and West have faced numerous legal challenges from Democratic Party allies aimed at removing them from ballots in various states.\n\n\"Jill Stein has no path to win the presidency, but just like she did in 2016, she can help Trump win,\" said Democratic National Committee spokesperson Matt Corridoni. \"That's why the GOP is doing everything in their power to get third-party candidates on the ballot as spoilers in key swing states. Voters should see this cynical effort for what it is. The fact remains: only two candidates have a path to 270 and the only way to stop Donald Trump is by voting for VP Harris.\"\n\nBoth parties working to influence the ballot outcome in multiple states through third-party candidates isn't new, experts say.\n\n\"It's smart politics, on the Trump end, to try to siphon votes off from Harris,\" said John Geer, political science professor at Vanderbilt University. \"Politics is not for the faint of heart, and you've got to be ready for a lot of 'unfair' things to happen because it's war, it's a winner takes all contest, and finishing second place is no consolation.\"\n\nTrump, who has embraced Kennedy as an ally, has previously spoken fondly of both Stein and West.\n\n\"Cornel West, he's one of my favorite candidates,\" Trump said during a campaign rally in Philadelphia in June. \"I like her also, Jill Stein, I like her very much. You know why? She takes 100% from them. He takes 100%.\"",
