        "text": "Arizona pushes abortion to centre stage before US election\nArizona pushes abortion to centre stage before US election\n\nGetty Images Donald Trump has said Arizona's Supreme Court went \"too far\" by paving the way for a near-total ban on abortions in the state.\n\nThe Arizona Supreme Court on Tuesday pushed the abortion issue to centre stage in a state that could be pivotal in deciding who wins November's US presidential election.\n\nIt has prompted Democrats to go on the attack, and set many Republicans scrambling to align themselves more closely with the public sentiment.\n\nThe court paved the way for a near-total ban on abortion, a law passed in 1864 when Arizona was still a US territory, to go into effect in the coming weeks if there is no further legal action. The law had been pre-empted for nearly a half-century, as a result of the 1973 US Supreme Court ruling in Roe v Wade that guaranteed a woman's right to abortion.\n\nTwo years ago, however, the US Supreme Court overturned that abortion precedent. This gave old bans like the one in Arizona - which became a state in 1912 - new life.\n\nThe Arizona court decision prompted quick condemnation from the Biden administration as well as from local Democrats and pro-choice activists.\n\n\"This ruling is a result of the extreme agenda of Republican elected officials who are committed to ripping away women's freedom,\" the president said in a statement provided by the White House.\n\nWhile anti-abortion groups heralded the decision, many Republicans have distanced themselves from the state court action, reflecting polls that suggest a majority of the public - in the US and in Arizona - favour abortion rights and oppose strict bans on the procedure.\n\nThe party had largely opposed abortion before Roe was overturned, but is now grappling with the fallout from that decision. Kari Lake, the presumptive Republican nominee for an open Arizona Senate seat, provided a vivid illustration of the challenges and contradictions the abortion issue is presenting for conservative candidates.\n\nIn a statement released on Tuesday, the former television news presenter condemned the court ruling and said that the 1864 law, which she had previously supported, was \"out of step with Arizonans\". She said Arizona voters would have the chance to decide the abortion issue in the forthcoming ballot referendum - although she has said she is against its passage.\n\nShe called on the Democrat who beat her in 2022, Governor Katie Hobbs, to work with the Republican-controlled legislature to find a \"common sense\" solution - without spelling out what that would entail.\n\nOn Monday, former President Donald Trump released a short video detailing his own shifting position, which included leaving the ultimate decision on legality to individual states. It was a message that Ms Lake echoed.\n\n\"I wholeheartedly agree with President Trump,\" she said. \"This is a very personal issue that should be determined by each individual state and her people.\"\n\nBy Wednesday, Mr Trump himself had weighed in on the Arizona ruling, saying it had gone \"too far\".\n\nWhile the Arizona Supreme Court left the door open to further legal challenges, if the 1864 ban goes into effect it could provide a stark illustration for voters of what individual states determining abortion policy can look like.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the Florida Supreme Court ruled that the state's six-week abortion ban could go into effect. This has fuelled speculation the issue could make the large state, which has trended toward Republican of late, a key presidential battleground.\n\nNow there's a new ground zero in the national abortion fight.\n\nArizona is already an electoral battleground. Joe Biden was the first Democrat in 24 years to win the state, with its 11 electoral votes, by a margin of about 10,000 votes. If he can repeat the feat there, it gives the president a path to victory even if he drops other closely contested states he won four years ago, like Wisconsin, Nevada and Georgia.\n\nThe state's Senate race, between Ms Lake and Democrat Ruben Gallego, will also help determine which party controls the upper chamber of Congress.\n\nWith the abortion-rights referendum expected to appear on the November ballot, Democrats were already hoping the issue would help drive turnout from voters more inclined to support Mr Biden and the rest of the party's slate of candidates.\n\nSimilar abortion-rights measures have passed in every state that has put them to a vote, including Republican-dominated states like Kansas, Kentucky and Ohio. Democrats have campaigned aggressively on the abortion issue, and the connection is widely considered to have helped the party post better-than-expected results in the 2022 midterm congressional elections.\n\nIn a March Fox News poll, 39% of Arizona voters said abortion would be \"extremely important\" in determining the presidential candidate they would support in November, and that those voters were much more likely to back Mr Biden.\n\nWith the state court's decision, the stakes have only been raised. November's ballot measure could determine whether Arizona enshrines abortion rights in its constitution, or has a virtual ban on the procedure.",

        "text": "HPU Poll: N.C. Registered Voters Say Inflation and National Security Are Top Issues for D.C.\nThe latest High Point University Poll finds that a large majority of self-identified registered voters in North Carolina (76%) believe inflation is a very important issue for policymakers in Washington, D.C., to deal with, more than other issues in the poll.\n\nPresidential approval at 37%, U.S. Congress at 19% among N.C. registered voters\n\nMajorities of N.C. registered voters said the country and state are on the wrong track\n\nHIGH POINT, N.C., April 11, 2024 \u2013 The latest High Point University Poll finds that self-identified registered voters in North Carolina are split in their intended votes for U.S. president and U.S. Congress, as well as North Carolina governor, House of Representatives and Senate.\n\nElection for President, N.C. Governor and U.S. Congress\n\nThe most recent HPU Poll included self-identified registered voters who were asked who they would vote for if elections were held today. When asked about their choices for U.S. president, 45% of these registered voters said they would vote for Donald Trump and 42% said they would vote for Joe Biden. Another 6% said they were unsure who they would vote for, and 8% said they would vote for another party\u2019s candidate if one were on the ballot.\n\nWhen asked about their choices for North Carolina governor, 37% of these registered voters said they would vote for Democrat Josh Stein if the election were held today and 34% of these registered voters said they would vote for Republican Mark Robinson. In addition, 4% said they would vote for another party\u2019s candidate if one were on the ballot, and 25% were unsure.\n\nWhen asked about their choices for U.S. Congress, 44% of these registered voters said they would vote for the Republican Party\u2019s candidate if the election were held today, 42% said they would vote for the Democratic Party\u2019s candidate and 5% said they would vote for another party\u2019s candidate if one were on the ballot.\n\nElection for N.C. House of Representatives and Senate\n\nWhen asked about their choices for North Carolina House of Representatives, 45% of these registered voters said they would vote for the Republican Party\u2019s candidate if the election were held today and 42% said they would vote for the Democratic Party\u2019s candidate. Another 4% said they would vote for another party\u2019s candidate if one were on the ballot.\n\nWhen asked about their choices for North Carolina Senate, 46% of these registered voters said they voted or would vote for the Republican Party\u2019s candidate if the election were held today. Meanwhile, 40% said they would vote for the Democratic Party\u2019s candidate, and 5% said they would vote for another party\u2019s candidate if one were on the ballot.\n\nNational Issue Importance and Ownership\n\nMore North Carolina registered voters said inflation (76%), national security (73%), school safety (69%), health care in general (68%), and supporting veterans (68%) are very important issues for policymakers in Washington, D.C., to deal with than any of the other issues in the poll.\n\nMajorities of these same respondents said protecting democracy (65%), gas prices (64%), taxes (64%), education (63%), immigration (62%), voting integrity (60%), law enforcement (59%), guns (56%), civil rights (54%) and agriculture (52%) are very important issues for Washington to deal with.\n\nLess than 50% of North Carolina registered voters said that abortion (49%), climate change (42%), the war between Israel and Hamas (38%), the war in Ukraine (33%), and COVID-19 (32%) are very important issues for policymakers in D.C. to deal with.\n\nThe poll also asked North Carolina registered voters which political party in Washington, D.C., would do a better job dealing with each of the issues. At least 10% more registered voters said Republicans would do a better job dealing with the issues of gas prices (13%), national security (12%), inflation (12%), supporting veterans (11%), immigration (11%) and law enforcement (11%) than Democrats.\n\nMore registered voters said Democrats would do a better job dealing with the issues like climate change (20% difference between the parties), civil rights (15%), abortion (12%), COVID-19 (9%), health care in general (8%) and education (5%). Republicans probably have smaller advantages on issues like taxes (6%) and agriculture (5%).\n\nThere is not much difference between how well self-identified North Carolina registered voters overall think Republicans and Democrats deal with issues like protecting democracy, school safety, voting integrity, the wars in Ukraine or between war Israel and Hamas, and guns.\n\nApproval Ratings and Favorability\n\nRegistered voters also gave President Biden a job approval rating of 37%. In addition, 69% said the country is on the wrong track, and 51% said North Carolina is on the wrong track. More than half of registered voters in North Carolina disapproved of the job that the U.S. Congress (65%) is doing, and the U.S. Supreme Court has a job approval rating of 38%.\n\nThe poll asked registered voters in North Carolina whether they have favorable or unfavorable views about a list of people or things that are in the news. More than 40% of these registered voters had a favorable view of Roy Cooper (53%), Donald Trump (45%), the U.S. Supreme Court (41%), the North Carolina Supreme Court (41%), the Democratic Party (41%) and the Republican Party (41%). Less than that had favorable views of Joe Biden (39%), the North Carolina General Assembly (38%), Josh Stein (34%) and Mark Robinson (31%). Over half said they have an unfavorable view of the U.S. Congress (63%). Majorities were unfamiliar with Jeff Jackson (63%) and Dan Bishop (60%).\n\nConfidence in Elections\n\nThe poll asked registered voters in North Carolina how much confidence they have that the 2024 election results will accurately reflect the votes that are cast. One-third (34%) said a lot of confidence, 39% said some confidence and 21% said no confidence. Registered voters were also asked how satisfied they are with the choices of candidates for the 2024 elections. Over half (59%) were either very satisfied (21%) or somewhat satisfied (38%). About one-third (35%) said they are not at all satisfied with their choices of candidates.\n\nWhen asked about mudslinging and negative campaigning in the 2024 presidential election, a majority (64%) said there will be more than in past elections while about one-quarter (23%) said it will be about the same. About the 2024 North Carolina gubernatorial election, just less than half (44%) said there will be more mudslinging and negative campaigning than past elections while 37% said it will be about the same.\n\nA considerable majority (66%) of registered voters in North Carlina said it is very easy to register to vote in North Carolina. A little more than one-quarter (28%) said it was somewhat easy to register to vote, and 6% said it was either somewhat difficult or very difficult.\n\nMore than one-third (37%) of registered voters said they would consider voting for a third-party candidate, not a Democrat or Republican, for president in 2024. About two in five (43%) said they would not vote for a third-party candidate, while 1 in 5 (20%) were unsure.\n\n\u201cWe are a long way from the general election in November 2024, but the top of the ballot races look very close at this point,\u201d said Dr. Martin Kifer, chair of HPU\u2019s Department of Political Science and director of the HPU Poll.\n\nN.C.

Dynata sent invitations to its panel of N.C. respondents and the SRC collected 1,016 responses on its Qualtrics platform. All respondents were asked two screening questions to identify them as registered voters. A total of 829 respondents identified themselves as registered voters. The SRC did all data analysis. The online sample is from a panel of respondents, and their participation does not adhere to usual assumptions associated with random selection. Therefore, it is not appropriate to assign a classic margin of sampling error for the results. In this case, the SRC provides a credibility interval of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points to account for a traditional 95% confidence interval for the estimates (plus or minus 3.1 percentage points) and a design effect of 1.2 (based on the weighting). For the registered voter sample, the credibility interval is plus or minus 3.7 percentage points (3.4 for a margin of error and a design effect of 1.2). The data is weighted toward population estimates for age, gender, race, ethnicity, and education based on U.S. Census numbers for North Carolina. Factors such as question wording and other methodological choices in conducting survey research can introduce additional errors into the findings of opinion polls. Percentages may not add to 100 because of rounding.\n\nFurther results and methodological details from the most recent survey and past surveys can be found at the Survey Research Center website.

        "text": "Timeline: Haiti\u2019s history and current crisis, explained\n1492: The \u201cBeginning\u201d of History\n\nChristopher Columbus lands on what is now known as Hispaniola (the island shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic) and claims it for Spanish monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella. While this has been regarded as the beginning of Haiti\u2019s written history, the island had been inhabited by indigenous Ta\u00edno (who referred to the land as Ayiti) since the BC era and had a rich history long before Spanish conquest.\n\nAn engraving by Theodor de Bry of Christopher Columbus landing on Hispaniola on Dec. 6, 1492. (Image: Library of Congress)\n\n1496-1697: Spanish Colonization\n\nIn 1496, the first Spanish settlement on Hispaniola (and the first European settlement in the western hemisphere) is established in what is now present-day Dominican Republic. Five years later, after all but decimating the population of Ta\u00edno people, Spain brings 1,600 kidnapped and enslaved African people to the island to work in gold mines and on sugar plantations.\n\n1625-97: French Colonization\n\nThe first French settlers establish a colony on Tortuga Island and in the northwestern area of Haiti\u2019s mainland, naming the territory Saint-Domingue. In the latter part of the 17th Century, under Louis XIV, France authorizes African slave trade in the territory and introduces the Code Noir, which not further restricts the rights of enslaved people \u2014 as well as the rights of free people of color \u2014 in all French territories .\n\nIn 1697, Spain cedes its territory in western Hispaniola to France. Under French rule, Saint-Domingue is the country\u2019s richest colony in the 18th Century, producing half of all the sugar and coffee bought and sold in Europe and accounting for one-third of the Atlantic slave trade.\n\nAn engraving by Nicolace Ponce of Cap Fran\u00e7ais (present-day Cap-Ha\u00eftien), 1791. (Photo: New York Public Library Digital Collections)\n\n1789-1804: Revolution(s)\n\nThe 1789 French Revolution makes more people \u2014 on both sides of the Atlantic \u2014 outspoken for the rights of Black and indigenous people of color in the colony. France violently represses this activism, which leads to the beginning of the Haitian Revolution in 1791.\n\nThe Haitian Revolution continues for more than a decade, destroying much of Haiti\u2019s agricultural resources and infrastructure. On December 4, 1803, French forces surrender to Jean-Jacques Dessalines in the northwestern commune of Gona\u00efves. For the first time in over 300 years, Haiti is once again an independent nation.\n\n1804-20: A Fractured Peace and Civil War\n\nOn January 1, 1804, Dessalines assumes the role of Governor-General. He declares himself Emperor later that year, and is assassinated two years later. This leads to a Haitian civil war between the north and south that lasts until 1820. Reunification following the second peace excludes Black Haitians from power.\n\nHaiti's independence from France came at a cost: Reparations that cost the country approximately $20 billion that were paid through high-interest loans. The final payment was made in 1947.\n\n1825-1914: Independence, But At A Cost\n\nFrench King Charles X agrees to formally recognize Haiti as an independent nation, provided that the country pay 150 million francs in reparations to France (approximately $21 billion in today\u2019s currency, according to Forbes). Haiti takes out high-interest loans from American, German, and French banks to cover the cost (approximately 80% of the country\u2019s annual national budget and 10 times its annual revenue).\n\nIn 1838, France reduces this debt from 150 million to 90 million francs (ca. $12.6 billion). The final payment on the double-debt of Haiti's reparations to France and its loans from the United States is made in 1947, nearly 150 years after independence.\n\n1915-37: American Occupation and the Parsley Massacre\n\nAfter a series of border disputes with the Dominican Republic and short-lived presidencies culminating in the assassination of leader Jean Vilbrun Guillaume Sam, the United States invades Haiti in 1915 to protect its investments in-country. The United States withdraws its forces in 1934.\n\nThree years later, Dominican forces under the orders of President Rafael Trujillo kill an estimated 30,000 Haitians living in the border zone between the two countries in what\u2019s known today as the Parsley Massacre.\n\n1954-71: Fran\u00e7ois \u201cPapa Doc\u201d Duvalier Takes Power\n\nShortly after Haiti celebrates 150 years of independence, Hurricane Hazel makes landfall in the country in October 1954, killing 1,000 and destroying coffee and cocoa crops at the beginning of harvest season. In 1957, following two failed elections, physician Fran\u00e7ois \u201cPapa Doc\u201d Duvalier seizes power. His cult of personality turns despotic the following year when he establishes death squads to silence his opponents. In 1964, Duvalier declares himself president for life, a title he maintains until his death in 1971.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Duvalier during his 1957 presidential campaign (Photo: Wikimedia Commons / Public Domain)\n\n1971-86: The Reign and Fall of Jean-Claude \u201cBaby Doc\u201d Duvalier\n\nFollowing Duvalier\u2019s death, his 19-year-old son, Jean-Claude \u201cBaby Doc\u201d Duvalier, assumes the title of president for life. A popular revolt in 1986, however, leads to Baby Doc fleeing Haiti. He is replaced by Lieutenant-General Henri Namphy.\n\n1987-88: Leslie Manigat Elected and Overthrown\n\nThe elections of 1987 are delayed following the assassinations of two candidates and a massacre of Haitian voters. Military-run elections in January 1988 declare Leslie Manigat the winner. He is overthrown in a military coup led by Namphy six months later. In September, Namphy himself is overthrown by General Prosper Avril.",

Another terrific turnout for the space community\u2026thanks to everybody.Now it\u2019s been brought to my attention that today is the 112th anniversary of the maiden voyage of the Titanic.Not an event normally associated with space so you might wonder why that is of any importance to our space community\u2026 but in fact that disaster resulted in the first ever International Conference on the Safety of Life at Sea and the establishment of the International Ice Patrol.And these new initiatives paved the way for greater international cooperation in the sea domain, including stronger communications requirements, and shared domain awareness\u2026 in this case of course tracking and reporting icebergs \u2013 this goes to show space operators are not the only ones worried about hazardous chunks floating around in their domain.And it is in this same vein of safety that we\u2019re working hard on similar arrangements, but hopefully we won\u2019t need a Titanic-level catastrophe to drive international cooperation.Instead, we are strengthening our international efforts on space control, space cooperation and space classification to increase communication and collaboration to prevent a disaster in space.This includes full spectrum collaboration with our allies and industry\u2026planning, operations, situational awareness, information sharing, capabilities development, and everything in between.That\u2019s why this week, this gathering, is so important for the space community and so important for allies and partners.I don\u2019t think I have to convince this crowd how important space is to the Joint fight \u2013 it is in the DNA of this event.Back in 2007, I was a Commander at the 614th Space Operations Squadron, General Kevin Chilton, then Air Force Space Command Commander, talked about how \u201cspace had become integral to virtually every combat operation whether it is on land, sea, undersea, or in the air.\u201dIn 2016, Deputy Secretary of Defense Bob Work said, \u201cour space capabilities are central to our ability to project power anywhere on the globe\u2026they contribute to every aspect of the Joint multi-dimensional battle networks we assemble to fight and prevail over any opponent.\u201dAnd in 2022, our first Chief of Space Operations, General Jay Raymond, said, \u201cIf we lose our access and ability to operate freely in space\u2026we all lose.\u201dAnd just last year, my good friend, Admiral Sam Papparo while serving as the PACFLEET Commander told the PACOM Commander in an exercise, \u201cIf space is off plan, then I\u2019m off plan.\u201dSeveral different decades, several different leaders, from several different services but the same message \u2013 Our success on the battlefield, no matter the location or domain, is tied to our success in space.And I agree with them. I have been a part of this evolution personally for decades.Back in the day, it was common for planners to think of space as being kind of the \u201cicing on the cake\u201d making things better but only added in to the final product after it was fully baked.But that changed over the years and today I think the better analogy is that space is like the eggs in the batter.It is integral to the final product, a critical ingredient and once baked, it's impossible to separate.So, we do space superiority not for space\u2019s sake, we do space superiority as a critical part of the joint team, an essential element to meeting military objectives.The talking points are well known to this crowd\u2026the Air Force uses position, navigation, and timing to increase the accuracy of their munitions.The Navy uses satellite communications to provide seamless connectivity across vast maritime expanses.The Army uses tactical warning and environmental monitoring to plan and execute ground maneuvers.But now let\u2019s go a step further. Our use of space is not just limited to the military.Our economy, as with that of the rest of the world, is also dependent on unfettered access to the domain.As this crowd understands, our very way of life is directly tied to space!Remote sensing satellites provide key data for monitoring soil, snow cover, drought, and crop development.This information helps famers plan the timing and amount of irrigation they will need for crops.The precise timing provided by the GPS constellation is crucial to a variety of economic activities around the world.Communication systems, electrical power grids, and financial networks all rely on precision timing for synchronization.Wireless telephone and data networks rely on GPS timing, companies worldwide use GPS to time-stamp business transactions to ensure accuracy and traceability.Power companies rely on this timing signal for power transmission and distribution.The list goes on. In short, space capabilities and the continued access to a safe, stable, and secure space domain is a vital U.S. interest.That is why collaboration and cooperation between all space stakeholders is essential.The Space Force is committed to enhancing its partnerships with the commercial space industry, our allies, and other international partners.Today, though we find ourselves in the midst of a Great Power Competition with our adversaries that extends from the traditional terrestrial war fighting domains into space itself.As Russia has reminded us, war can return quickly, and in unexpected ways.Cooperation among industry leaders and allies has proven particularly effective in challenging Russia\u2019s efforts in Ukraine.And throughout our nation\u2019s history, military success has hinged on support from commercial industry.During the Spanish American War in 1898, the U.S. Navy relied heavily on commercial coaling stations to support its naval operations.The war, fought in both the Caribbean and the Pacific, proved naval power to be decisive, allowing expeditionary forces to disembark at desired locations unconstrained by distance.These \u201crefueling stations\u201d in Singapore, Hong Kong, Honolulu, Manilla \u2013 which were run by the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company, and the Oceanic Steamship Company \u2013 were vital to replenishing coal supplies during the war, enabling our naval ships to extend their range and remain operational for extended periods.And over the past 2 decades, the demand for military satellite communication bandwidth increased dramatically due to the heavy reliance on bandwidth-intensive operations\u2026 operations like aerial vehicle feeds-unmanned aerial vehicle feeds.To offset this demand, the Air Force partnered with Inmarsat and Intelsat to meet the rising operational demand.Now these two historical examples highlight the spectrum of commercial connections to military operations.So whereas the SATCOM example shows how commercial capabilities can add extra capacity when needed, the coaling stations represent a more complete integration into military operations.The Navy\u2019s operational infrastructure at that time was not complete without the commercial services completely incorporated.In space operations we have become more comfortable with using commercial capabilities to add capacity than we have with fully integrated commercial capabilities into our force design.It is this basic thought that led to the US Space Force\u2019s Commercial Space Strategy.Now, first I want to set some expectations for this document, released today in fact.If you read the strategy expecting to see answers to the most challenging problems of commercial integration, you will be disappointed.If you are expecting the document to outline how much money is available for us to dole out for each mission area, you will be disappointed.But, if you understand that effective integration will only come about with a common understanding of our priorities, the missions where we need help, our proposal evaluation criteria, and clear definitions of terms to enhance that collaboration\u2026I think you will find the document useful.Useful as a tool to drive process change, to shift our mindset and useful to see the Space Force\u2019s relationship with industry in a new light.As Secretary of Defense Austin stated in OSD\u2019s Commercial Space Integration Strategy, \u201cIntegrating commercial solutions, as opposed to merely augmenting existing government systems, will require a shift in approach within the Department.\u201dThe Space Force\u2019s Commercial Space Strategy is dual signed by myself and the Service Acquisition Executive, the honorable Frank Calvelli, because this is a partnership between the acquisitions community and the broader operational Space Force.Together, we are going to ensure we are optimizing resiliency and capability by balancing the decisions necessary to shift our approach.The Space Force Commercial Space Strategy follows OSD\u2019s 4 guiding principles for effective commercial integration:First, Balance \u2013 We will appropriately balance government and commercial solutions.Number two is Interoperability \u2013 We will strengthen interoperability between government and commercial solutions without stifling commercial sector innovation, speed, or scale.Third is Resilience \u2013 We will strengthen resilience by increasing the number of commercial providers, diversifying supply chains, and expanding the variety and number of solutions used.And four, Responsible Conduct \u2013 We will continue to support international norms and the DoD Tenets of Responsible Behavior in Space.And these guiding principles will assist decision-makers as they work through the myriad of activities needed to put together the force design. A force design which effectively accounts for and integrates commercial offerings.The Space Force Commercial Space Strategy will be implemented across 4 Lines of Effort.The first Line of Effort we call Collaborative Transparency.All stakeholders must be aware of the capabilities and limitations of their partners if we are to work together to solve our operational challenges.By building partnerships, collaborating with the commercial sector, the Space Force will enhance its competitive advantage by developing a comprehensive understanding of the commercial sector\u2019s innovative culture, short\u2026shorter development timelines, and a burgeoning array of commercial space solutions to the greatest extent possible.Simplify that to say if industry doesn\u2019t understand our challenges, they cannot contribute and if we do not understand what industry can bring to bear, we miss opportunities.The second Line of Effort is Operational and Technical Integration.In this line of effort, we will work the details of integrating commercial space solutions into a hybrid space architecture.This line of effort includes developing the policies, processes, technical standards, procedures that allow the commercial sector to integrate data and hardware with the Space Force\u2026 and it will require unity of effort between the Space Force and the Joint Force when conducting missions involving employment of hybrid architectures.In this portion of the strategy, we describe and prioritize the mission areas where we see the best opportunity for industry to assist the Space Force.The third line of effort is Risk Management.The integration of commercial space solutions into the Space Force architecture is not without risk.Being a part of a hybrid space architecture means being a part of a mission from competition through crisis and conflict.Ensuring that our architectures can meet the demands of each of these conditions will be essential to effective performance.The Space Force will work to ensure that all stakeholders understand risks and receive actionable, timely data to aid in risk mitigation. But this must be a collective effort by all partners.The fourth and final line of effort is about Securing the Future.In this line of effort, the Space Force will continue to seek out emerging technologies in the commercial space sector that have the potential to support the Joint and Combined Force today and in the future.The Space Force will prioritize our Science and Technology efforts that are tailored to the operational environment and optimized for fielding capabilities on operationally relevant timelines.We must continuously assess the future operating environment.What missions will need to perform, what threats will we face, and what technologies can we bring to bear to meet our operational challenges?We know we will need substantial support from the space industry to answer these vital questions.Now as we work these lines of effort, we will have to make tough choices about where to place our precious resources.As we all understand, there is never enough money to go around so we will prioritize and scrutinize our investments.We are in an era of constrained resources, and we are going to have to make trades between what we buy and what we build.Therefore, we are challenging the team to identify how best to optimize our resources as we work to deliver space capabilities needed by the Joint Force.To help industry understand our thinking, the Commercial Space Strategy outlines four broad assessment criteria that will used to evaluate proposals.The first is Operational Utility.This is the ability for a capability to satisfy a needed requirement for Space Force operations in support of a joint or combined campaign.We are not just buying things because we can \u2013 we will be contracting for capabilities that directly enable us to satisfy Service or Joint requirements and are clearly traceable to those requirements.The second principle is Feasibility, and this refers to the cost to acquire and exploit the capability at sufficient value and at a cost that the Space Force is prepared to resource. For example, evaluating the feasibility of purchasing time on a commercial ground architecture for Telemetry, Tracking, and Commanding versus buying new antennas for the Satellite Control Network or evaluating the feasibility of on-orbit refueling or servicing operations for Space Force missions.Our third criteria, Resilience by Design, centers around the capability\u2019s ability to contribute to resilience and secure an enduring competitive advantage.Commercial space capabilities enhance our capacity and resiliency but only if they contribute to defense in-depth.If commercial capabilities place a \u201cprotect and defend\u201d tax on the Space Force they may not be as valuable as those that are able to protect themselves or operate effectively under contested circumstances.Proliferated architectures, disaggregated missions, and cyber defense capabilities help to increase our resilience and decrease the risk to the Joint Force.And the final assessment criteria is Speed to Fielding.Time matters because we are running out of it.The timeline from concept to operational capability will be important.We don\u2019t have the luxury of waiting years for programs to deliver \u2013 the speed of need is right now, and we will evaluate commercial capabilities not just on their level of innovation and capability but also on the timeline to get it to the field and available for use by the Joint Force.We believe that understanding the guiding principles, our lines of effort, and the criteria we will use to assess proposals will help our industry partners better understand our needs and how best to meet them.Now as I said at the outset, the Commercial Space Strategy is not a panacea\u2026it does not provide all the answers.But I do think it frames the discussion that must take place, it sets the conditions for productive collaboration, and it starts the critical processes needed to accelerate the Purposeful Pursuit of Hybrid Space Architectures.For those partners interested in helping us fortify our capabilities, a great place to start is with our Commercial Space Office and the Space Force\u2019s Front Door.Drop by their booths this week.And I am looking forward to your feedback and working closely with all of you in this critical endeavor. We need it now and we need it to secure our future.Now speaking of our future\u2026if you will permit me to shift gears. I\u2019d like to finish up this morning by talking about my favorite subject\u2026Guardians.Another way we are ensuring our future success is by tapping into the talent and innovation of our number one resource, our Guardians.In fact, as part of our commitment to innovation and skills development, the Space Force recently hosted the second annual Guardian Field Forum.And once again, it was an amazing and productive event.The forum brought together a diverse group of relatively junior people, including Officers, Enlisted, and Civilians, to share innovative ideas with the Senior Leaders about training, acquisitions, and operations.We\u2019re still working through the many recommendations from this year\u2019s event\u2026 but I can tell you that last year, this forum yielded a variety of innovative recommendations currently being implemented, to include increasing our training pipeline capacity, outlining better collaboration between analysts and defenders in the Space Force and in US Cyber Command, and the assignment and utilization of Supra Coders.I often say that innovation is a key component of what sets our Guardians apart, and this year\u2019s Guardian Field Forum was another great demonstration of that. Our Guardians never cease to inspire and impress me.As I finish up, I am reminded of the quote from Neil deGrasse Tyson.He says, \u201cWith only rare exceptions, history shows that while strategy and bravery can win a battle, the frontiers of science and technology must be exploited to win a war.\u201dWith China and Russia now challenging our Space Superiority at levels never before seen in the domain, the frontiers of science and technology \u2013 the innovation that can be found in the commercial space sector, innovation that will be talked about in these halls \u2013 will be crucial to our success.At the Guardian Field Forum, our junior Guardians demonstrated to me that they understand we need to do things differently, and they showed me that they are interested in rolling up their sleeves to do the hard work.I think we all understand that the process needed to completely ready ourselves to meet the challenges we face is extensive and requires all hands-on deck.The Commercial Space Strategy is intended to help start that process.This strategy acknowledges that old ways of doing business will not produce the results we need.The Space Force must harness the benefits of technological innovation and emerging capabilities if we are going to be able to outcompete our competitors \u2013 or the Space Force will lose\u2026the Joint Force will lose\u2026and the U.S. will lose!Thank you again to the Space Foundation for allowing me to come out today and spend some time with you talking about our new Commercial Space Strategy.My hope is that today\u2019s conversation adds to the collective spirit of this event in the same way the words of Generals Chilton and Raymond, Admiral Papparo, and Secretary Bob Work, did over the past three decades.I look forward to continuing to partner with each and every one of you\u2026 To Secure our Nation\u2019s Interests In, From, and To Space!Thank you, and Semper Supra![Applause]",

        "text": "Why big Medicare Advantage insurers may root for Biden to lose in 2024\nInsurance giants have a bigger stake in this year\u2019s presidential election after recent moves by the Biden administration cut into the profitability of Medicare Advantage plans.\n\nIn the last week, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) delivered consecutive blows to the industry that offers these private-sector Medicare alternatives, denting insurance stocks and pulling down estimates of future earnings.\n\nInsurers will get paid less than expected next year for providing these plans, while, at the same time, they must abide by new, and probably costlier, regulations. Other key changes rolling out over the next three years could also nick their bottom lines.\n\nThe industry expects a second term for President Joe Biden would bring more of the same at a time when the youngest baby boomers become Medicare-eligible and more of the older ones seek healthcare services.\n\n\"Do I want to say it's a historic level of regulations? If it's not, it's got to be close to it,\" Whit Mayo, an analyst with Leerink Partners, told Yahoo Finance. \"Biden is no friend to the industry right now.\"\n\nThis Nov. 8, 2018 file photo shows a page from the 2019 U.S. Medicare Handbook in Washington. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n'A major change'\n\nThe new regulations have come hard and fast recently.\n\nLast week, the government said it would increase its payments to Medicare Advantage (MA) insurers by 3.7% in 2025. That\u2019s \"marginally worse\" than the earlier proposed rate, Mayo said, and \u201cinconsistent with almost any historic precedent.\u201d\n\nIt also caught the industry by surprise because many expected CMS to incorporate the uptick in healthcare service volumes in the fourth quarter.\n\nA few days later, CMS finalized other rules around health equity, behavioral healthcare services, and supplemental benefits that would require more action from insurers.\n\nThe agency also established new rules on how much insurers can compensate a broker selling Medicare Advantage plans to ensure seniors are steered into plans that best meet their needs \u2014 not into ones that are most profitable.\n\n\u201cCMS does not want an agent to have preference over any plan based on commissions\u2026so this is a major change,\u201d Mayo said.\n\nIn this June 8, 2015, file photo specialist Anthony Rinaldi works adjacent to the post that handles Humana, on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nThese efforts are weighing down insurer stocks.\n\nYear to date, shares of Humana (HUM) \u2014 which has the largest exposure with MA accounts making up 77% of its total revenue \u2014 are down 30%.\n\nThe stock of UnitedHealthcare (UNH) has declined nearly 13% since the beginning of the year. MA accounts make up 31% of UnitedHealthcare's total revenue, according to Ann Hynes, managing director at Mizuho Americas.\n\nIn a note last week to investors, Hynes estimated the 3.7% increase in the MA payment rate could be a 2% and 4% \"headwind\" for UnitedHealthcare\u2019s 2025 earnings, a 2% to 6% drag on both CVS Healthcare Corp.\u2019s (CVS) and Centene Corp.\u2019s (CNC) profits, and an 8% anchor on Humana\u2019s bottom line.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOne of the three \"key upcoming catalysts\" for Humana\u2019s stock, Hynes wrote, is \u201cthe 2024 Presidential election.\u201d On the horizon More change is on its way under the Biden administration\u2019s CMS that could also upend insurance profits. The agency recently put out a new patient risk coding model. Each patient receives a risk score based on the number and severity of their health conditions. The unhealthier the patient, the higher the risk score and the more money CMS pays to insurers. Under the new model, risk scores will overall likely decline, meaning fewer dollars will flow to insurers. How much exactly? The model, which will be fully phased in 2025, is expected to save Medicare $11 billion this year, per CMS estimates. Next year, it will likely be more. How Medicare Advantage plans are rated by CMS is also changing. CMS ranks each plan annually using a one-to-five-star scale, with five being the best, based on a variety of metrics. The idea is to reward plans that provide quality care with reimbursement and bonuses while cracking down on mediocre plans by reducing CMS payments and restricting their marketing. Over the next three years, CMS plans to increase or decrease the weighting of some measures, eliminate others, and add a health equity index to the ranking. Insurers work hard to maintain at least a four-star rating on their plans to get a 5% quality bonus, which, by law, must be invested into plan benefits. \"That's what gives you a competitive advantage in the market,\" Mayo said. Insurers also remain under pressure from increasingly vocal healthcare providers, which are dropping some Medicare Advantage plans due to too many denials, delays, and refusals to pay for care that Original Medicare would usually cover. October surprise, anyone? Under Donald Trump, those changes may not be carried out. \"I think the perception among the investment community is that, under a Trump administration, the environment would be more favorable,\u201d Mayo said. \u201cJust not as much regulation, maybe even roll back.\" It may be seniors \u2014 historically one of the most reliable voting blocs \u2014 who may get the last word. Mayo expects insurers will readjust some of the MA benefits so they can grow \u2014 or at least hold \u2014 their margins in light of the recent changes, a reversal of the years-long cycle of \"massive\" investment in these perks.

Seniors will see those reductions in benefits or increases in co-insurance during Medicare\u2019s annual open enrollment period, when they choose their health insurance for next year. Open enrollment kicks off Oct. 15, less than a month before the presidential election on Nov. 5. That means the 33 million Americans now enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans, making up over half of Medicare-eligible adults, may get mad after their plan drops benefits that enticed them to sign up in the first place. They may carry that anger into the voting booth. That may be what insurers are hoping for. Janna Herron is a Senior Columnist at Yahoo Finance. Follow her on Twitter @JannaHerron.

On April 11 (US Eastern time), President Biden, Prime Minister Kishida, and President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. of the Philippines met in a trilateral summit, after which they issued a Joint Vision Statement affirming \"the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait as an indispensable element of global security and prosperity.\" Presidential Office Spokesperson Olivia Lin (\u6797\u807f\u79aa), on April 12, stated that Taiwan is pleased to see that the US, Japan, and the Philippines have taken a firm stance on maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, and that we thank the US and Japan for recognizing Taiwan's contribution to peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nSpokesperson Lin stated that the expansion of authoritarianism has posed serious challenges to regional security and the international order. She said that the joint statements issued following the US-Japan summit and the US-Japan-Philippines summit underscore the fact that there is a strong international consensus on the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. The spokesperson emphasized that Taiwan, as a responsible member of the international community, is capable and willing to work together with the international community, and will continue strengthening its self-defense capabilities to work alongside like-minded countries to uphold a rules-based international order. She added that we will also cooperate to ensure peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and a free and open Indo-Pacific region, contributing to global peace, stability, and prosperity. Taiwan, she said, will continue to act as a force for good in the world.",

        "text": "Looking back at the day FDR died\nOn April 12, 1945, the 32nd president of the United States, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, died in Georgia. Harry Truman along with an entire nation was stunned by Roosevelt\u2019s unexpected passing.\n\nThe President had gone to Warm Springs, Georgia, on doctor\u2019s advice on March 29, 1945, to recover from what was believed to be exhaustion. Around 1:15 p.m., Roosevelt collapsed in a chair as he sat for a portrait painting as he complained of a terrific headache. Within two hours, he was pronounced dead at the age of 63.\n\nAudio: Radio announcements of FDR's death\n\nTruman, in particular, had little contact with Roosevelt since becoming FDR\u2019s third Vice President in January 1945. Nine months earlier, the former Senator from Missouri had been a compromise choice among Democratic leaders to replace Roosevelt\u2019s second Vice President, Henry Wallace.\n\nIn the run-up to the July 1944 convention in Chicago, James Byrnes, William O. Douglas, and Truman were considered for a Vice Presidential slot that Wallace wouldn\u2019t surrender without a floor vote. Party leaders knew the pick was crucial because of Roosevelt\u2019s apparent declining health. Truman was acceptable as a choice for pro-union and conservative Democrats.\n\nHowever, Truman was reluctant to accept until Roosevelt insisted. Truman was approved on the second ballot, but only after considerable efforts were made convincing Wallace supporters to switch candidates.\n\nTruman had spent his time as Vice President in his constitutional role of presiding over the Senate, and on that day, he was having drinks with his friend, Sam Rayburn, after the Senate had finished its business. A call came from the White House to go immediately to its Pennsylvania Avenue entrance. Truman was met by Eleanor Roosevelt and told the President had died. When Truman asked what he could do for Mrs. Roosevelt, she replied, \u201cIs there anything we can do for you? You are the one in trouble now.\u201d\n\nWithin minutes, the White House press agency sent out an official bulletin at 5:47 p.m., that President Roosevelt had died two hours earlier from a cerebral stroke. Chief Justice Harlan Stone was then called to the White House to issue Truman\u2019s presidential oath of office in the Cabinet Room in front of Bess Truman, Rayburn, and several Cabinet members.\n\nWithin 15 minutes of the press office\u2019s death notification, all major American radio networks had issued bulletins, and they stopped their regular programming. News reports were mixed with solemn music, and interviews with shocked citizens.\n\nAt 7 p.m., Truman convened his first Cabinet meeting, which was a short session. But after the meeting, War Secretary Henry Stimson pulled President Truman aside to tell him about a secret project about a \u201cnew explosive of almost unbelievable destructive power.\u201d Two weeks later, Truman would be fully briefed on the Manhattan Project and the United States atomic program.\n\nOne hour later, the White House issued a brief statement from President Truman. \"The world may be sure that we will prosecute this war on both fronts, east and west, with all the vigor we possess, to a successful conclusion,\" Truman said. The White House also said that a conference in San Francisco to organize the United Nations would go on as scheduled.\n\nIn his diary that night, Truman noted that he had not been included in any of the previous President\u2019s planning during the war. \u201cI was not familiar with any of these things, and it was something to think about, but I decided the best thing to do was to go home and get as much rest as possible and face the music,\u201d he wrote.\n\nEleanor Roosevelt had flown down on a military plane to Fort Benning in Georgia, to work on the funeral arrangements for the late President Roosevelt. She arrived at Warm Springs at 11:30 p.m., and spent the night making plans with other Roosevelt family members.\n\nIn a late edition, the New York Times noted the gravity and importance of the day\u2019s events. \u201cThe impact of the news of the President's death on the capital was tremendous. Although rumor and a marked change in Mr. Roosevelt's appearance and manner had brought anxiety to many regarding his health, and there had been increasing speculation as to the effects his death would have on the national and world situation, the fact stunned the Government and the citizens of the capital,\u201d it reported.\n\n\u201cThe constitutional transition to the Presidency of Mr. Truman was accomplished without a visible sign of anxiety or fear on the part of any of those responsible for waging war and negotiating peace under the Chief Executive.\u201d",

Some government staff will also attend.\n\nKinew said Friday he'd meet with politicians from both sides of the aisle, as well as \"thought leaders\" and \"folks who are influential around public policy\" in the U.S.\n\n\"I think the most important goal that I would hope we accomplish on this is that we just start to build the relationships. We build the relationships so that if we need to go to the negotiating table later, the interests of Manitoba are going to be well understood and we'll be able to stand up for our jobs and our economy.\"\n\nTwo sides of the aisle\n\nAccording to an itinerary provided to CBC News, the premier's three days in Washington will consist of several meetings with U.S. Congress members and senators. Kinew's office wouldn't reveal the names of the lawmakers, but said they represent Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota and Alaska.\n\nKinew will also have discussions with senior U.S. agriculture official Alexis Taylor, Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem, as well as officials with the National Association of Manufacturers, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Washington International Trade Association and American Federation of Labor.\n\nWATCH | Kinew to lead 1st international trade mission as premier:\n\nManitoba Premier Wab Kinew ready to embark on U.S. trade mission Duration 2:06 Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew is visiting the United States for his first international trade mission as premier. He says it's important to deepen economic ties with the U.S., even as the upcoming presidential election leads to uncertainty about America's future policies around trade.\n\nManitoba will host a kickoff breakfast on Monday morning and a reception at the Canadian Embassy on Tuesday evening.\n\nThe entire delegation will receive a tour of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum on Monday.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the premier will deliver a speech at a \"breakfast conversation\" co-hosted by the Wilson Center and Canadian American Business Council.\n\nKinew will arrive in New York late Wednesday and on Thursday meet with representatives from CIBC, credit rating companies S&P Global Ratings and Moody's Investor Services, and the Canadian ambassador to the United States.\n\nHe'll return to Winnipeg later that day.\n\nLeaders of Manitoba's business, manufacturing, mining, agriculture and labour sectors are part of the province's delegation to the United States. (Darren Bernhardt/CBC)\n\nIn a statement, the government said Kinew would use the meetings to \"leverage a heightened focus on the clean energy economy, food security and strategic trade corridors to underline existing agreements and find new opportunities to export goods and services to the United States.\"\n\nOfficial Opposition Leader Wayne Ewasko said Manitobans are struggling at home with long health-care waits and other issues.\n\n\"The premier has plenty of time for his junkets when he's not scheduled to be in the legislature answering the questions of Manitobans,\" the Progressive Conservative leader said in a statement.\n\nKinew will miss four days of question period due to his absence.\n\nThe government wouldn't answer Friday how much the four-day trade mission will cost the province.\n\nOther recent government business trips to the United States include former PC premier Brian Pallister visiting New York in 2018 to sell banks on the province's improving fiscal situation, and in 2014 former NDP premier Greg Selinger visited New York and Atlanta on trade missions.\n\nMembers of Kinew's trade mission delegation:",

        "text": "Election 2024: The United States Is Facing a Second China Shock\nIs history repeating itself?\n\nThe Chinese economic miracle of the early 2000s rode on the back of exports. As China became the world\u2019s manufacturer, many of its products headed to the United States. American consumers got cheaper goods and lower inflation. But those benefits came at a price. Thousands of U.S. firms, especially in the industrial Midwest, couldn\u2019t keep up. They went out of business, and their employees lost their jobs.\n\nEconomists refer to that time as the China shock. Most also thought it was a one-off, an era not to be repeated. China\u2019s currency appreciated, its labor costs rose, its growth became more dependent on domestic investment, and U.S. firms and policy adapted.\n\nThe Water's Edge James M.

The country\u2019s growth prospects suddenly dimmed. Talk of China overtaking the United States as the world\u2019s largest economy gave way to talk about how China was bogged down in the so-called middle-income trap.\n\nTo restart its growth engine, China could have done what most economists recommended, spur domestic consumption. China instead returned to the strategy that drove its meteoric rise: exports. Beijing is now heavily subsidizing domestic firms. They have responded. But they are producing more goods than the Chinese market can absorb. The surplus, and there is a lot of it, is headed overseas.\n\nThat is a problem. As U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen put it while in Beijing last weekend, \u201cWhen the global market is flooded by artificially cheap Chinese products, the viability of American and other foreign firms is put into question.\u201d\n\nThe last part of Yellen\u2019s statement merits emphasis. The problem isn\u2019t America\u2019s alone. Complaints that China is trying to solve its economic problems at the expense of others can be heard in Berlin, Brasilia, Delhi, London, Mexico City, and Paris among other capitals. Some of these complaints target China\u2019s policies in traditional industrial sectors. Brazil has pointed to the damage cheap Chinese exports are doing to Brazilian producers of chemicals, metal sheeting, and tires. Chile faces a potentially existential threat to its steel industry.\n\nMany of the complaints, however, increasingly target China\u2019s massive subsidies for green energy. As Axios put it earlier this week, \u201cthere is a rising, worldwide backlash against cheap green tech.\u201d So many cheap Chinese solar panels have flooded the European market that they are being used to build garden fences. Carmakers across the world fret that imports of cheap Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) will cripple their businesses.\n\nAt a conference I attended today, Reuters commentator Hugo Dixon called this the \u201cgood, green glut.\u201d In a way, it is. Speeding up the world\u2019s transition to green energy should slow down climate change. But countries aren\u2019t going to sit idly by as domestic industries and jobs are demolished.\n\nAnd they haven\u2019t. Yellen has warned that the United States, which has had tariffs on Chinese solar panels since the Obama administration, \u201cwon\u2019t rule out\u201d protecting its clear energy industry. The European Union has opened an investigation into China\u2019s subsidies of EVs and adopted a foreign subsidies regulation that blocks companies subsidized by foreign governments from bidding on EU procurement projects. Brazil and India have launched similar efforts, even if they are, like China, members of BRICS.\n\nThe increased concern over Chinese exports adds an additional tension to a strained U.S.-Chinese relationship already buffeted by differences over Israel, Taiwan, and Ukraine. All signs so far are that Beijing is brushing off Yellen\u2019s message, noting among other things how the Biden administration is subsidizing U.S. green energy investments with the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nBut it would be a mistake to focus solely on the dialogue between Beijing and Washington. The Biden administration, and a second Trump administration if it comes to be, will need to pay attention to what it friends, partners, and allies are doing, as well as to how its own policy choices affect them. Coordinated, or at least aligned, policies would be the most likely to persuade Beijing to turn back from its effort to export its problems abroad.\n\nThe risk is that we will get uncoordinated efforts that produce recriminations and retaliation among countries that otherwise share common objectives. That could produce trade and currency wars that make a second China Shock even more consequential than the first.\n\nCampaign Update\n\nThe secretary of state\u2019s offices in Alabama and Ohio have informed the Democratic Party that Joe Biden might not be on either state\u2019s ballot in November. The problem is that Alabama state law requires political parties to certify their presidential and vice-presidential candidates eighty-two days before Election Day, which makes this year\u2019s deadline August 15. Ohio state law requires the certification ninety days in advance, or August 7 in this electoral cycle. The Democratic National Convention opens on August 19. The Alabama and Ohio laws have been a problem before. Both state legislatures exempted the Republican Party in 2020 because its convention opened after the deadline passed. The Ohio state legislature also exempted the Democrats four years ago for the same reason. Democrats are hoping for similar treatment this year. Biden is expected to lose both Alabama and Ohio in 2024, as he did four years ago. So not making the ballot, if it should come to that, wouldn\u2019t doom his overall electoral prospects. It would, however, hurt down-ballot Democrats by depressing Democratic turnout.\n\nThird-party candidate Cornel West named Melina Abdullah to be his running mate. Abdullah is a professor of Pan-African Studies at California State University, Los Angeles, and one of the founders of the Black Lives Matter movement. She has never run for political office before. In naming Abdullah, West said: \u201cI wanted to run with someone who would put a smile on the face of Fannie Lou Hamer and Martin Luther King Jr. from the grave.\u201d An immediate challenge for the West-Abdullah ticket is getting on more state ballots. So far they have qualified in just three states.\n\nThe Candidates in Their Own Words\n\nBiden criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in an interview with Univision on Tuesday night, saying, \u201cI think what he\u2019s doing is a mistake.\u201d\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Biden Univision Video Pause Video Pause Biden Univision Embed\n\nBiden said nothing, however, about pressuring Netanyahu to change course in Gaza. The Israeli prime minister will likely watch what Biden does while discounting what he says.\n\nOn Wednesday, Donald Trump repeated his criticism of Jewish Americans who vote for Biden. The former president told reporters that \u201cany Jewish person that votes for a Democrat or votes for Biden should have their head examined.\u201d\n\nTrump similarly repeated his criticisms of migrants seeking to cross the U.S. border. He told guests at a record-setting fundraiser on Saturday night: \u201cThese are people coming in from prisons and jails. They\u2019re coming in from just unbelievable places and countries, countries that are a disaster.\u201d He went on to recall the criticisms he received in 2018 for saying that migrants coming from Africa, Central America, and Haiti came from \u201c(expletive) countries.\u201d\n\nAnd when I said, you know, \u2018Why can\u2019t we allow people to come in from nice countries, I\u2019m trying to be nice... Nice countries, you know like Denmark, Switzerland? Do we have any people coming in from Denmark? How about Switzerland? How about Norway?\u2019... [T]hey took that as a very terrible comment, but I felt it was fine.\n\nTrump went on to say that migrants were also coming from Yemen, \u201cwhere they\u2019re blowing each other up all over the place.\u201d\n\nWhat the Pundits Are Saying\n\nThe Washington Post reported on what it called \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s secret, long-shot plan to end the war in Ukraine.\u201d The thrust of the plan is that Trump would push \u201cUkraine to cede Crimea and the Donbas border region to Russia.\u201d The plan appears to rest two debatable assumptions: that both Ukraine and Russia want the war to end and that Russian President Vladimir Putin would be satisfied with the territory he has seized thus far. For its part, the Trump campaign told the Post that \u201cany speculation about President Trump\u2019s plan is coming from unnamed and uninformed sources who have no idea what is going on or what will happen.\u201d\n\nThe Financial Times reported this week that oil markets are likely to tighten in the second half of 2024, which would mean higher gas prices are on the way. That would be bad news for the Biden campaign, especially given that inflation was slightly higher than expected in March.\n\nWhat the Polls Show\n\nA Gallup poll released today found a significant rise in the percentage of Americans saying the United States is not doing enough in Ukraine. When Gallup asked last fall, one in four Americans said the United States wasn\u2019t doing enough to help Ukraine. The most recent poll saw that number rise to 36 percent. Conversely, the percentage of Americans thinking that United States is doing too much fell from 41 percent to 36 percent. The changing numbers largely reflect Democrats deciding that Washington is falling down in its support for Kyiv. So the new polling numbers aren't going to break the logjam on Capitol Hill over the Ukraine funding bill.\n\nAge is a major differentiator in how Americans see the war between Israel and Hamas, according to a recent Pew Research Center report. Thirty-three percent of American adults under the age of twenty-nine say that their sympathies lie with the Palestinians, with just 14 percent saying their sympathies lie with Israel. In comparison, only 9 percent of Americans over the age of sixty-five say their sympathies lie with the Palestinians, while 47 percent say their sympathies lie with Israel. That discrepancy points to the political problem that Biden faces. Young voters helped put him over the top in 2020. Given how close he came to losing the Electoral College in that race despite running away with the popular vote, a significant erosion in the youth vote could cost him reelection.\n\nThe Axios-Ipsos Latino Poll found that Latino Americans nationally aren\u2019t keen on Biden (41 percent favorable) or Trump (56 percent). Twenty-eight percent said that immigration is the issue they find most worrying. Sixty-four percent believe the president should have the authority to close the U.S. border to prevent too many immigrants from entering. Forty-two percent favor building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. That is up eight percentage points from December 2021. Thirty-eight percent endorsed returning undocumented immigrants to their country of origin. That is up ten points compared to December 2021.\n\nThe Campaign Schedule\n\nTrump\u2019s criminal trial in New York state court for falsifying business records to hide his relationship with Stormy Daniels is set to begin on Monday (April 15, 2024).\n\nThe oral arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court on Trump\u2019s claim that he has blanket immunity for all his actions while president are set to begin in thirteen days (April 25, 2024).\n\nThe Republican National Convention opens in Milwaukee in ninety-four days (July 15, 2024).\n\nThe Democratic National Convention opens in Chicago in 129 days (August 19, 2024).\n\nElection Day is 207 days away.\n\nInauguration Day is 283 days away.\n\nSinet Adous assisted in the preparation of this post.",

Registering to vote and requesting your absentee ballot for the 2024 elections\n\n\u27a1 The first step is to request your ballot, and if need be, register to vote from abroad. You should do this every election year to ensure you remain on your voting state\u2019s overseas voter rolls and to ensure your local election office has your up-to-date contact information. It\u2019s important to register as an absentee voter from abroad because the ballots of U.S. citizens voting from abroad have special protections and are different from the standard absentee ballot.\n\nGo to votefromabroad.org to fill out your Federal Post Card Application (FPCA) absentee ballot request \u2014 it takes 5-10 minutes! If you're not registered to vote, the FPCA also serves as a voter registration form. Choose the option to receive ballots by email.\n\n\u27a1 The second step is to submit the FPCA absentee ballot request form to your local election office in the United States. Most states allow you to submit your FPCA directly from votefromabroad.org without the need to print it out. But some states require that you submit your completed form by email attachment, fax, or postal mail. State deadlines and submission methods can be found here.\n\nIf you have any questions while filling out your request form, go to the Vote from Abroad FAQ section or type your question in the website's chatbox (red circle in the bottom right-hand corner of each screen). Or you can email us at [email protected].\n\nWatch a video on how to use www.votefromabroad.org.\n\n2. Confirming your request has been accepted \u2705\n\nAfter submitting your FPCA absentee ballot request form, call or email your Local Election Official (LEO) to confirm they have received it and will be sending your ballot. Your LEO's contact information is listed in the instructions generated when you fill out your FPCA form at Vote from Abroad. You can also look up their contact info here.\n\nMost states provide a website where you can verify your voter status. To find your state's website, click here, enter your state, and scroll down to \u201cWhere Is My Ballot?\"\n\n3. Receiving your ballot \ud83d\udcec\n\nYour overseas absentee ballot is not your standard absentee ballot back home! Thanks to the MOVE Act, all states must send FPCA-requested absentee ballots to overseas voters no later than 45 days before a federal election \u2014 this year that\u2019s September 21, 2024.\n\nAnd, if requested, all states must send overseas voters their absentee ballots by email or other electronic means.\n\nYou don't need to wait for ballots to arrive on September 21. If you're worried your ballot won't arrive on time, send in a Backup Ballot NOW. The Backup Ballot (Federal Write-in Absentee Ballot or FWAB) is specifically for overseas voters who are concerned they won't receive their official ballot in time to return it by the deadline. All details about the Backup Ballot can be found here.\n\n4. Your ballot hasn\u2019t arrived? \ud83d\udced\n\nCheck your spam or promotions folder. Still no ballot? Contact your local election official here and confirm they\u2019ve sent your ballot to you. Go to votefromabroad.org if you need to send in a new FPCA absentee ballot request form.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t received your ballot by October 1 and your state requires postal mail return, we recommend you send in a Backup Ballot to make sure your vote gets to your state in time. All details about the Backup Ballot can be found here.\n\n5.

You can also download a free U.S. postage-paid return envelope template at FVAP.gov. Address the envelope to your local election official.\n\nPlease be aware that using the diplomatic pouch does not mean your ballot will arrive faster.

        "text": "Final Common Ground Examines Hot Topics for Presidential Election\nThe event, titled \u201cThe State of the Race: Biden v. Trump and the Road to the White House,\u201d featured John Feehery, a partner of EFB Advocacy, a lobbying and strategic advocacy firm, and Aleigha Cavalier, the vice president of mobilization and campaign management at Precision, an integrated strategy and marketing agency that works to change people\u2019s minds and move them to action. Steve Scully, the senior vice president of communications at the Bipartisan Policy Center (BPC), moderated the discussion.\n\nJohn Feehery and Aleigha Cavalier chat with students in the American Political Process class. Photo: Nancy L. Ford\n\nThe debate opened and closed with abortion. Feehery stated that \u201cabortion is the Achilles heel of the Republican Party, and he noted that a candidate needs two pieces of the same puzzle to win the electoral college: people who agree with you and people to vote for you. According to Feehery, abortion fulfills the latter, and that can be a good or bad thing depending on a politician's position. Both strategists were well aware of this, reflecting the omnipresent nature of abortion within the minds of Democratic and Republican strategists alike. Cavalier noted the importance of reproductive rights and her belief that this issue would create huge turnout for Democrats. It seemed to both speakers that abortion was the largest weakness of the Republican party and the greatest strength of the Democratic party.\n\nWhen asked to speak on abortion, Feehery declined to do so, stating \u201cI have my opinions and she has hers. Both are strong and will not change.\u201d The audience\u2019s reaction to this was hushed \u2013 Cavalier\u2019s was not. She and the moderator both agreed this is the exact purpose of Common Ground, though they did move on from the disagreement. Through my work with Common Ground and in my life, I have realized how prevalent this kind of logic is, especially when it comes to polarizing topics. This is why the entire premise of Common Ground \u2013 to have the hard conversations and then find the path forward \u2013 is so important.\n\nThis is why the entire premise of Common Ground \u2013 to have the hard conversations and then find the path forward \u2013 is so important.\n\nFeehery made clear that he believes the central issue of the election is the economy. If the economy was doing well, Biden would have the advantage; if not, Trump would. Feehery said he believes that this is the central reason why Trump won the 2016 election. \u201cHe [Trump] spoke to the economic insecurities and general insecurities\u201d of Midwesterners. Cavalier nodded and suggested that a key strength of Trump was his ability to connect with his citizens.\n\nCommon Ground Common Ground will return in fall 2024 to tackle climate change, congressional differences, and more. Common Ground Events\n\nEach Common Ground event ends with a Q&A period open to all attendees. Among the first to speak was a staff member who spoke honestly of his home, family, and voting habits. He spoke up to share his frustration with the Democratic party for forgetting people like him. The speakers responded clearly and compassionately, especially Cavalier. She noted their common origins \u2013 a small Rust Belt town with a bust of JFK on the mantle and deep democratic values \u2013 and spoke of how a future path for the Democratic party lies in recovering the loyalty and support of individuals like himself and his family, who boast a combined 150 years of union membership.\n\nThis question prompted the kind of discussion I always hoped to be a part of when I joined Common Ground as an ambassador. I am eager to hear and learn from others\u2019 lives and viewpoints. This moment, while inherently political, was an honest demonstration of the ways that identity and lived experience builds political identity, and not the other way around.\n\nIt is my hope for Common Ground that this initiative will continue evolving to reflect this essential truth. I believe that this is one of the few paths my organization can take to embody our high ideal: facilitating respectful and civil discourse with those that do not share your identity or worldview.",

        "text": "Trump New York hush-money trial is far from a slam dunk\nTrump New York hush-money trial is far from a slam dunk\n\nBBC\n\nDonald Trump's very first criminal trial - and the first of a former US president - involves charges of white-collar crime, but it features some of the most eye-catching details in any of the four criminal cases against him. The case revolves around a $130,000 (\u00a3104,000) hush-money payment from Mr Trump's lawyer to adult-film actress Stormy Daniels, who claims she had an affair with Trump in 2006. But that payment was not actually illegal. Instead, the blockbuster case bringing 34 felony charges is based on allegations the former president falsified business records to cover up the payment - made just before the 2016 election - to avoid an embarrassing sex scandal which he denies. The trial, which began in New York on 15 April, has legal experts divided on the strength of the case. Some debate whether Manhattan's District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, should have even brought the case and whether it is strong enough.\n\nAmbrosio Rodriguez, a former prosecutor who says he is no fan of the former president, believes the case legitimises Mr Trump's ongoing argument that he is being prosecuted unfairly because of who he is. Mr Rodriguez argues that the case relies on old allegations, noting that federal prosecutors had investigated and declined to bring charges. \"This is a waste of time and a bad idea, and not good for the country,\" he told the BBC. \"This seems just a political need and want to get Trump no matter what the costs are.\" Others disagree. Nick Akerman, who worked on the Watergate prosecution, says it's a serious case.\n\nWatch: Our New York correspondent sets out what's at stake in Trump's unprecedented trial?\n\n\"This is about an effort to defraud the American voters in 2016 to keep them from learning material information that would have affected their vote,\" he told the BBC, referring to Mr Trump's alleged efforts to hide payments reimbursing his then lawyer, Michael Cohen.\n\nA novel legal approach\n\nThe case also has come under scrutiny because it's seemingly built on an untested legal theory. Mr Trump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. New York prosecutors say Mr Cohen paid off Ms Daniels, and accuse Mr Trump of trying to disguise the money he paid him back as legal fees. Ordinarily, falsifying business records is considered a misdemeanour - or low-level offence - in New York. But when it is done to conceal a crime, it can be elevated to a more serious felony charge. It is not unusual for the Manhattan District Attorney's Office to do that, but Mr Bragg's approach is a particularly novel one.\n\nBloomberg Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg\n\nHe says Trump Organization records were falsified to conceal or aid criminal activity. But even though the trial begins on Monday, he has not specified the exact crime allegedly hidden. He has however given clues. In court filings and interviews, Mr Bragg has said Mr Trump violated both state and federal election laws, and state tax laws. \"The District Attorney's office is not precluded from presenting to the jury a variety of alternative theories on sort of why the records were falsified,\" says Shane T. Stansbury, a former assistant United States Attorney in New York's southern district. But he adds that it is unclear if a state prosecutor can invoke a federal election crime, as it appears Mr Bragg intends to do. \"We could have appellate courts and even the US Supreme Court weighing in on some of the federal questions that are part of this theory, so I think we're a long way from having resolution on this case,\" he says. A former prosecutor in the New York federal office, Mark Pomerantz, said federal prosecutors went back and forth on charging Mr Trump so often that the investigation was nicknamed \"the zombie case\". But due to the seriousness of charging a former president, some legal experts say that Mr Bragg had to bring the strongest possible case against Mr Trump, which is why he went for felony charges. \"Given who the defendant is in this case,\" said Anna Cominsky, a professor at the New York Law School, \"Just a misdemeanour may not rise to the level of criminality that perhaps one would expect someone in Trump's position to be charged with.\"\n\nA wildcard witness\n\nOne of the biggest wildcards in this case is the prosecution's star witness: Michael Cohen. Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to federal campaign violations as part of the alleged cover-up, which he said was directed by Mr Trump. Since his release, he has become one of Mr Trump's harshest critics, consistently attacking him in the press and on his podcast. He has also admitted in the past to lying to Congress under oath. That history makes him a \"compromised witness,\" said Mr Stansbury. But as the man at the centre of the alleged scheme, he is almost guaranteed to testify against his former boss. \"His credibility is a huge issue for the prosecution, and definitely something the defence is going to attack,\" said Ms Cominsky. Mr Bragg will try to bolster Mr Cohen's testimony by presenting proof of the payments to the jury.\n\nTrump's defence\n\nThe former president is sticking with a strategy that amounts to attack-and-delay. He frequently calls the case a \"hoax\" and a \"witch-hunt.\" He has slammed Judge Merchan and District Attorney Bragg and attacked their family members on social media - to the extent that a partial gag order has now been imposed that prevents him from attacking court staff and their families.\n\nPool/Getty Images Mr Trump speaks to the press after a 25 March hearing in his New York criminal case",

        "text": "Joe Biden v Donald Trump - four things that could decide who wins\nJoe Biden v Donald Trump - four things that could decide who wins\n\nReuters\n\nDonald Trump and Joe Biden will do battle in November to determine who occupies the White House for the next four years.\n\nThis contest will be unique in modern history as a rematch between the current president and his immediate predecessor.\n\nThe contrast will be simple, according to Sean Spicer, who served as Mr Trump's first press secretary and worked for the Republican National Committee prior to that.\n\n\"For those people who say, well, during Trump, the policies of Donald Trump made my life better, more secure, made the economy and our communities better, it's a no brainer.\"\n\nThe Trump campaign will be hoping to distract from the weaknesses of their candidate - his legal troubles, his divisive rhetoric and his attempts to undermine the 2020 election results, which contributed to the January 2021 attack on the US Capitol.\n\nBut Mr Biden also has key vulnerabilities, struggling to sell his first-term achievements and trying to convince the public he has the energy for the campaign and a second term.\n\nHe paints his predecessor as out-of-control and a threat to America, and to democracy itself.\n\n\"Here, you've got somebody who's very well known, and you're just trying to prove he's a big risk.\" says Susan Estrich, a Democratic author and analyst who managed Michael Dukakis' presidential campaign in 1988.\n\nIt's a rematch few Americans say they want but it's a presidential choice that at this point they seem almost certain to get.\n\nHere are four factors that will determine who comes out on top.\n\nClose race on a small map\n\nMr Biden's approval ratings continue to languish in dangerous territory for an incumbent entering an election year. Public perceptions of Mr Trump are also negative, however.\n\nBy all indications, November's general election is going to be tight. National polls show the two candidates either neck and neck or Mr Trump with a slight advantage.\n\nBut this early in the race they are of limited usefulness, given the nature of the US political map. While Americans will head to the polls across the nation, this race will once again be decided in only a handful of states.\n\nGetty Images\n\nThat's because the electoral college, the system the US has to pick its president, depends on candidates winning each state and most states are solidly Democratic or Republican.\n\nThe most crucial states that could go either way this year include Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan in the so-called Rust Belt, and Arizona and Georgia, two states that Mr Biden flipped Democratic in 2020.\n\nNevada is also considered a toss-up but its small population makes it a less valuable prize.\n\nA few states that have been battlegrounds in previous election cycles have slipped off this map - Florida and North Carolina have trended Republican of late, while Virginia and Colorado appear to be more solidly Democratic.\n\nSo while national polls provide fodder for political commentators, a much smaller subset of voters will ultimately be the ones who matter.\n\nPolling showing Mr Trump inching ahead in these key states have caused alarm among some Democrats, but the size of his lead is not statistically significant.\n\nThe economy (again)\n\nWhen it comes down to it, Americans tend to vote from their wallets in national elections - for the governing party in good times and the opposition in bad.\n\n\"It's the economy, stupid\" was the mantra of Bill Clinton's successful 1992 presidential campaign, and the refrain has become political gospel in the decades since.\n\nOne of the factors that makes 2024 challenging to predict is that, on the whole, economic indicators are positive.\n\nIf you're in the UK, sign up here.\n\nAnd if you're anywhere else, sign up here.\n\nThe economy is growing at a steady clip. Unemployment is near record lows. The stock market is hitting record highs. And yet American voters continue to have a grim view of their economic situation.\n\nSome of this can be attributed to several years of high inflation and the continuing high cost of housing in many parts of the US. Home sales in the US have sunk to the lowest levels in nearly 30 years.\n\nAt the Trump victory party in Iowa, two large video screens cycled through graphics showing how rising home mortgage interest rates during the Biden administration have driven up monthly home payments.\n\nThere are some recent signs of hope for Mr Biden, however.\n\nIn March consumer confidence, as measured by a University of Michigan survey, reached its highest level since July 2021. Inflation and gas prices have fallen well below their recent highs. There is still plenty of time for voters to change their minds about the state of the American economy.\n\nGetty Images US consumer confidence is rising again\n\nMr Trump will argue that things were better when he was in office.\n\nAccording to Mr Spicer, the economy - like crime - is a \"gut\" issue and many Americans still don't believe their everyday situation has improved.\n\n\"Until you viscerally feel it,\" he says, \"it doesn't matter what statistic gets thrown at you.\"\n\nMr Biden will counter that the US weathered the post-Covid economic storm better than almost any other country in the world and that Bidenomics - his blend of infrastructure investment, tax cuts and social spending - has improved the lot of working Americans.\n\nAbortion or immigration?\n\nThe Biden campaign will try to convince voters that Mr Trump is responsible for abortion becoming illegal or greatly curtailed in dozens of states, even as the former president has tried to moderate his position on the issue.\n\nEver since the US Supreme Court, with the help of three Trump-appointed justices, discarded a 50-year precedent giving the right to abortion constitutional protections, Democrats have been riding a groundswell of support on the issue to post better-than-expected results at the ballot box.\n\nMr Biden has pointed to state court decisions approving stringent new abortion restrictions in Florida and Arizona, along with upcoming voter referendums on the subject, to encourage liberal voters head to the polls in November. Vice-President Kamala Harris has held rallies across the country focusing on women's reproductive rights.\n\n\"Abortion has turned out to be a much more powerful issue than a lot of people thought it would be,\" Ms Estrich says. \"Everywhere it's been on the ballot, the pro-choice position has won.\"\n\nIf abortion is the electoral issue the Democrats will be trying to elevate in the minds of voters, Mr Trump and the conservatives will be doing the same for immigration.\n\nGetty Images\n\nBorder crossings reached an all-time high in December with 249,785 arrests on the Mexican border - up 31% from November and up 13% from December 2022, the previous record. They have been falling in recent months.\n\nThis massive influx of undocumented migrants and asylum-seekers has at times overwhelmed government processing facilities and strained social service programmes in major cities thousands of miles away.\n\nPolls show that immigration is the top issue for much of Mr Trump's base - and a source of weakness for the president and division among Democrats.\n\nEfforts to address the problem in Congress have proven unsuccessful, in no small part because Mr Trump has been pressuring Republicans to block compromise legislation until after the election.\n\n\"The Biden administration has lost the argument on safety and security at our southern border,\" says Mr Spicer. \"It's over.\"\n\nOther issues might also play a factor in the upcoming presidential race, including US crime rates, the environment and climate change, and foreign policy.\n\nThe Gaza War, in particular, might be an ongoing headache for Mr Biden, as the administration's support for Israel has angered some Democrats, including a larger percentage of the young voters whose turnout in November could decide the election.\n\nKnown unknowns\n\nThe longest general election campaign in recent memory leaves plenty of time for the unpredictable to occur.\n\nGiven the advanced age of both Mr Biden (81) and Mr Trump (77), an incident that calls into question their health and fitness could happen any time.\n\nIn the autumn presidential debates, their energy and composure under pressure will be particularly scrutinised.\n\n\"Age is hurting Biden right now. Everybody thinks Biden is old,\" say Ms Estrich. \"The question is, will Trump show the signs of his age?\"\n\nGiven that polls indicate a majority of Americans are dissatisfied with their two major-party options, the environment is ripe for a third-party or independent candidate to emerge.\n\nRobert Kennedy Jr, the anti-vaccine activist, is polling in double-digits nationally, although he is only on a handful of ballots so far. Left-wing academic Cornel West is also running, and the Libertarian and Green parties will field their own candidates.\n\nGetty Images Robert Kennedy Jr campaigning in Miami\n\nMr Trump's legal headaches could also factor into the race - he faces 91 charges and four criminal trials. Although the indictments seem to have buoyed his standing among Republicans, a criminal conviction may be a different matter.\n\nAccording to an exit poll of voters in the New Hampshire Republican primary, 42% said Mr Trump would not be fit for office if he were found guilty. Polls of voters in other Republican primaries have produced similar results.\n\nAlthough several of Mr Trump's highest-profile trials have been repeatedly delayed, the spectacle of Mr Trump in the defendant's dock and a detailed litigation of his alleged crimes could affect public opinion in a way that the indictments have not.\n\nThe January 2021 attack on the US Capitol by his supporters, with Mr Trump accused of egging them on, has left a scar on the American psyche.\n\nWhile Republican voters appear willing to move past it, Democrats - and, perhaps, the kind of independent voters who will help decide this election - still remember.\n\nThe more they are reminded of that trauma, and the way the first Trump presidency ended - whether by Mr Biden and the Democrats or through courtroom drama - the more the former president's past actions may ultimately come back to haunt him.",

        "text": "Liz Truss backs Donald Trump to win US presidential election\nLiz Truss backs Donald Trump to win US presidential election\n\nFormer PM Liz Truss says she hopes Donald Trump wins the next US election\n\nLiz Truss has endorsed Donald Trump to win this year's US presidential election, saying the \"world was safer\" when he was in the White House.\n\nThe former prime minister said the world was \"on the cusp of very, very serious conflict\" and needed \"a strong America more than ever\".\n\nHer comments came as the first of Mr Trump's four criminal trials began.\n\nMs Truss was speaking ahead of the publication of her book - her account of her time in Number 10.\n\nHer brief stint in power made her the shortest-serving prime minister in Britain's history.\n\nThe former PM, who recently spoke at a pro-Trump conference in the US, said the West's \"opponents feared the Trump presidency more\" than the Democrats under Joe Biden.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC, Ms Truss said Mr Trump was more aggressive towards Iran and China. She also praised Mr Trump's support for Ukraine, approving the sale of anti-tank Javelin missiles, despite his Republican allies' recent attempts to block military aid to the country.\n\n\"I'm not saying that I agree with absolutely everything he's ever said,\" she said.\n\nBut she added: \"I do agree that under Donald Trump when he was president of the United States, the world was safer.\n\n\"I want to work with fellow conservatives to take on what I believe is a real threat of Western society and civilization being undermined by left-wing extreme ideas.\"\n\nThis includes supporting Nigel Farage \"becoming an MP\" if he were to re-join the Conservative party, she told the BBC.\n\nSpeaking to the Newscast podcast, Ms Truss said the founder of the political parties Ukip and Reform UK \"believes in conservative values - I think it's a shame he's not in the Conservative Party\".\n\nEPA Liz Truss gave a speech at the pro-Trump Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), this year.\n\nIn her interview, Ms Truss argued she was forced out of office after 49 days by powerful establishment figures.\n\nMs Truss stood down in October 2022, after Tory MPs revolted against her when a series of U-turns on her economic plan sapped her authority.\n\nShe denied her fall from office was humiliating, saying: \"It was difficult. Absolutely. Was it humiliating? I wouldn't use that word actually.\"\n\nShe said she had gone into the job with the intention of changing things, and hadn't succeeded.\n\nShe added: \"But is that really worse than not trying in the first place? Is it worse than being dishonest and claiming I was going to try and do things and then not do them? Is it worse than being in Number 10 and not doing anything? I don't think so personally, which maybe I think differently from other people.\"\n\nRead more about Liz Truss\n\nEconomic warnings\n\nMs Truss said her and Kwasi Kwarteng's tax-cutting plan to promote growth, was \"undermined by organisations\" like the Bank of England and the Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR).\n\nCivil servants had also failed to warn her \"the UK economy was uniquely exposed\" to so-called Liability Driven Investments (LDIs) - which invest in government bonds because they are usually so stable.\n\nThe Bank of England was forced to start buying back government bonds after these LDIs came close to collapse - which in turn could have forced them to rush to sell other assets.\n\nShe said: \"I have spent many months getting the blame, people saying it's all my fault, people criticising me, trashing me.\n\n\"Yet the Bank of England had a very, very significant role in what happened. The Office of Budget Responsibility had a very significant role in what happened.\n\n\"I haven't seen them get anything like the level of scrutiny or questions that I've got.\"\n\nChallenged on whether she was casting about for someone to blame, she said, \"I'm not saying I'm perfect\", but argued that she didn't have the whole picture when making decisions.\n\nA Bank of England spokesperson said: \"The Bank has already set out its response to the LDI crisis in full, including to Parliament, and has nothing more to add.\"\n\nMs Truss argued for the removal of institutions such as the OBR, and for Andrew Bailey stepping down as the governor of the Bank of England.\n\nDivesting of power from democratically elected officials has left minsters \"impotent\", Ms Truss said, adding: \"Politicians have ended up having responsibility without power, and quangocrats have ended up having power without responsibility and more job security - as I found out.\"\n\nMs Truss's prognosis is a complete overhaul of the political system, including \"abolishing quite a lot of things\".\n\nInternational organisation like the United Nations (UN), which she says no longer has \"a purpose\", are also on the chopping block.\n\n\"The UN Security Council as it's currently constituted with both China and Russia on is not keeping the world safe.\n\n\"At present, it has been very ineffective at dealing with international situations, in fact, positively damaging.\"\n\nAnd she said that the Conservative party was currently split \"between those people like me, who think we need fundamental institutional change in Britain, that our institutions have been captured by leftist ideas\" and others \"not prepared to go that far\".\n\nShe said: \"We need a sufficient number of MPs who understand what the problem is, and are prepared to vote to abolish the quangos.\"",

        "text": "Political activity Dos and Don\u2019ts for Airmen, Guardians, DoD employees\nU.S. Air Force Logo\n\nMilitary personnel and civilian employees are encouraged to carry out their obligations of citizenship, which include the right to participate personally in the political process. These rights are protected by the U.S. Constitution that all military members have taken an oath to support and defend.Because of that oath, service members and civilian employees also have a duty to ensure that their personal activities do not imply official endorsement by the Department of Defense or Department of the Air Force. As individuals, we do not have to be politically neutral, but the Air Force and Space Force do. These rules help to ensure the DoD does not influence or appear to be partisan in our nation's electoral process.Department of Defense Directive 1344.10, Political Activities by Members of the Armed Forces, and individual service regulations outline permitted and prohibited political activities by active duty, Reserve component and retired service members. These rules regulate how and when service members are able to participate in the political process. Service members who violate these directives could face punishment under the Uniform Code of Military Justice and/or other criminal or administrative penalties. The Hatch Act of 1939 (5 U.S.C. 7321-7326) applies to civilian employees and similarly regulates how and when individuals can conduct personal political activities.Service members and federal employees are encouraged to participate in the political process, but they must be careful about not engaging in political activities in the workplace and not using their official positions to advocate for or against political issues. With the directives set forth in DoDD 1344.10 and other regulations in mind, service members should be aware of what they can and cannot do regarding political activities. The below do\u2019s/don\u2019ts are not exhaustive, and service members and employees should consult with their servicing legal office with any questions regarding their personal political activities.Active duty service members CAN:\u00b7 Register to vote, vote and encourage others to vote.\u00b7 Express a personal opinion on political candidates and issues.\u00b7 Write a letter in a newspaper, blog or social media expressing personal political views. However, if you identify yourself as a service member (for example, if you have a photo on your social media of yourself in uniform) you must include a statement that your views do not represent those of the Department of Defense or Department of the Air Force.\u00b7 Attend partisan or non-partisan political rallies and clubs as a spectator during off-duty hours. However, service members (including retirees) may not be in uniform.\u00b7 Serve as a non-partisan election official while off-duty and not in uniform. However, this requires Department Secretary (e.g., Secretary of the Air Force) approval. Contact your servicing Legal Office for more information.\u00b7 Sign petitions for legislative action or to place a candidate's name on the ballot, if done as a private citizen and not as a representative of the armed forces.\u00b7 Donate money to a political party, candidate, organization or committee.\u00b7 Display one non-offensive bumper sticker on your personally owned vehicles.\u00b7 Wear political t-shirts or buttons when not in uniform, performing military duties or when it could give the appearance of DoD or DAF endorsement.Active duty service members CANNOT:\u00b7 Attend a political event (meeting, rally, fundraiser, debate, convention) in uniform, whether it is partisan or nonpartisan.\u00b7 Express personal opinions as if they are service branch or DoD policy.\u00b7 Make derogatory statements about elected officials and DoD/DAF leadership \u2013 a potential UCMJ violation.\u00b7 Organize, lead, sponsor or speak at partisan political events.\u00b7 Engage in partisan political fundraising activities \u2013 except as a donor.\u00b7 Place large political signs on your vehicle (bigger than a bumper sticker).\u00b7 Display any type of political sign, banner, poster or similar device in your office, work area or on-base residence (including privatized housing).\u00b7 Engage in the public or organized recruitment of others to run for political office.\u00b7 Run for political office without Secretary of the Air Force approval.\u00b7 Attempt to influence the view, position or vote of any subordinate.The Hatch Act governs political activities by DoD and other federal civilian employees. The Hatch Act provides restrictions that are similar, but not identical, to those imposed on active duty service members, and restrictions on civilian employees are broken down into \u201cFurther Restricted\u201d and \u201cLess Restricted\u201d categories. Most DAF employees will be \u201cLess Restricted,\u201d meaning, GS-15 and below, and Schedule C employees. Federal civilian employees who violate these rules and restrictions are at risk of disciplinary actions, including reprimand, suspension, removal, debarment from federal employment for up to 5 years, and a $1,000 fine.All federal civilian employees CAN:\u00b7 Register to vote, vote and encourage others to vote.\u00b7 Express a personal opinion on political candidates and issues.\u00b7 Write a letter in a newspaper, blog or social media expressing personal political views.\u00b7 Attend political fundraising functions, rallies and clubs during off-duty hours.\u00b7 Serve as a non-partisan election official.\u00b7 Sign petitions for legislative action or to place a candidate's name on the ballot, if done as a private citizen.\u00b7 Donate money to a political party, organization or committee.\u00b7 Display one non-offensive bumper sticker on your personally owned vehicles.\u00b7 Be candidates for public office in nonpartisan elections in accordance with Office of Personnel Management requirements.\u00b7 Display or wear political signs, stickers, t-shirts or buttons when not on-duty, in a government building or using a government vehicle.All Federal Civilian Employees CANNOT:\u00b7 Use official authority or influence to interfere with or affect an election.\u00b7 Solicit, accept or receive political contributions.\u00b7 Use an official title while participating in political activities.\u00b7 Engage in political activity while: on duty, in a government building or vehicle or wearing an official uniform.\u00b7 Become a candidate in a partisan election.\u00b7 Host or sponsor a political fundraiser (though merely attending one is permitted).Less Restricted Civilians CAN:\u00b7 Volunteer to work for partisan political campaigns\u00b7 Attend and be active (including speaking) at political rallies and meetings\u00b7 Join and hold office in a political party or organization\u00b7 Work the polls on election day for a candidate for partisan political office\u00b7 Assist in partisan voter registration drives (but not in the workplace).\u00b7 Organize and speak at a political fundraiser (but cannot solicit or receive funds).Service members are encouraged to review DoDD 1344.10 and Department of the Air Force Instruction 51-508, Political Activities, Free Speech and Freedom of Assembly to understand permissible political activity.DoD civilian employees are encouraged to visit https://osc.gov/Services/Pages/HatchAct-Federal.aspx for more information on the Hatch Act.All members are encouraged to review the Deputy Secretary of Defense\u2019s 15 February 2024 memorandum on Political activities, available at: https://dodsoco.ogc.osd.mil/Portals/102/Documents/Political%20Activities%20Docs/2024%20DSD%20Memo%20on%20Political%20Activities.pdf The information in this article is provided for informational purposes and is not intended as legal advice.

        "text": "Governor Mills Allows National Popular Vote Legislation to Become Law Without Her Signature\nGovernor Janet Mills announced today that she will allow LD 1578, An Act to Adopt an Interstate Compact to Elect the President of the United States by National Popular Vote, to become law without her signature.\n\nUnder the legislation, Maine joins the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, which would only take effect if the coalition secures pledges for at least 270 electoral votes \u2013 the threshold needed to elect a president. Sixteen states and Washington, D.C. have joined the compact for a total of 205 electoral votes thus far. With Maine, the total of electoral votes increases to 209 \u2013 61 short of the compact taking effect.\n\nGovernor Mills issued the following statement:\n\n\u201cI have spent the past ten days carefully considering this bill, reviewing arguments both for and against it, considering written materials and listening to people from across Maine.\n\n\u201cOpponents have raised legitimate questions about whether presidential candidates would want to visit Maine knowing that, under a winner-take-all system, their chance to win our electoral votes declines and, as a result, their time would be better spent elsewhere. Proponents have pointed out that two of the last four presidents were elevated to the highest office in the land despite having the support of fewer Americans than their opponent and in four presidential elections since 1876, the winner lost the popular vote.\n\n\u201cSome argue that this measure would dilute the influence of rural voters, although this measure ultimately would provide that each vote carries equal weight, whether the voter is a rural, urban or suburban resident, and thus create greater equity among voters. I see merit to arguments on both sides. I am also aware that enacting this measure is not irreversible and that it will not take effect until a number of other states with at least 61 cumulative electoral votes also approve the measure, and that it will have no effect on this year\u2019s Presidential election.\n\n\u201cWhile I recognize concerns about presidential candidates spending less time in Maine, it is also quite possible that candidates will spend more time in every state when every vote counts equally, and I struggle to reconcile the fact that a candidate who has fewer actual votes than their opponent can still become President of the United States. Absent a ranked choice voting circumstance, it seems to me that the person who wins the most votes should become the President. To do otherwise seemingly runs counter to the democratic foundations of our country.\n\n\u201cStill recognizing that there is merit to both sides of the argument, and recognizing that this measure has been the subject of public discussion several times before in Maine, I would like this important nationwide debate to continue and so I will allow this bill to become law without my signature.\u201d",

        "text": "Trump trial gets underway in New York with jury selection in historic case\nThe first criminal trial of a former president in U.S. history officially got underway Monday in a crowded Manhattan courtroom, where prosecutors and defense attorneys began the arduous task of seating a 12-person jury in the case of The People of the State of New York v. Donald J. Trump.\n\nFlanked by his attorneys in room 1530 of the Manhattan Criminal Court, Trump was seated at a table where countless defendants before him have appeared. Monday's proceedings started with lawyers for both sides arguing over several aspects of the case, including what evidence should be admissible and what questions should be asked of potential jurors.\n\nThe first 96 out of several hundred New York residents who make up the jury pool were sworn in just after 2 p.m., formally marking the beginning of the historic trial. More than half were quickly dismissed after they said they could not be fair and impartial. A handful of others said they could not serve for reasons that were not disclosed. Others were excused based on their answers to a questionnaire.\n\nTrump is charged with 34 state counts of falsifying business records related to a \"hush money\" payment his attorney made to adult film star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges, claiming the prosecution is part of a plot by Democrats aimed at preventing him from retaking the White House. The case is the first of the four criminal prosecutions against Trump to make it to trial.\n\nThe presumptive Republican nominee for president addressed reporters outside the courtroom before making his way inside.\n\n\"This is really an attack on a political opponent. That's all it is,\" Trump said. \"So I'm very honored to be here.\"\n\nThe first day of the Trump trial\n\nFormer President Donald Trump attends the first day of his \"hush money\" trial at Manhattan Criminal Court in New York City on April 15, 2024.

He quickly denied a motion from Trump's legal team asking him to recuse himself from the case. Trump's attorneys had argued that Merchan should step aside because of his daughter's employment at a consultancy firm that does work for Democratic candidates and progressive groups. Merchan said their argument relied upon \"a series of inferences, innuendos and unsupported allegations.\"\n\nTrump's lawyers and prosecutors from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office moved on to arguments over a handful of outstanding issues related to evidence, rules for the trial and the questions that potential jurors would answer.\n\nJoshua Steinglass, a member of Bragg's team, said the prosecution would offer evidence that Trump conspired with his former attorney Michael Cohen and an executive at the parent company of the National Enquirer to suppress damaging stories about Trump, and publish negative stories about his rivals, before the 2016 election.\n\nSteinglass said David Pecker, then the CEO of American Media, Inc., would testify that \"he ran these stories to bolster Mr. Trump's campaign\" and that they were \"shown to Mr Trump before they were published, so he could approve, suggest or reject changes.\" Steinglass said prosecutors would introduce evidence pointing to \"a deal struck between the defendant and AMI to put their thumbs on the scale.\"\n\nTodd Blanche, an attorney for Trump, said the evidence has \"nothing to do with the charged crime.\" Merchan sided with prosecutors, saying he would allow prosecutors to use the evidence at trial. The judge also said he would allow evidence related to Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model who also alleged an affair with Trump and sold the rights to her story to the National Enquirer.\n\nOther rulings went in the defense's favor. Merchan reiterated a previous decision barring the infamous Access Hollywood tape, in which Trump can be heard talking about grabbing women, from being played for the jury. He also disallowed a recording of Trump discussing the tape during a deposition.\n\nLater, prosecutors indicated they would ask the judge why Trump shouldn't be held in contempt for apparent violations of a gag order that Merchan imposed weeks ago. The order limits what Trump can say publicly about many of those involved in the case, including potential witnesses. Trump has attacked two well-known key witnesses, Cohen and Daniels, in social media posts since Merchan issued his order. Prosecutors asked the judge to hand down a fine of $1,000 each for three Trump posts and order that they be taken down. Merchan said he would hear arguments over the issue next week.\n\nAt several points during the arguments, Trump appeared to fall asleep at the defense table, his chin briefly dropping to his chest. In one instance, he was stirred awake by his attorney, Blanche, who touched his shoulder and spoke to him.\n\nThe jury selection process\n\nA court sketch shows former President Donald Trump at the defense table on the first day of his criminal trial in New York on Monday, April 15, 2024. Jane Rosenberg\n\nOnce the final pretrial questions were resolved, 96 of the more than 500 total members of the jury pool were escorted into the courtroom.\n\nMerchan began by laying out the allegations against Trump, namely that he \"falsified business records to conceal an agreement with others to unlawfully influence the 2016 presidential election.\" He continued by mentioning Cohen and Daniels.\n\n\"Specifically, it is alleged that Donald Trump made or caused false business records to hide the true nature of payments made to Michael Cohen, by characterizing them as payment for legal services rendered pursuant to a retainer agreement,\" Merchan said. \"The [prosecutors] allege that in fact, the payments were intended to reimburse Michael Cohen for money he paid to Stephanie Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels, in the weeks before the presidential election to prevent her from publicly revealing details about a past sexual encounter with Donald Trump.\"\n\nMore than 50 jurors said they could not be fair and impartial and were told they could leave. Court personnel then began asking the roughly three dozen others to answer 42 additional questions ranging from the mundane \u2014 what jobs they hold \u2014 to the more pointed, like whether they follow Trump on social media. A handful of jurors were dismissed based on their answers. One woman said she could not put aside her views of Trump. Another man was excused because his child was getting married in June.\n\nThe process is expected to take at least a week, and likely longer. Trump's lawyers and prosecutors will seek to whittle the group of potential jurors down to just 12, plus half a dozen alternates. Once jury selection is over, the two sides will then begin presenting their cases, with the prosecution going first.\n\nAs a criminal defendant, Trump is required to attend proceedings each day of the trial unless he applies for and is granted a waiver. Court personnel and lawyers from both sides have said they expect the trial to last between six and eight weeks.\n\nMerchan reminded Trump that he must be in court every day of the trial, and issued a standard warning given to all criminal defendants that he will be subject to arrest if he fails to show up. At the end of the day, the judge denied Trump's request to let him attend arguments next week before the Supreme Court over his claim of presidential immunity in one of his federal cases.\n\n\"Arguments before the Supreme Court [are] a big deal. It's an important thing. I could certainly appreciate why your client wants to be there. But having a trial in New York County Supreme Court ... is also a big deal and it's important that your client be here in person. He's a criminal defendant facing the indictment,\" Merchan said. \"I will see him here next week.\"",

        "text": "How Will the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election Affect Health Care Stocks?\nWe don\u2019t believe investing based on predictions about political outcomes is wise. That\u2019s because it\u2019s tough to accurately predict and invest ahead of potential changes in government.\n\nConsider how challenging it is to determine winners and losers before an election. Then, imagine trying to predict specific policy changes and how they could affect businesses and, ultimately, stock performance. Adding to the complexity, historical data shows that there\u2019s not much difference in how the stock market performs under administrations led by Democrats and Republicans.\n\nHealth Care Companies Are in the Political Crosshairs Again\n\nIn our view, no sector is more exposed to political oversight than health care. Health care spending accounted for more than 17% of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) in 2022, the most of any sector.1 What\u2019s more, health care touches the lives of every American and is a particularly significant issue for the oldest, most likely-to-vote citizens.2\n\nIn the U.S., health care pricing and access have long frustrated consumers and politicians. Congress has held hearings on drug prices since at least 1959. George W. Bush spent significant political capital revising the Medicare prescription drug benefit two decades ago. Since then, arguments in favor and against the Affordable Care Act (ACA) or \u201cObamacare\u201d have been ongoing since its passage in 2010. Pushing through Medicare drug price negotiation has arguably been the Biden administration\u2019s signal achievement.\n\nWith so much at stake, it\u2019s unsurprising that the pharmaceutical industry was the top spender on lobbying in the U.S. last year. Two other industries among the top nine spenders are also health care-related.3\n\nThe health care industry is vast, varied and has strong political ties, with deeply entrenched interests opposed to meaningful reform. This makes it highly challenging to implement broad changes.\n\nThis means that health care companies are experienced in adapting to changes in the political landscape. Furthermore, some companies operate internationally, selling their products in countries with diverse and complex regulatory systems. These companies are adept at managing their businesses under various political environments and conditions.\n\nSome historical perspective helps underscore this point \u2014 health care stocks outperformed the broad market over the 10 years after the ACA was signed into law, despite dire predictions to the contrary.4 We believe this demonstrates the sector\u2019s resilience amid different political and regulatory settings.\n\nWhy the 2024 Presidential Election Will Keep Drug Prices and Access in Focus\n\nThe cost of drugs is likely to continue to be a major concern for voters. The government has recently implemented several measures, such as negotiating prices directly, considering regulations for pharmacy benefit managers and encouraging the use of cheaper biosimilar drugs. In addition, policy changes over the last few decades have led to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approving drugs faster and with less evidence than in the past.\n\nThe 2024 presidential election provides more evidence that drug prices will remain on the political front burner. Candidate Donald Trump's website argues for \u201cbetter health care choices at lower costs.\u201d Though he provides no specific policy proposals, the sentiment is clear. President Joe Biden has better-defined policy priorities, including implementing Medicare drug price negotiation, which is set to commence this year.\n\nAnother factor ensuring that drug costs remain a prominent issue? We\u2019re witnessing the initial stages of rolling out potent new medications with hefty price tags. Obesity drugs, with their wide-ranging applications, have prices that are out of reach for the many individuals who could benefit from them. Similarly, new Alzheimer\u2019s drugs hold major promise for improving patients\u2019 quality of life, but critics raise concerns about their potential to bankrupt Medicare.\n\nWe believe these regulatory and market-based attempts to lower the cost of medicines should provide a net benefit for society by improving drug access and affordability.\n\nElection-Year Stock Performance Depends on How Individual Companies Navigate Change\n\nWe\u2019ve made two points. First, it\u2019s incredibly challenging to predict and base investments on potential political outcomes, Second, health care companies are adept at navigating dynamic regulatory landscapes. While we believe both statements are true, it\u2019s important to highlight that the impacts can vary across industries and individual companies.\n\nFor example, the emphasis on drug pricing means there\u2019s likely to be a particular focus on the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, unlike other segments of the health care sector. And while we don\u2019t invest by making top-down decisions, it\u2019s worth noting that others often do. Consequently, pharmaceutical and biotech stocks might come under intense focus if politicians vie with proposals on drug prices.\n\nIn an environment where drug profits face challenges, companies that can innovate, offer cost-effective solutions and handle the pressures on their existing drugs are likely to perform better than those that can\u2019t. An obvious example would be the stock of a company with a blockbuster drug facing imminent biosimilar or generic competition versus a firm under no such threat or with a more diverse drug pipeline.\n\nUltimately, we believe that agile and innovative businesses will continue to thrive regardless of which political party holds power in Washington, D.C. This is why we focus on companies with the potential to develop cost-effective, sustainable health care solutions that meet society\u2019s long-term needs.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "The forgotten man who almost became President after Lincoln\nOn April 15, 1865, President Abraham Lincoln died from his assassin\u2019s wounds. But if John Wilkes Booth\u2019s plot were entirely successful, a little-known Senator may have been thrust into the White House.\n\nBooth\u2019s full plot included killing Lincoln, Vice President Andrew Johnson, and Secretary of State William Seward. General Ulysses Grant was another possible target. But only two attacks took place on April 14, 1865, with Seward surviving an assassination attempt and Lincoln dying from Booth's single gunshot.\n\nAccording to the rules of presidential succession in 1865, only Vice President Johnson, and not Seward or Grant, was in line to replace Lincoln if he died. If Johnson had died, an acting President would be appointed until a special election could be held to elect a new President (and not a Vice President).\n\nThe acting President would have been the president pro tempore of the Senate, Lafayette Sabine Foster of Connecticut.\n\nThe Presidential Succession Act of 1792 controlled how the President was replaced if he died in office, quit, or was unable to perform his duties.\n\nThe act was changed in 1886 and 1947 to deal with different scenarios. The 20th Amendment addressed what happens if a president-elect can\u2019t take office, and the 25th Amendment cleared up the succession of a new Vice President and what happens when a president is temporarily unable to perform his or her duties.\n\nBack in 1865, Booth had convinced George Atzerodt, an acquaintance, to kill Johnson by setting a trap at the Kirkwood House hotel where the vice president lived. However, Atzerodt lost his nerve and didn\u2019t attempt to kill the Vice President, even though he had a rented room above Johnson\u2019s and a loaded gun was found in the room.\n\nIf Atzerodt or another assailant had succeeded, Senator Foster would have been acting President until March 4, 1866. And if Foster weren\u2019t available, Speaker of the House Schuyler Colfax would have been next, and last, in line to succeed Lincoln and Johnson.\n\nA special election would have taken place in November 1865, with the Electoral College convening in December 1865, and the presidential inauguration being held on March 4, 1866.\n\nThe person charged with the official notification of the states to start the special election process was the secretary of state. Luckily, William Seward survived an attack by assassin Lewis Powell.\n\nIf Seward had died, that power may have devolved on the assistant secretary of state, who could perform the duties as an acting secretary of state until a new President named a replacement who was confirmed by the Senate.\n\nThe assistant secretary of state on April 15, 1865, was Frederick W. Seward, the son of William Seward. Frederick Seward was also seriously injured defending his father during Powell\u2019s assassination attempt. (He would recover after Powell pistol-whipped him.)\n\nFrom what we know about Lafayette Sabine Foster, he was a conservative Republican who was named as the president pro tempore of the Senate about a month before Lincoln\u2019s death. Foster only remained in the Senate for another two years, failing in a re-election attempt. He was later a judge in his home state until his death in 1880.\n\nAccording to his obituary, Foster was \u201ca prominent figure in congressional life, as a clear and forcible debater upon great public questions, and as an unsurpassed presiding officer in the Senate, that he was most widely known and will be best remembered.\u201d\n\nFoster also was cited for being above the politics that led to his Senate defeat in 1866.\n\n\u201cHe was no seeker after popularity, certainly he never descended to any truckling arts to secure it, and probably to some extent he lost favor by the high tone of both his character and bearing, and by the selectness of his friendships,\u201d the obituary said.\n\nA New York Times article from 1875 sheds some more light on Foster\u2019s loss of his Senate seat. The Republicans picked another nominee at a caucus in 1866, and Foster signaled his agreement to run as a rival candidate supported by Connecticut\u2019s Democrats. Foster dropped out at the last moment to accept a judge's position in the state.\n\nThe Times article said Foster remained bitter about losing his Senate seat.\n\n\u201cHe does not appear to be have ever recovered from the disappointment of his defeat in 1866,\u201d the article stated.\n\nAnd what would have happened in the special presidential election of November 1865? The Republican Party was already split between its Radical and Moderate wings.\n\nGeneral Grant may have run for president as a compromise candidate, but other prominent Republicans included Seward, Colfax, Thaddeus Stevens, and Benjamin Wade.\n\nThe Democrats were also divided and had been badly beaten in the 1864 presidential campaign. Former New York Governor Horatio Seymour, the eventual 1868 nominee, was a key player in the party, as was George H. Pendleton, the 1864 vice presidential nominee. General Winfield Scott Hancock had presidential ambitions in later years, and he had personally supervised the executions in the Lincoln assassination case.\n\nThe former Confederate states wouldn\u2019t have been involved since they weren\u2019t readmitted to the union.\n\nBenjamin Wade replaced Foster as Senate president pro tempore in 1867 and nearly became acting President in 1868 when President Johnson avoided removal from office by one vote in a Senate trial.\n\nScott Bomboy is the editor-in-chief of the National Constitution Center",

        "text": "Politics of the United States\nIn the United States, politics functions within a framework of a constitutional federal republic. The three distinct branches share powers: the U.S. Congress which forms the legislative branch, a bicameral legislative body comprising the House of Representatives and the Senate; the executive branch, which is headed by the president of the United States, who serves as the country's head of state and government; and the judicial branch, composed of the Supreme Court and lower federal courts, and which exercises judicial power.\n\nEach of the 50 individual state governments has the power to make laws within its jurisdiction that are not granted to the federal government nor denied to the states in the U.S. Constitution. Each state also has a constitution following the pattern of the federal constitution but differing in details. Each has three branches: an executive branch headed by a governor, a legislative body, and a judicial branch. At the local level, governments are found in counties or county-equivalents, and beneath them individual municipalities, townships, school districts, and special districts.\n\nOfficials are popularly elected at the federal, state and local levels, with the major exception being the President, who is instead elected indirectly by the people through the Electoral College. American politics is dominated by two parties, which since the American Civil War have been the Democratic Party and the Republican Party, although other parties have run candidates. Since the mid-20th century, the Democratic Party has generally supported left-leaning policies, while the Republican Party has generally supported right-leaning ones. Both parties have no formal central organization at the national level that controls membership, elected officials or political policies; thus, each party has traditionally had factions and individuals that deviated from party positions. Almost all public officials in America are elected from single-member districts and win office by winning a plurality of votes cast (i.e. more than any other candidate, but not necessarily a majority). Suffrage is nearly universal for citizens 18 years of age and older, with the notable exception of registered felons in some states.\n\nFederal government [ edit ]\n\nFlowchart of the U.S. federal political system\n\nThe United States is a constitutional federal republic, in which the president (the head of state and head of government), Congress, and judiciary share powers reserved to the national government, and the federal government shares sovereignty with the state governments.\n\nThe federal government is divided into three branches, as per the specific terms articulated in the U.S. Constitution:\n\nThe federal government's layout is explained in the Constitution. Two political parties, the Democratic Party and the Republican Party, have dominated American politics since the American Civil War, although other parties have existed.\n\nThere are major differences between the political system of the United States and that of many other developed countries, including:\n\nThe federal entity created by the U.S. Constitution is the dominant feature of the American governmental system, as citizens are also subject to a state government and various units of local government (such as counties, municipalities, and special districts).\n\nState government [ edit ]\n\nState governments have the power to make laws on all subjects that are not granted to the federal government nor denied to the states in the U.S. Constitution. These include education, family law, contract law, and most crimes. Unlike the federal government, which only has those powers granted to it in the Constitution, a state government has inherent powers allowing it to act unless limited by a provision of the state or national constitution.\n\nLike the federal government, state governments have three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. The chief executive of a state is its popularly elected governor, who typically holds office for a four-year term (although in some states the term is two years). Except for Nebraska, which has unicameral legislature, all states have a bicameral legislature, with the upper house usually called the Senate and the lower house called the House of Representatives, the Assembly or something similar. In most states, senators serve four-year terms, and members of the lower house serve two-year terms.\n\nThe constitutions of the various states differ in some details but generally follow a pattern similar to that of the federal Constitution, including a statement of the rights of the people and a plan for organizing the government, and are generally more detailed.\n\nAt the state and local level, the process of initiatives and referendums allow citizens to place new legislation on a popular ballot, or to place legislation that has recently been passed by a legislature on a ballot for a popular vote. Initiatives and referendums, along with recall elections and popular primary elections, are signature reforms of the Progressive Era; they are written into several state constitutions, particularly in the Western states, but not found at the federal level.\n\nLocal government [ edit ]\n\nOn Election Day on the first Tuesday in November, citizens all around the United States vote for political offices. (Shown is San Francisco City Hall commemorating the occasion.)\n\nThe United States Census Bureau conducts the Census of Governments every five years, categorizing four types of local governmental jurisdictions below the level of the state:[1]\n\nCounty governments Town or township governments Municipal governments Special-purpose local governments, including both school districts and other special districts\n\nIn 2010, there were 89,500 total local governments, including 3,033 counties, 19,492 municipalities, 16,500 townships, 13,000 school districts, and 37,000 other special districts.[2] Local governments directly serve the needs of the people, providing everything from police and fire protection to sanitary codes, health regulations, education, public transportation, and housing. Typically local elections are nonpartisan \u2014 local activists suspend their party affiliations when campaigning and governing.[3]\n\nCounty government [ edit ]\n\nThe county is the administrative subdivision of the state, authorized by state constitutions and statutes. The county equivalents in Louisiana are called parishes, while those in Alaska are called boroughs.\n\nThe specific governmental powers of counties vary widely between the states. In some states, mainly in New England, they are primarily used as judicial districts. In other states, counties have broad powers in housing, education, transportation and recreation. County government has been eliminated throughout Connecticut, Rhode Island, and in parts of Massachusetts; while the Unorganized Borough area of Alaska (which makes up about a half of the area of the state) does not operate under a county-level government at all. In areas that do not have any county governmental function and are simply a division of land, services are provided either by lower level townships or municipalities, or the state.\n\nCounties may contain a number of cities, towns, villages, or hamlets. Some cities\u2014including Philadelphia, Honolulu, San Francisco, Nashville, and Denver\u2014are consolidated city-counties, where the municipality and the county have been merged into a unified, coterminous jurisdiction\u2014that is to say, these counties consist in their entirety of a single municipality whose city government also operates as the county government. Some counties, such as Arlington County, Virginia, do not have any additional subdivisions. Some states contain independent cities that are not part of any county; although it may still function as if it was a consolidated city-county, an independent city was legally separated from any county. Some municipalities are in multiple counties; New York City is uniquely partitioned into five boroughs that are each coterminous with a county.\n\nIn most U.S. counties, one town or city is designated as the county seat, and this is where the county government offices are located and where the board of commissioners or supervisors meets. In small counties, boards are chosen by the county; in the larger ones, supervisors represent separate districts or townships. The board collects taxes for state and local governments; borrows and appropriates money; fixes the salaries of county employees; supervises elections; builds and maintains highways and bridges; and administers national, state, and county welfare programs. In very small counties, the executive and legislative power may lie entirely with a sole commissioner, who is assisted by boards to supervise taxes and elections.\n\nTown or township governments [ edit ]\n\nTown or township governments are organized local governments authorized in the state constitutions and statutes of 20 Northeastern and Midwestern states,[1] established as minor civil divisions to provide general government for a geographic subdivision of a county where there is no municipality. In New York, Wisconsin and New England, these county subdivisions are called towns.\n\nIn many other states, the term town does not have any specific meaning; it is simply an informal term applied to populated places (both incorporated and unincorporated municipalities). Moreover, in some states, the term town is equivalent to how civil townships are used in other states.\n\nLike counties, the specific responsibilities to townships vary based on each state. Many states grant townships some governmental powers, making them civil townships, either independently or as a part of the county government. In others, survey townships are non-governmental. Towns in the six New England states and townships in New Jersey and Pennsylvania are included in this category by the Census Bureau, despite the fact that they are legally municipal corporations, since their structure has no necessary relation to concentration of population,[1] which is typical of municipalities elsewhere in the United States. In particular, towns in New England have considerably more power than most townships elsewhere and often function as legally equivalent to cities, typically exercising the full range of powers that are divided between counties, townships, and cities in other states.[4]\n\nTownship functions are generally overseen by a governing board, whose name also varies from state to state.\n\nMunicipal governments [ edit ]\n\nMunicipal governments are organized local governments authorized in state constitutions and statutes, established to provide general government for a defined area, generally corresponding to a population center rather than one of a set of areas into which a county is divided. The category includes those governments designated as cities, boroughs (except in Alaska), towns (except in Minnesota and Wisconsin), and villages.[5] This concept corresponds roughly to the \"incorporated places\" that are recognized in by the U.S. Census Bureau, although the Census Bureau excludes New England towns from their statistics for this category, and the count of municipal governments excludes places that are governmentally inactive.\n\nAbout 28 percent of Americans live in cities of 100,000 or more population.[when?] Types of city governments vary widely across the nation. Almost all have a central council, elected by the voters, and an executive officer, assisted by various department heads, to manage the city's affairs. Cities in the West and South usually have nonpartisan local politics.\n\nThere are three general types of municipal government: the mayor-council, the commission, and the council-manager. These are the pure forms; many cities have developed a combination of two or three of them.\n\nThis is the oldest form of city government in the United States and, until the beginning of the 20th century, was used by nearly all American cities. Its structure is like that of the state and national governments, with an elected mayor as chief of the executive branch and an elected council that represents the various neighborhoods forming the legislative branch. The mayor appoints heads of city departments and other officials (sometimes with the approval of the council), has the power to veto over ordinances (the laws of the city), and often is responsible for preparing the city's budget. The council passes city ordinances, sets the tax rate on property, and apportions money among the various city departments. As cities have grown, council seats have usually come to represent more than a single neighborhood.\n\nCommission [ edit ]\n\nThis combines both the legislative and executive functions in one group of officials, usually three or more in number, elected city-wide. Each commissioner supervises the work of one or more city departments. Commissioners also set policies and rules by which the city is operated. One is named chairperson of the body and is often called the mayor, although their power is equivalent to that of the other commissioners.[6]\n\nThe city manager is a response to the increasing complexity of urban problems that need management ability not often possessed by elected public officials. The answer has been to entrust most of the executive powers, including law enforcement and provision of services, to a highly trained and experienced professional city manager.\n\nThe council-manager plan has been adopted by a large number of cities. Under this plan, a small, elected council makes the city ordinances and sets policy, but hires a paid administrator, also called a city manager, to carry out its decisions. The manager draws up the city budget and supervises most of the departments. Usually, there is no set term; the manager serves as long as the council is satisfied with their work.\n\nUnincorporated areas [ edit ]\n\nSome states contain unincorporated areas, which are areas of land not governed by any local authorities below that at the county level. Residents of unincorporated areas only need to pay taxes to the county, state and federal governments as opposed to the municipal government as well. A notable example of this is Paradise, Nevada, an unincorporated area where many of the casinos commonly associated with Las Vegas are situated.[7]\n\nSpecial-purpose local governments [ edit ]\n\nIn addition to general-purpose government entities legislating at the state, county, and city level, special-purpose areas may exist as well, provide one or more specific services that are not being supplied by other existing governments.[8] School districts are organized local entities providing public elementary and secondary education which, under state law, have sufficient administrative and fiscal autonomy to qualify as separate governments.\n\nSpecial districts are authorized by state law to provide designated functions as established in the district's charter or other founding document, and with sufficient administrative and fiscal autonomy to qualify as separate governments;[9] known by a variety of titles, including districts, authorities, boards, commissions, etc., as specified in the enabling state legislation.\n\nUnincorporated territories [ edit ]\n\nThe United States possesses a number of unincorporated territories, including 16 island territories across the globe.[10] These are areas of land which are not under the jurisdiction of any state, and do not have a government established by Congress through an organic act. Citizens of these territories can vote for members of their own local governments, and some can also elect representatives to serve in Congress\u2014though they only have observer status.[10] The unincorporated territories of the U.S. include the permanently inhabited territories of American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands; as well as minor outlying islands such as Baker Island, Howland Island, Jarvis Island, Johnston Atoll, Kingman Reef, Midway Atoll, Navassa Island, Palmyra Atoll, Wake Island, and others. American Samoa is the only territory with a native resident population and is governed by a local authority. Despite the fact that an organic act was not passed in Congress, American Samoa established its own constitution in 1967, and has self governed ever since.[11] Seeking statehood or independence is often debated in US territories, such as in Puerto Rico, but even if referendums on these issues are held, congressional approval is needed for changes in status to take place.[12]\n\nThe citizenship status of residents in US unincorporated territories has caused concern for their ability to influence and participate in the politics of the United States. In recent decades, the Supreme Court has established voting as a fundamental right of US citizens, even though residents of territories do not hold full voting rights.[13] Despite this, residents must still abide by federal laws that they cannot equitably influence, as well as register for the national Selective Service System, which has led some scholars to argue that residents of territories are essentially second-class citizens.[13] The legal justifications for these discrepancies stem from the Insular Cases, which were a series of 1901 Supreme Court cases that some consider to be reflective of imperialism and racist views held in the United States.[10] Unequal access to political participation in US territories has also been criticized for affecting US citizens who move to territories, as such an action requires forfeiting the full voting rights that they would have held in the 50 states.[13]\n\nElections [ edit ]\n\nWomen's suffragists parade in New York City in 1917, carrying placards with the signatures of more than a million women [ 14 ]\n\nAs in the United Kingdom and in other similar parliamentary systems, in the U.S. Americans eligible to vote, vote for an individual candidate (there are sometimes exceptions in local government elections)[note 1] and not a party list. The U.S. government being a federal government, officials are elected at the federal (national), state and local levels. All members of Congress, and the offices at the state and local levels are directly elected, but the president is elected indirectly, by an Electoral College whose electors represent their state and are elected by popular vote. (Before the Seventeenth Amendment was passed, Senators were also elected indirectly, by state legislatures.) These presidential electors were originally expected to exercise their own judgement. In modern practice, though, the electors are chosen by their party and pledged to vote for that party's presidential candidate (in rare occurrences they may violate their pledge, becoming a faithless elector).\n\nBoth federal and state laws regulate elections. The United States Constitution defines (to a basic extent) how federal elections are held, in Article One and Article Two and various amendments. State law regulates most aspects of electoral law, including primaries, the eligibility of voters (beyond the basic constitutional definition), the running of each state's electoral college, and the running of state and local elections.\n\nSuffrage [ edit ]\n\nWho has the right to vote in the United States is regulated by the Constitution and federal and state laws. Suffrage is nearly universal for citizens 18 years of age and older. Voting rights are sometimes restricted as a result of felony conviction, depending on the state.[16]\n\nThe District, and other U.S. holdings like Puerto Rico and Guam, do not have the right to choose any political figure outside their respective areas and can only elect a non-voting delegate to serve in the House of Representatives. All states and the District of Columbia contribute to the electoral vote for president.\n\nCampaign finance [ edit ]\n\nPolitical donations by major donors in the US 2020 elections\n\nSuccessful participation, especially in federal elections, often requires large amounts of money, especially for television advertising.[17] This money can be very difficult to raise by appeals to a mass base,[18] although appeals for small donations over the Internet have been successful.[19] Opponents of campaign finance laws allege they interfere with the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech. Even when laws are upheld, the complication of compliance with the First Amendment requires careful and cautious drafting of legislation, leading to laws that are still fairly limited in scope, especially in comparison to those of other developed democracies such as the United Kingdom, France or Canada.\n\nPolitical parties, pressure groups [ edit ]\n\nPolitical parties [ edit ]\n\nBackground\n\nThe United States Constitution never formally addressed the issue of political parties, primarily because the Founding Fathers opposed them. Nevertheless, parties\u2014specifically, two competing parties in a \"two-party system\"\u2014have been a fundamental part of American politics since shortly after George Washington's presidency.\n\nIn partisan elections, candidates are nominated by a political party or seek public office as independents. Each state has significant discretion in deciding how candidates are nominated and thus eligible to appear on a given election ballot. Major party candidates are typically formally chosen in a party primary or convention, whereas candidates from minor parties and Independent candidates must complete a petitioning process.\n\nThe current two-party system in the United States is made up of the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. These two parties have won every United States presidential election since 1852 and have controlled the United States Congress since at least 1856. From time to time, a third party, such as the Green and Libertarian Parties, has achieved some minor representation at the national and state levels.\n\nSince the Great Depression and the New Deal, and increasingly since the 1960s, the Democratic Party has generally positioned itself as a center-left party, while the Republican Party has generally positioned itself as center-right; there are other factions within each.\n\nParty organization [ edit ]\n\nControl of the Senate, Presidency, and House since 1855, with blue for Democrats and red for Republicans. Any column where all three sections show the same color is a government trifecta; the other periods are divided government.\n\nUnlike in many other countries, the major political parties in America have no strong central organization that determines party positions and policies, rewards loyal members and officials, or expels rebels. A party committee or convention may endorse a candidate for office, but deciding who will be the party's candidate in the general election is usually done in primaries open to voters who register as Democrats or Republicans. Furthermore, elected officials who fail to \"toe the party line\" because of constituent opposition said line and \"cross the aisle\" to vote with the opposition have (relatively) little to fear from their party.\n\nParties have state or federal committees that act as hubs for fundraising and campaigning (see Democratic National Committee and Republican National Committee) and separate campaign committees that work to elect candidates at a specific level but do not direct candidates or their campaigns. In presidential elections, the party's candidate serves as the de facto party leader, whose popularity or lack thereof helps or hinders candidates further down the ballot. Midterm elections are usually considered a referendum on the sitting president's performance.[20][21]\n\nSome (e.g., Lee Drutman and Daniel J. Hopkins before 2018) argue that, in the 21st century, along with becoming overtly partisan, American politics has become overly focused on national issues and \"nationalized\" that even local offices, formerly dealing with local matters, now often mention the presidential election.[22][23]\n\nTwo-party system [ edit ]\n\n\"Third\" political parties have appeared from time to time in American history but seldom lasted more than a decade. They have sometimes been the vehicle of an individual (Theodore Roosevelt's \"Bull Moose\" party, Ross Perot's Reform Party); had considerable strength in particular regions (Socialist Party, the Farmer-Labor Party, Wisconsin Progressive Party, Conservative Party of New York State,[note 2] and the Populist Party); or continued to run candidates for office to publicize some issue despite seldom winning even local elections (Libertarian Party, Natural Law Party, Peace and Freedom Party).\n\nFactors reinforcing the two-party system include:\n\nPolitical pressure groups [ edit ]\n\nSpecial-interest groups advocate the cause of their specific constituency. Business organizations, for example, will favor low corporate taxes and restrictions on the right to strike, whereas labor unions will support minimum wage legislation and protection for collective bargaining. Other private interest groups, such as churches and ethnic groups, are more concerned about broader policy issues affecting their organizations or beliefs.\n\nOne type of private interest group that has grown in number and influence in recent years is the political action committee or PAC. These are independent groups organized around a single issue or set of issues, which contribute money to political campaigns for United States Congress or the presidency. PACs are limited in the amounts they can contribute directly to candidates in federal elections. There are no restrictions on the amounts PACs can spend independently to advocate a point of view or to urge the election of candidates to office. As of 2008, 4,292 PACs were operating in the U.S..[25]\n\nThe number of interest groups has mushroomed, with more and more of them operating offices in Washington, D.C., and representing themselves directly to Congress and federal agencies. Many organizations that keep an eye on Washington seek financial and moral support from ordinary citizens. Since many of them focus on a narrow set of concerns or even on a single issue, and often a single issue of enormous emotional weight, they compete with the parties for citizens' dollars, time, and passion.[26]\n\nThe amount of money these special interest groups spend continues to grow as campaigns become increasingly expensive. Many Americans feel that these wealthy interests, whether corporations, unions, or PACs, are so powerful that ordinary citizens can do little to counteract their influences.[citation needed]\n\nA survey of members of the American Economic Association (i.e., the Association of Professional Economists) found the vast majority\u2014regardless of political affiliation\u2014felt the prevalence and influence of special interest groups in the political process led to benefits for the special interest groups and politicians at the expense of society as a whole.[27]\n\nReligious groups [ edit ]\n\nDespite the constitution's First Amendment Establishment Clause (\"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion ...\"), religious groups (primarily Christian groups for historical and demographic reasons) have often become political pressure groups and parts of political coalitions.[28] In recent decades, conservative evangelicals have been particularly active within the broader Republican Party.[28] This influence has often translated into the passing of laws related to morality and personal conduct.[29] State alcohol and gambling laws, for example, are more restrictive in states with a higher percentage of conservative Christians.[29]\n\nHistory, development and evolution [ edit ]\n\nAmerican political culture [ edit ]\n\nColonial origins [ edit ]\n\nThe American political culture is rooted in the colonial experience and the American Revolution. The colonies were unique within the European world for their (relatively) widespread suffrage provided to white male property owners, and the relative power and activity of the elected bodies they could vote for.[30] These dealt with land grants, commercial subsidies, taxation, the oversight of roads, poor relief, taverns, and schools. Courts, (private lawsuits were very common) also provided Americans with experience in public affairs and law,[31] and gave interest groups such as merchants, landlords, petty farmers, artisans, Anglicans, Presbyterians, Quakers, Germans, Scotch Irish, Yankees, Yorkers, etc. control over matters left to the royal court, aristocratic families and the established church in Great Britain. Finally, Americans were interested in the political values of Republicanism, which celebrated equal rights, civic virtue, and abhorred corruption, luxury, and aristocracy.[32]\n\nConcepts of the Founding Fathers [ edit ]\n\nThe Statue of Liberty, a symbol of American freedom and openness to immigration\n\nTwo pivotal political ideas in the establishment of the United States were Republicanism and classical liberalism. Central documents of American thought include: the Declaration of Independence (1776), the Constitution (1787), the Federalist and Anti-Federalist Papers (1787\u20131790s), the Bill of Rights (1791), and Lincoln's \"Gettysburg Address\" (1863).\n\nAmong the core tenets were:\n\nPost\u2013World War II [ edit ]\n\nAt the time of the United States' founding, the economy was predominantly one of agriculture and small private businesses, and state governments left welfare issues to private or local initiative. As in the UK and other industrialized countries, laissez-faire ideology was largely discredited during the Great Depression. Between the 1930s and 1970s, fiscal policy was characterized by the Keynesian consensus.[35][36] After the \"Reagan revolution\" in the early 1980s, laissez-faire ideology once more became a powerful force in American politics.[37] While the American welfare state expanded more than threefold after WWII, it held at 20% of GDP from the late 1970s to late 1980s.[38][39] In the 21st century, modern American liberalism, and modern American conservatism are engaged in a continuous political battle, characterized by what The Economist describes as \"greater divisiveness [and] close, but bitterly fought elections.\"[40] Since 2016, the United States has been recognized as a flawed democracy in the Democracy Index by the Economist Intelligence Unit, partially due to increased political polarization.[41][42] According to the V-Dem Democracy indices the United States were 2023 the 27th most electoral democratic country and 3rd most participatory democracy in the world.[43]\n\nIn foreign affairs, the United States generally pursued a noninterventionist policy of \"avoiding foreign entanglements\" before World War II. After the war, when America became a superpower, for many decades the country embraced internationalism, seeking allies to contain Communism and foster economic cooperation.\n\nDevelopment and evolution of political parties [ edit ]\n\nBackground [ edit ]\n\nThe United States Constitution never formally addressed the issue of political parties, primarily because the Founding Fathers\u2014Alexander Hamilton, James Madison,[44] George Washington\u2014opposed them as domestic political factions leading to domestic conflict[45] and stagnation.[46]\n\nNevertheless, the beginnings of the American two-party system emerged from Washington's immediate circle of advisers, including Hamilton and Madison. By the 1790s, different views of the new country's proper course had already developed, with those holding the same views banding together. The followers of Alexander Hamilton (the \"Federalist\") favored a strong central government that would support the interests of commerce and industry. The followers of Thomas Jefferson, (\"Democratic-Republicans\") preferred a decentralized agrarian republic.\n\nBy 1828, the Federalists had disappeared as an organization, replaced first by the National Republican Party and then by the Whigs, while the Democratic Republicans evolved into the Democrats led by Andrew Jackson, and known for celebrating \"the common (white) man\" and the expansion of suffrage to most of them.\n\nIn the 1850s, it was the Whigs' turn to disappear, undone by the issue of whether slavery should be allowed to expand into the country's new territories in the West. The Whigs were eventually replaced by the Republican Party which opposed slavery expansion and whose first successful candidate for the presidency was Abraham Lincoln.\n\nDemocratic and Republican [ edit ]\n\nIn the 150+ years since the Democratic and Republican parties have been America's two major parties, though their policies, base of support and relative strength have changed considerably.\n\nSome eras in American politics include:\n\nThe New Deal (1933\u20141938). These programs of Democratic president Franklin D. Roosevelt designed to deal with the disruption and suffering of the Great Depression \u2014 raising of the minimum wage, the establishment of the Social Security and other federal services \u2014 created a dramatic political shift in America. Roosevelt \"forged a broad coalition\u2014including small farmers, Northern city dwellers, organized labor, European immigrants, liberals, intellectuals, and reformers\". The Democratic party became the dominant party\u2014retaining the presidency until 1952 and controlling both houses of Congress for most of the period until the mid-1990s. [ 48 ]\n\nOne year after the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president, American Facebook users on the political right and political left shared almost no common interests.\n\nDevelopment of voting [ edit ]\n\nIn pre-colonial and post-revolutionary American times, voters went to the polls and publicly stated which candidate they supported, rather than voting secretly, which was considered \"cowardly\" and \"underhanded\".[24] Originally, state laws required voters to be property owners, but \"by the time Andrew Jackson was elected President, in 1828, nearly all white men could vote\".[24]\n\nLater in the 19th century, voting was done by written paper ballot. A broadened franchise where many voters were illiterate or misspelling disqualified a vote, led to the use of printed ballots. Each political party would create its own ballot\u2014preprinted \"party tickets\"\u2014give them to supporters, and who would publicly put the party's ballot into the voting box, or hand them to election judges through a window.[24] The tickets indicated a vote for all of that party's slate of candidates, preventing \"ticket splitting\".[24] (As of 1859 \"nowhere in the United States ... did election officials provide ballots\", i.e. they all came from political parties.) In cities voters often had to make their way through a throng of partisans who would try to prevent supporters of the opposing party from voting, a practice generally allowed unless it \"clearly\" appeared \"that there was such a display of force as ought to have intimidated men of ordinary firmness.\"[24] The practice was dangerous enough that in \"the middle decades of the nineteenth century,\" several dozen (89) were killed in Election Day riots.[24]\n\nIt was not until the late nineteenth century that states began to adopt the Australian secret-ballot method (despite fears it \"would make any nation a nation of scoundrels\"),[24] and it eventually became the national standard. The secret ballot method ensured that the privacy of voters would be protected (hence government jobs could no longer be awarded to loyal voters), and each state would be responsible for creating one official ballot.\n\nSuffrage [ edit ]\n\nSome key events of suffrage expansion are:\n\n1792\u20131856: Abolition of property qualifications for white men were abolished. [ 67 ]\n\n1868: Citizenship was guaranteed to all persons born or naturalized in the United States by the Fourteenth Amendment, although Jim Crow laws prevented most African Americans from voting.\n\n1920: Women are guaranteed the right to vote in all US states by the Nineteenth Amendment.\n\n1964-66: Civil Rights laws and Supreme Court rulings eliminate tax payment and wealth requirements and protect voter registration and voting for racial minorities.\n\n1971: Adults aged 18 through 20 are granted the right to vote by the Twenty-sixth Amendment.\n\nConcerns, problems and criticism [ edit ]\n\nOngoing concerns include lack of representation in the U.S. territories and the District of Columbia; fear that the interests of some are overrepresented, while others are underrepresented; a fear that certain features of the American political system make it less democratic, a fear that a small cultural elite has undermined traditional values, and whether policy and law-making is dominated by a small economic elite molding it to their interests. Greater representation given to small states in the Senate and the Electoral College, \"first-past-the-post\" voting, gerrymandering, etc.\u2014have in recent years had a more extreme effect and have begun to create a disconnect between what the government does (in legislation and court rulings) and what the majority of Americans want.[68]\n\nIn an August 31, 2022, poll by Quinnipiac University, 69 percent of Democrats and 69 percent of Republicans replied yes to the question \"Do you think the nation's democracy is in danger of collapse\".[69] A 2020 study, \"Global Satisfaction with Democracy\" by the Bennett Institute for Public Policy at the University of Cambridge, found that\n\nfor the first time on record, polls show a majority of Americans dissatisfied with their system of government\u2014a system of which they were once famously proud. Such levels of democratic dissatisfaction would not be unusual elsewhere. But for the United States, it marks an \"end of exceptionalism\"\u2014a profound shift in America's view of itself, and therefore, of its place in the world.[70]\n\nConcerns about the American political system include how well it represents and serves the interests of Americans. They include:\n\nMore recently, concerns have included:\n\na significant disconnect between what the majority of Americans want and what its government does (in supreme court rulings, legislation, etc.). This has expanded since the 1990s due to systemic issues such as gerrymandering, the United States Electoral College, first-past-the-post voting, etc.\n\n\"a growing movement inside one of the country's two major parties\u2014the Republican Party\u2014to refuse to accept defeat in an election\";\n\na belief (without evidence) that voter fraud is \"being committed by minority voters on a massive scale\" preventing Republicans from being elected. [ 73 ]\n\nUnderrepresentation by gender, ethnicity and sexual orientation [ edit ]\n\nObservations of historical trends and current governmental demographics have raised concerns about the equity of political representation in the United States. In particular, scholars have noted that levels of descriptive representation\u2014which refers to when political representatives share demographic backgrounds or characteristics with their constituents\u2014do not match the racial and gender makeup of the US.[74] Descriptive representation is noted to be beneficial because of its symbolic representative benefits as a source of emotional identification with one's representatives.[75] Furthermore, descriptive representation can lead to more substantive and functional representation, as well as greater institutional power, which can result in minority constituents having both representatives with matching policy views and power in the political system.[74][76] Serving as a congressional committee chair is considered to be a good example of this relationship, as chairs control which issues are addressed by committees, especially through hearings that bring substantial attention to certain issues.[74] Though minorities like African Americans and Latinos have rarely served as committee chairs, studies have shown that their presence has directly led to significantly higher likelihoods of minority issues being addressed.[74] Given that racial and ethnic minorities of all backgrounds have historically been marginalized from participating in the US political system, their political representation and access to policymaking has been limited.[74] Similarly, women lack proportional representation in the United States, bringing into question the extent to which women's issues are adequately addressed.[77] Other minority groups, such as the LGBTQ community, have also been disadvantaged by an absence of equitable representation\u2014especially since scholars have noted their gradual shift from originally being perceived as more of a moral political issue to being considered an actual constituency.[78]\n\nPolitical representation is also an essential part of making sure that citizens have faith that representatives, political institutions, and democracy take their interests into account.[75] For women and minorities, this issue can occur even in the levels of government that are meant to be closest to constituents, such as among members of Congress in the House of Representatives. Scholars have noted that in positions such as these, even close proximity to constituents does not necessarily translate to an understanding of their needs or experiences and that constituents can still feel unrepresented.[75] In a democracy, a lack of faith in one's representatives can cause them to search for less-democratic alternative forms of representation, like unelected individuals or interest groups.[75] For racial and ethnic minorities, the risk of seeking alternative representation is especially acute, as lived experiences often lead to different political perspectives that can be difficult for white representatives to fully understand or adequately address.[74] Moreover, studies have begun to increasingly show that people of all races and genders tend to prefer having members of Congress who share their race or gender, which can also lead to more engagement between constituents and their representatives, as well as higher likelihoods of contacting or having faith in their congressperson.[75] In addition to making it more likely that constituents will trust their representatives, having descriptive representation can help sustain an individual's positive perceptions of government. When considering women in particular, it has been suggested that broader economic and social equality could result from first working toward ensuring more equitable political representation for women, which would also help promote increased faith between women and their representatives.[79]\n\nRace and ethnicity [ edit ]\n\nThere are 57 African American members of the US House (blue), 47 Hispanics and Latinos (red), 5 Native Americans (yellow), 18 Asian Americans (green), and 314 Whites (gray).117th Congress (2021-2023)\n\nThere are 3 African American members of the US Senate (blue), 7 Hispanics or Latinos (red), 0 Native Americans, 2 Asian Americans (green), and 88 European Americans(gray). 117th Congress (2021-2023)\n\nAfrican Americans [ edit ]\n\nAlthough African Americans have begun to continually win more elected positions and increase their overall political representation, they still lack proportional representation across a variety of different levels of government.[80] Some estimates indicate that most gains for African Americans\u2014and other minorities in general\u2014have not occurred at higher levels of government, but rather at sub-levels in federal and state governments.[80] Additionally, congressional data from 2017 revealed that 35.7% of African Americans nationwide had a congressperson of the same race, while the majority of black Americans were represented by members of Congress of a different race.[75] Scholars have partially explained this discrepancy by focusing on the obstacles that black candidates face. Factors like election type, campaign costs, district demographics, and historical barriers, such as voter suppression, can all hinder the likelihood of a black candidate winning an election or even choosing to enter into an election process.[80] Demographics, in particular, are noted to have a large influence on black candidate success, as research has shown that the ratio of white-to-black voters can have a significant impact on a black candidate's chance of winning an election and that large black populations tend to increase the resources available to African American candidates.[80] Despite the variety of obstacles that have contributed to the lack of proportional representation for African Americans, other factors have been found to increase the likelihood of a black candidate winning an election. Based on data from a study in Louisiana, prior black incumbency, as well as running for an office that other black candidates had pursued in the past, increased the likelihood of African Americans entering into races and winning elections.[80]\n\nHispanic and Latino Americans [ edit ]\n\nAs the most populous minority demographic identified in the 2010 US Census, Hispanic and Latino Americans have become an increasingly important constituency that is spread throughout the United States.[81] Despite also constituting 15% of the population in at least a quarter of House districts, Latino representation in Congress has not correspondingly increased.[81] Furthermore, in 2017, Latino members of Congress only represented about one-quarter of the total Latino population in the US.[75] While there are many potential explanations for this disparity, including issues related to voter suppression, surveys of Latino voters have identified trends unique to their demographic\u2014though survey data has still indicated that descriptive representation is important to Hispanic and Latino voters.[81] While descriptive representation may be considered important, an analysis of a 2004 national survey of Latinos revealed that political participation and substantive representation were strongly associated with each other, possibly indicating that voters mobilize more on behalf of candidates whose policy views reflect their own, rather than for those who share their ethnic background.[76] Moreover, a breakdown of the rationale for emphasizing descriptive representation reveals additional factors behind supporting Latino candidates, such as the view that they may have a greater respect and appreciation for Spanish or a belief that Latinos are \"linked\" together, indicating the significance of shared cultural experiences and values.[81] Although the reasons behind choosing to vote for Latino candidates are not monolithic, the election of Latinos to Congress has been identified as resulting in benefits for minorities overall. While it has been argued that unique district-related issues can take equal or greater precedence than Latino interests for Hispanic and Latino members of Congress, studies have also shown that Latinos are more likely to support African American members of Congress\u2014and vice versa\u2014beyond just what is expected from shared party membership.[76]\n\nNative Americans [ edit ]\n\nSimilar to other minority groups, Native Americans often lack representation due to electoral policies. Gerrymandering, in particular, is noted as a method of concentrating Native voters in a limited number of districts to reduce their ability to influence multiple elections.[82] Despite structural efforts to limit their political representation, some states with large Native American populations have higher levels of representation. South Dakota has a Native population of about 9% with multiple federally recognized tribal nations, and it has been used as a case study of representation.[82] A 2017 study that conducted interviews of former state elected officials in South Dakota revealed that even though many felt that they were only able to implement a limited number of significant changes for tribal communities, they still considered it to be \"absolutely essential\" that Native Americans had at least some descriptive representation to prevent complete exclusion from the political process.[82] Moreover, formerly elected state and local government officials asserted that ensuring that the issues and concerns of tribal nations were addressed and understood depended on politicians with Native backgrounds.[82] Historically backed suspicion and skepticism of the predominantly white US government was also considered to be an important reason for having representatives that reflect the histories and views of Native Americans.[82]\n\nAsian Americans and Pacific Islanders [ edit ]\n\nRelative to other, larger minority demographics in the United States, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI) face different challenges related to political representation. Few congressional districts have a population that includes over 50% Asian Americans, which can elevate the likelihood of being represented by someone of a different race or ethnicity.[75] As with other minorities, this can result in people feeling unrepresented by their member of Congress.[75]\n\nGender and political representation [ edit ]\n\nThere are 122 women members of the US House (blue) and 319 men (gray).117th Congress (2021-2023)\n\nThere are 24 women members of the US Senate (blue) and 76 men (gray).117th Congress (2021-2023)\n\nWomen have made continual socioeconomic progress in many key areas of society, such as in employment and education, and in comparison to men, women have voted at higher rates for over forty years\u2014making their lack of more proportional representation in the political system surprising.[77][79] Some scholars have partially attributed this discrepancy to the electoral system in the United States, as it does not provide a mechanism for the types of gender quotas seen in other countries.[79] Additionally, even though gerrymandering and concentrated political representation can essentially ensure at least some representation for minority racial and ethnic groups, women\u2014who are relatively evenly spread throughout the United States\u2014do not receive similar benefits from this practice.[75] Identifying the source of unequal gender representation of individuals can be predicted along party and ideological lines. A survey of attitudes toward women candidates revealed that Democrats are more likely to attribute systemic issues to gender inequalities in political representation, while Republicans are less likely to hold this perspective.[77] While identifying an exact source of inequality may ultimately prove unlikely, some recent studies have suggested that the political ambitions of women may be influenced by the wide variety of proposed factors attributed to the underrepresentation of women.[77] In contrast to attributing specific reasons to unequal representation, political party has also been identified as a way of predicting if a woman running for office is more likely to receive support, as women candidates are more likely to receive votes from members of their party and Independents.[77]\n\nSocial inequality and sexism [ edit ]\n\nSocial inequality and sexism have been noted by scholars as influencing the electoral process for women. In a survey of attitudes toward women candidates, women respondents were far more likely to view the process of running for office as \"hostile\" to women than men, especially when considering public hesitancy to support women candidates, media coverage, and public discrimination.[77] Political fundraising for candidates is also an area of inequality, as men donate at a higher rate than women\u2014which is compounded by gender and racial inequalities related to income and employment.[79] Recent increases in woman-focused fundraising groups have started to alter this imbalance.[79] Given that disproportionate levels of household labor often become the responsibility of women, discrimination within households has also been identified as a major influence on the capability of women to run for office.[79] For women in the LGBTQ community, some scholars have raised concern about the unequal attention paid to the needs of lesbians compared to transgender, bisexual, and queer women, with lesbian civil rights described as receiving more of a focus from politicians.[78]\n\nSocial pressures and influences [ edit ]\n\nSocial pressures are another influence on women who run for office, often coinciding with sexism and discrimination. Some scholars have argued that views of discrimination have prompted a decrease in the supply of women willing to run for office, though this has been partially countered by those who argue that women are actually just more \"strategic\" when trying to identify an election with favorable conditions.[79] Other factors, like the overrepresentation of men, have been described as influencing perceptions of men as somehow inherently more effective as politicians or leaders, which some scholars argue could pressure women to stay out of elections.[79] Others contend that the overrepresentation of men can actually result in \"political momentum\" for women, such as during the Year of the Woman.[79] Within some racial and ethnic groups, social influences can also shape political engagement. Among Latinos, Latinas are more likely to partake in non-electoral activities, like community organizing, when compared to men.[81] Despite differences in political activity and social pressures, elected women from both political parties have voiced their support for electing more women to Congress to increase the acceptance of their voices and experiences.[79] Furthermore, studies have found that increasing the descriptive representation of women can provide positive social influences for democracy as a whole, such as improved perceptions of an individual's political efficacy and government's responsiveness to the needs of people.[75] When women can vote for a woman candidate of the same party, studies have also found that these influences can be magnified.[75]\n\nLGBT political representation [ edit ]\n\nAlthough some scholars have disputed the benefits of descriptive representation, only a small number have argued that this form of representation actually has negative impacts on the group it represents.[83] Studies of bills relating to LGBT rights in state legislatures have provided a more nuanced analysis. Pro-LGBT bills tend to be introduced in higher numbers when more LGBT representatives are elected to state legislatures, which may also indicate an increased likelihood of substantive representation.[83] Increases in openly LGBT state lawmakers have also been hypothesized to inadvertently result in more anti-LGBT legislation, potentially as the result of backlash to their presence.[83] Despite the risk of negative consequences, at least one study has concluded that the LGBT community receives net-benefits from increased openly LGBT representation.[83] On the federal level, the presence of the Congressional LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus has been identified as improving the ability of Congress to address the intersectional issues faced by the LGBT community, as well as provide a source of pressure other than constituency on members of Congress to address LGBT issues.[78] Additionally, non-LGBT members of the caucus have been criticized for not sponsoring enough legislation, emphasizing the value of openly LGBT members of Congress.[78] While descriptive representation has provided benefits overall, scholars have noted that some groups in the community, such as transgender and bisexual people, tend to receive less focus than gays and lesbians.[78]\n\nDemocratic backsliding [ edit ]\n\nAt least two \"well-regarded\" global democracy indices \u2014 V-Dem Democracy indices,[84] and Democracy Index (The Economist)[85] \u2014 \"show an erosion of American democracy since 2016\".[86]\n\nDisconnect between public opinion and government policy [ edit ]\n\nA disconnect between \"the power to set government policy\" and political opinions of the general public has been noted by commentators and scholars (such as David Leonhardt).[87] The United States is \"far and away the most countermajoritarian democracy in the world,\" according to Steven Levitsky.[88]\n\nBefore the 2000 election, only three candidates for president won \"while losing the popular vote (John Quincy Adams, Rutherford Hayes and Benjamin Harrison), and each served only a single term\", while as of 2022 \"two of the past four presidents have taken office despite losing the popular vote\"[87] - George W. Bush in 2000 and Donald Trump in 2016.[89]\n\nLeonhardt points out that in one branch of the federal government\u2014the Supreme Court\u2014conservative legal decisions \"both sweeping and, according to polls, unpopular\" were delivered in 2022, what is likely the beginning of a reshaping of \"American politics for years, if not decades\" to come by the court's \"Republican appointees\". This is despite the fact that the president appoints the nominees, and that presidential candidates of the Democratic Party have won the popular vote in seven out of eight last elections (from 1992 to 2020).[87]\n\nIn the 2020 U.S. Senate, \"50 Democratic senators effectively represent 186 million Americans, while the 50 Republican senators effectively represent 145 million\".[87]\n\nExplanations include:\n\ngeographical sorting by ideology. \"Parts of the country granted outsize power by the Constitution\" (i.e. less populated states), formerly voted more or less similarly to the large states and urban areas that were granted less power. Thus \"the small-state bonus\" giving disproportionate power in \"the Senate and Electoral College had only a limited effect on national results\". This is no longer the case. Rural areas are more uniformly conservative and urban areas liberal. [ 87 ] More important is \"the winner-take-all nature of the Electoral College\" (all states except Maine and Nebraska), which gives greater bias to Republicans. [ 87 ]\n\nMore important is \"the winner-take-all nature of the Electoral College\" (all states except Maine and Nebraska), which gives greater bias to Republicans. faster population growth of large (population) states than small states. [ 87 ] The state with the largest population in 1790 was Virginia with approximately 13 times as many residents as the smallest (Delaware). Today, \"California, which consistently votes for liberal candidates statewide, \"has 68 times as many residents as Wyoming; 53 times as many as Alaska; and at least 20 times as many as another 11 states\". When a candidate wins a statewide election in California (or New York) by a landslide, these large numbers of popular votes mean nothing in the tally of Electoral College votes or Senate seats. [ 87 ]\n\nThe state with the largest population in 1790 was Virginia with approximately 13 times as many residents as the smallest (Delaware).

[ 87 ] the phenomenon of \"wasted votes\", whereby the increasing concentration of Democratic voters in large metro areas means Democrats often win elections in these districts by \"landslides\", leading to the overall nationwide proportion of votes for Democrats significantly less than the proportion of seats for Democrats in the House. [ 87 ]\n\n\n\nOligarchy [ edit ]\n\nIn 2014, United Press International reported that the political structure of the United States has become an oligarchy, where a small economic elite overwhelmingly dominate policy and law.[71] Some academic researchers suggest a drift toward oligarchy has been occurring by way of the influence of corporations, wealthy, and other special interest groups, leaving individual citizens with less impact than economic elites and organized interest groups in the political process.[72][90][91][92]\n\nAn April 2014 study by political scientists Martin Gilens (Princeton University) and Benjamin Page (Northwestern University) concluded that the U.S. government does not represent the interests of the majority of its citizens but instead is \"ruled by those of the rich and powerful\".[93] The researchers after analyzing nearly 1,800 U.S. policies between 1981 and 2002, stated that government policies tend to favour special interests and lobbying organizations, and that whenever a majority of citizens disagrees with the economic elites, the elites tend to prevail in getting their way.[72] While not characterizing the United States as an \"oligarchy\" or \"plutocracy\" outright, Gilens and Page give weight to the idea of a \"civil oligarchy\" as used by Jeffrey A. Winters, saying, \"Winters has posited a comparative theory of 'Oligarchy,' in which the wealthiest citizens\u2014even in a 'civil oligarchy' like the United States\u2014dominate policy concerning crucial issues of wealth- and income-protection.\" In their study, Gilens and Page reached these conclusions:\n\nWhen a majority of citizens disagrees with economic elites and/or with organized interests, they generally lose. Moreover, because of the strong status quo bias built into the US political system, even when fairly large majorities of Americans favor policy change, they generally do not get it. ... [T]he preferences of the average American appear to have only a minuscule, near-zero, statistically non-significant impact upon public policy.[94]\n\nE. J. Dionne Jr. described what he considers the effects of ideological and oligarchical interests on the judiciary. The journalist, columnist, and scholar interprets recent Supreme Court decisions as ones that allow wealthy elites to use economic power to influence political outcomes in their favor. In speaking about the Supreme Court's McCutcheon v. FEC and Citizens United v. FEC decisions, Dionne wrote: \"Thus has this court conferred on wealthy people the right to give vast sums of money to politicians while undercutting the rights of millions of citizens to cast a ballot.\"[95]\n\nNobel Prize\u2013winning economist Paul Krugman wrote:\n\nThe stark reality is that we have a society in which money is increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few people. This threatens to make us a democracy in name only.[96]\n\nA November 2022 study by Pew Research Center showed that majorities in both the Republican and Democratic parties held increasingly negative views of major financial institutions and large corporations.[97]\n\nGerrymandering [ edit ]\n\nGerrymandering is the practice of shaping the boundaries of electoral districts for partisan advantage\u2014those boundaries being reviewed and usually changed after every United States census, i.e. every ten years. Gerrymandering involves what's commonly called \"cracking and packing\".\n\n\"Cracking\" is the process of moving the boundaries of districts to spreads opposition voters thinly enough across many districts so that they constitute a safe margin below 50%. Cracking spreads opposition voters thinly across many districts to dilute their power.\n\n\"Packing\" is the process of concentrating opposition voters in one or more (but always a minority of) districts, to \"waste\" opposition votes. [ 98 ]\n\nUsed almost since the founding of the United States (the term was coined in 1810 after a review of Massachusetts's redistricting maps of 1812 set by Governor Elbridge Gerry noted that one of the districts looked like a salamander),[98] in the 21st century it has \"become a much more effective tool\".[98] Since 2010, detailed maps and high-speed computing have facilitated gerrymandering by political parties in the redistricting process, in order to gain control of state legislation and congressional representation and potentially to maintain that control over several decades, even against shifting political changes in a state's population. It allows the drawing of districts \"with surgical precision\".[98] According to Julia Kirschenbaum and Michael Li of the Brennan Center\n\nIn 2010, Republicans\u2014in an effort to control the drawing of congressional maps\u2014forged a campaign to win majorities in as many state legislatures as possible. It was wildly successful, giving them control over the drawing of 213 congressional districts. The redrawing of maps that followed produced some of the most extreme gerrymanders in history. In battleground Pennsylvania, for example, the congressional map gave Republicans a virtual lock on 13 of the state's 18 congressional districts, even in elections where Democrats won the majority of the statewide congressional vote.[99]\n\nAttempts to appeal to the Supreme Court to disallow gerrymandering in cases such as Vieth v. Jubelirer in 2004 and its passing up of \"numerous opportunities\" in 2017 and 2018 \"to decide upon the constitutional legality or illegality of gerrymandering\" has \"emboldened ever more partisan gerrymandering\".[98]\n\nIn addition to giving one party power beyond its popular support, gerrymandering has been criticized for weakening the political power of minority voters by concentrated them into district(s) (though this process can also help ensure the election of a representative of the same race).[82]\n\nPolarization increase [ edit ]\n\nSince the 1970s, the United States has grown more polarized, with rapid increases in polarization during the 2000s onward.[100] As a general rule, urban areas and suburbs have become more \"blue\", Democratic or liberal, while agricultural rural areas have become more \"red\", Republican or conservative. Since many states have no large or extensive urban areas the result is that there are many \"red\" states in the south and Midwest, while coastal states which contain extensive urbanized areas tend to be \"blue.\" Rural areas with a recreational focus such as ski resorts are an exception to the general rule.[101][102] The polarization has been both ideological (differences between the policy positions) and affective (i.e. a dislike and distrust of opposing political groups), than comparable democracies.[103][52]\n\nPolarization among U.S. legislators is asymmetric, as it has primarily been driven by a substantial rightward shift among congressional Republicans, alongside a much smaller leftward shift among congressional Democrats.[104][105][106] New Democrats advocated for neoliberal policies including financial deregulation and free trade, which is seen to have shifted the Democratic Party rightward on economic issues.[107][108][109] Since the early 2010s, the party has shifted significantly to the left on social, cultural, and religious issues.[110] According to the Pew Research Center, members of both parties who have unfavorable opinions of the opposing party have doubled since 1994,[111] while those who have very unfavorable opinions of the opposing party are at record highs as of 2022.[112]\n\nConcerns about refusal to accept defeat [ edit ]\n\nSigns reading \"Stop the Steal\" and \"Off with their heads\", photographed on the day of the January 6 attack\n\nMany commentators and scholars (such as David Leonhardt) have expressed alarm at the \"growing movement inside one of the country's two major parties\u2014the Republican Party\u2014to refuse to accept defeat in an election\".[87][113][114] In a survey by journalists (of the Washington Post) less than two months before the 2022 congressional election, a \"majority of Republicans\" in \"important battleground\" election campaigns, refused \"to say they will accept the November election outcome\".[115] Six key Senate and gubernatorial Republican party nominees refused to commit to accepting the results of the November election: Blake Masters in Arizona, JD Vance in Ohio, Rep. Ted Budd in North Carolina, Kelly Tshibaka in Alaska, Tudor Dixon in Michigan and Geoff Diehl in Massachusetts.[116]\n\nWhile the claim by a losing candidate that they won \"despite clear evidence he lost\", may have started with Donald Trump after his loss in 2020, during primaries leading up to the November 2022 general election, \"candidates across the country have refused to concede\u2014even in races that are not remotely close\".[117]\n\nThe trend has been manifest in the violent January 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol to prevent the certification of Joe Biden as president, the hundreds of elected Republican officials throughout the United States that the 2020 presidential election was \"rigged\", some of whom \"are running for statewide offices that would oversee future elections, potentially putting them in position to overturn an election in 2024 or beyond\".[87] According to Yascha Mounk, \"There is the possibility, for the first time in American history, that a legitimately elected president will not be able to take office\".[87]\n\nIn part the phenomenon is international, democracies are struggling in other parts of the world led by the forces of \"digital media, cultural change, and economic stagnation in affluent countries\".[87] Leonhardt states that \"many experts point out that it is still not clear how the country will escape a larger crisis, such as an overturned election, at some point in the coming decade.\"[87]\n\nDeterioration of other norms [ edit ]\n\nAbandonment of campaign debates [ edit ]\n\nIn the 2022 elections observers have noted lack of participation in debates between candidates, and in the \"retail politicking\" that has been a political \"clich\u00e9 ... for generations\" in American politics: pressing the flesh at \"diners and state fairs ... town-hall-style meetings ... where citizens get to question their elected leaders and those running to replace them\".[118] Replacing these are \"safer spaces\" for candidates, \"partisan news outlets, fund-raisers with supporters, friendly local crowds\", as the number of competitive House of Representative districts and \"swing voters\" grows smaller, and candidates concentrate on mobilizing the party loyalists rather than appealing to undecided voters (appeals touching on compromise and bipartisanship angering party hardliners).\n\nObservers see a danger in candidates\n\nAvoiding those tougher interactions cuts down on the opportunities for candidates' characters and limitations to be revealed, and for elected officials to be held accountable to those who elected them. For the politicians, it creates an artificial environment where their positions appear uniformly popular and opposing views are angrily denounced, making compromise seem risky.[118]\n\nOther norms [ edit ]\n\nUnder the campaign and presidency of Donald Trump, observers (such as political scientist Brendan Nyhan) noted some erosion of political norms and ethics\n\nAntiquated institutions [ edit ]\n\nThe US doesn't recommend its own political system to its allies creating new constitutions.[125] Democratic backsliding concerns have led to some academics on the other hand to warn that thanks in part to the rulings of the Supreme Court that exacerbated the flaws in these ancient institutions, the U.S. is already a one-party state, and no longer meets the minimum requirements to be considered a democracy.[126]\n\nSuggested reforms [ edit ]\n\nElecting Supreme Court justices [ edit ]\n\nWith an implementation of term limits and holding elections for Supreme Court justices, the United States could solve the contentious battle for when Supreme Court members unexpectedly die. Packing the Supreme Court proposals would fade away if an election was going to decide the outcome. Thirty-three states already elect their state supreme courts. William Watkins Jr., a constitutional scholar from the Independent Institute on National Public Radio, stated his proposal for 8 to 10-year one-time term limits, he also said justices are supposed to be like umpires calling balls and strikes in the game but are acting more like coaches tinkering with starting lineups, and calling hit and runs. Local district attorneys and county sheriffs are elected[127] and so could Supreme Court justices. The United States Senate used to be appointed by state legislatures before the 17th Amendment was passed in 1913 for them to be elected. A second constitutional convention of the states to amend the Constitution could be a way for this reform to proceed.[128][129] [130] [131] [132]\n\nTerm limits for congress [ edit ]\n\nAverage Age of Congress\n\nPercentage of Congress over the age of 70\n\nTerm limits for members of Congress was a movement that gained a lot of traction in the early 1990s. 23 State Governments passed legislation that term limited US Congress representatives from each respective state. The Supreme Court decision U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton in 1995 invalidated the term limit legislation found in those 23 states. Newt Gingrich's Contract with America promised legislation in the first 100 days for a constitutional amendment for term limits. However, the Term Limits Constitutional Amendment bill did not pass the 2/3 majority to move the bill forward and only passed with a simple majority of 227\u2013204. It would have limited the House and Senate to 12 years total, six terms in the House, and two terms in the Senate.[133][134][135][136] Today, U.S. Term Limits campaigns for 34 states to call for a Convention to propose amendments to the United States Constitution to create a Term Limits amendment.\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nNotes [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\nFurther reading [ edit ]",

        "text": "APA report calls on social media companies to take responsibility to protect youth\nWashington \u2014 Almost a year after the American Psychological Association issued a landmark health advisory on social media use in adolescence, technology companies and policymakers still have made few meaningful changes, forcing society to continue to search for ways to maximize the benefits of these platforms while protecting youth from their harms.\n\n\u201cSocial media platforms know that the answer is to structurally correct harmful design features and functions. Most children and adolescents lack the experience, judgment and self-control to manage their behaviors on these platforms, which is why we see over 50% reporting at least one symptom of clinical dependency on social media today,\u201d said Mitch Prinstein, PhD, APA\u2019s chief science officer. \u201cAge restrictions alone are not the answer, since kids find ways around them. And putting the responsibility solely on parents is not fair either. The developers must address the dangers inherent in these platforms and make their products safe for youth.\u201d\n\nAPA has issued a new report as a follow-up to its 2023 health advisory focusing on social media design features and functions built into these platforms that are inherently unsafe for youth. The new report points to the psychological threats these features and functions introduce and the developmental vulnerabilities they exploit.\n\n\u201cPolicies will not protect youth unless technology companies are required to reduce the risks embedded within the platforms themselves,\u201d the report says. \u201cAs policymakers at every level assess their approach to this complex issue, it is important to note the limitations of frequently proposed policies, which are often misreported and fall far short of comprehensive safety solutions that will achieve meaningful change.\u201d\n\nAPA calls for comprehensive design improvements to social media platforms to inform safety standards for at least four reasons:\n\nCreating a bright line age limit ignores individual differences in adolescents\u2019 maturity and competency;\n\nSuch proposals fail to mitigate the harms for those above the age limit and can lead to a perception that social media is safe for adolescents above the threshold age, although neurological changes may continue until age 25;\n\nLimiting access to social media may disadvantage those who get psychological benefits from social media platforms, such as peer support and access to science-based resources, which particularly impact those in marginalized populations;\n\nAge verification must also ensure that the storage of official identification documents does not exclude subsets of youth, create risks for leaks, or circumvent the ability of young people to maintain anonymity on social platforms.\n\nAddressing the role of parents, it says: \u201cMore robust and easy-to-use parental controls would help some younger age groups, but as a sole strategy, this approach ignores the complexities of adolescent development, the importance of childhood autonomy and privacy, and disparities in time or resources available for monitoring across communities.\u201d\n\n\u201cDelegating responsibility to parents, to app stores or to youth themselves does not address the vulnerabilities and harms built into the platforms,\u201d said Mary Ann McCabe, PhD, co-chair of the expert panel that put together the 2023 health advisory. \u201cThat responsibility sits with the creators and purveyors of these technologies\u2014the platform developers themselves.\u201d",

        "text": "Could the presidential election prompt a slowdown in cruise sales?\nAndrea Zelinski\n\nAlthough heads of luxury cruise lines expressed optimism about their business during the annual Seatrade Cruise Global conference in Miami last week, the upcoming U.S. presidential election is giving at least one of them pause.\n\nCruise lines spent the conference talking up their strong bookings this year. But the industry, and travel in general, has historically experienced slowdowns around election periods as political contests and candidates claim more advertising time and attention from consumers.\n\nThis year's November election could be a doozy of a distraction with the likely rematch between presumptive nominees President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump.\n\nWith an upcoming election likely to attract a lot of attention, outgoing Silversea president Barbara Muckermann (who announced Friday that she was leaving Silversea to pursue new opportunities) said Silversea and others have tried to frontload as many bookings as possible for 2025 to make up for any disturbance expected later this year.\n\nThe elections in North America are particularly distracting for the baby boomer market, Muckermann said during the panel of luxury-line chiefs. She said it would likely be \"very divisive.\"\n\n\"I expect that there will probably be some kind of disturbance in the market and noise very, very close to the election.\" She added, \"it's too early to say if we are going to survive another Trump election,\" which was met with low murmurs in the standing-room-only event.\n\nStill, an election doesn't automatically mean a drop in sales. As a former political reporter, and this being my first presidential election cycle as Travel Weekly's cruise editor, I'm curious how sales will ebb and flow in the second half of the year.\n\nWith Nov. 5 still seven months away, heads of Seabourn Cruises and Ritz-Carlton Yacht Collection declined to comment on the contest and instead pointed out that their bookings this year are strong so far -- as are Silversea's.\n\nAnd nearly every travel advisor I've talked to has said their bookings are up year over year, and several are expecting cruise lines will put out attractive promotions in the fall.\n\nDuring the debut of the Icon of the Seas in January, Royal Caribbean senior vice president of sales, marketing and trade services Vicki Freed said that though it's \"common\" to see a slowdown leading up to an election, \"we're not seeing that.\"\n\n\"I think some people are going to say, 'I want to get away,'\" she said as she addressed a group of journalists and writers. \"I know you're all media, but sometimes it's media overload on all the stress of the election coming up.\"\n\nShe added, \"typically, there has in the past been some slowdown during the election year, but we're not seeing that. I think we've all become a little numb to the politics that are going on right now.\"",

Tim Scott, who has represented South Carolina in the U.S. Senate since 2013, entered the race with a campaign announcement in May 2023.[5] He suspended his campaign on November 12, 2023[6] and endorsed Trump on January 19, 2024.[7]\n\nImmediately after polls closed at 7:00pm EST, multiple media outlets called the primary for Trump.[8][9] Trump received the highest number of votes of any candidate for either party in the history of the South Carolina primaries, breaking the record previously held by George W. Bush in 2000.[8][9]\n\nBackground [ edit ]\n\nThe Republican electorate in South Carolina is noted for having a high proportion of evangelical voters.[10] Socially conservative candidates have performed well in the South Carolina primary in past contests. In the 2012 Republican primary, Newt Gingrich beat eventual nominee Mitt Romney in the state with support from evangelical voters.[11]\n\nIn the 2016 South Carolina Republican primary, Donald Trump won with 32.51% of the vote, with the nearest opponent Marco Rubio taking 22.48%.

        "text": "Preventing U.S. Election Violence in 2024\nIntroduction\n\nThere is a serious risk of extremist violence around the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Many of the same sources of instability and grievances that precipitated the January 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol (along with other challenges to the outcome of the last election) remain present today. And, while the risk of far-right election-related violence is greater, the possibility of far-left extremist violence cannot be dismissed. Such violence threatens individual lives and the domestic political stability of the country.\n\nJacob Ware Research Fellow\n\nIt could also undermine the United States\u2019 international standing and foreign policy goals, in a year where at least eighty elections will take place around the world. U.S.-based election violence has already inspired one similar incident, in Brazil in January 2023, and further disruption could affect the rules-based international order in ways detrimental to U.S. interests as it embarks on a new generation in strategic competition. The United States would also benefit from serving as the standard-setter on several associated issues, such as disinformation on social media and the rise of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and its impact on elections.\n\nLessening the risk of such a contingency is therefore an urgent national security imperative. Political leaders and other participants in the political and civic process need to implement a range of measures to prevent and manage violent election-related extremism.\n\nThe Contingency\n\nSeveral plausible scenarios could develop between now and Inauguration Day. The scenarios can be broken down into events that occur before the election, during early voting in October and on election day in November, and in the weeks after the election, possibly lingering into the new administration. Each scenario poses different challenges to different constituencies and could be inspired or driven by differing accelerants.\n\nPre-election\n\nThe first and most urgent scenario involves assassination threats against campaigning candidates and other public officials. According to Seamus Hughes and Pete Simi of the University of Nebraska-Omaha, \u201cover the past 10 years, more than 500 individuals have been arrested for threatening public officials. And the trendline is shooting up.\u201d In recent years, for example, the lives of Vice President Mike Pence, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, and New York Republican gubernatorial candidate Lee Zeldin were all threatened. Nikki Haley, the Republican runner-up, requested Secret Service protection during her campaign, indicating that violent threats have already surfaced in this cycle as well. The United States has been spared a high-profile assassination for more than a half-century. However, lack of success should not be taken to suggest lack of intent. Precisely this point was underscored on June 14, 2017, when a far-left extremist opened fire at a baseball practice of congressional Republicans, gravely wounding House Majority Whip Steve Scalise before being killed by the congressman\u2019s Capitol Police detail.\n\nPreventive Action Update A snapshot of global hot spots along with expert analysis on ways to prevent and mitigate deadly conflict from the Center for Preventive Action.

The conventions will boast the largest collections of party members and leaders throughout the entire election cycle and could therefore attract individuals or groups with a vendetta. News headquarters will also be potential targets given extremist rhetoric depicting the media the \u201cenemy of the people.\u201d\n\nThird, dates associated with the former president\u2019s legal troubles could also trigger violent extremists. Trump\u2019s legal challenges have thrust the 2024 election into unprecedented territory, with the possibility of a presidential candidate running for office from the courtroom, and possibly jail. The public process and potential legal outcomes could accelerate and spur violent attacks.\n\nElection\n\nOnce voting begins, the first and most likely scenario is violence and intimidation at polling places and against election workers, or against drive-by or drop-off balloting sites and their collection points. This could include armed militia groups \u201cobserving\u201d the election for fraud but, in reality, intimidating voters. In 2020, for example, Oath Keepers gathered at polling places to, in Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes\u2019s words, \u201cprotect people who are voting.\u201d Such gatherings could intimidate voters and disrupt Election Day by dampening turnout. This scenario could be driven both by any candidate calls to arms as well as by grassroots voices sensitive to local issues, vulnerabilities, and voting preferences, and to individual poll workers expressing or acting upon their personal political views. Such violence provides less of a model for partners and adversaries in the international space, given that the November election will occur after most other 2024 elections have occurred.\n\nOnce voting is completed, threats could turn against those counting the ballots. During the 2020 election, some of the more vitriolic threats were delivered against election officials in swing states. The sequencing of vote counting can play a part, such as when early, mail, and absentee ballots, which tend to lean Democratic, are counted last, leading to \u201cred mirages\u201d in which Republican candidates take early leads that fade in the final legal vote tally. In 2020, for example, federal agents arrested two QAnon supporters from Virginia who showed up with firearms at a convention center in Philadelphia where votes were still being counted three days after Election Day. Political calls to \u201cstop the count\u201d or \u201cstop the steal\u201d can make a violent response more likely.\n\nOnce voting is completed, threats could turn against those counting the ballots.\n\nPost-election\n\nIn the post-election era, depending on election results, attacks against government buildings and/or law enforcement officials will likely be the preferred means as violent extremists aim to take the fight directly to those they deem responsible for malfeasance. This scenario was seen at COVID protests in April 2020, sprawling anti-fascist rioting that summer, at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, and the attack against the FBI in Cincinnati. Here, the main accelerant will be political rhetoric interpreted by violently inclined individuals as calls for violence. Perhaps the most significant lesson of January 6 is that even seemingly innocuous moments can provide the impetus for extremist gatherings given the right combination of messaging and momentum. Any number of constitutional milestones\u2014when electors vote in their home states; the January 6, 2025, counting of electoral votes; or Inauguration Day itself\u2014could thus provide the spark, particularly among far-right violent extremists. Far-left violence responding to a disappointing election result will likely be more sporadic and disorganized. Militant anarchists, in particular, could be active, as seen on inauguration day in 2017. Still, the bond between far-left anarchists and the political system is not as strong as on the right, making it unlikely that extremists respond to any call for violence from politicians.\n\nShould multiple, organized extremist elements take up arms in defense of their candidates or other interests, sustained violence between political factions across broad geographic spaces remains possible. This level of violence has not yet been reached during the current escalation in domestic terrorism, except at a small scale on American streets in clashes between the Proud Boys and anti-fascists. Should those skirmishes escalate, they would pose a serious threat to law and order. The gravest fear, full-scale and total civil war, remains unlikely, in large part due to the lack of safe havens or sanctuaries for extremists in the United States. Political divides today run along urban-rural delineations, not northern-southern, which will likely stunt any budding civil war in its infancy.\n\nWarning Indicators\n\nThe most urgent warning sign of impending violence will be the words of the candidates themselves. Political figures are certain to use divisive and perhaps even existential political rhetoric during the campaign, warning of an urgent threat to the rank-and-file of either political party and to the country as a whole. Politicians deploy such rhetoric to frighten their base into voting, but such action also increases the odds of individuals turning to violent solutions if their candidate loses or appears to be in arrears. Existential rhetoric from within the political system or from candidates or parties can translate into implicit and explicit calls for violence, including against members of one\u2019s own party, another important warning indicator. Even regular political rhetoric could be taken as calls to violence, particularly given that Americans are increasingly divided. Polls show that almost a quarter of Americans (33 percent of Republicans and 13 percent of Democrats) believe that \u201cAmerican patriots may have to resort to violence in order to save the country.\u201d\n\nThe most urgent warning sign of impending violence will be the words of the candidates themselves.\n\nCasting doubt over election results before voting commences heightens the possibility of violent extremism. \u201cPre-bunking\u201d of fair election outcomes sows doubts in the minds of voters who then see eventual electoral defeats as confirmation of fraud rather than a rejection of one\u2019s political platform, unlocking inherent confirmation biases. Politicians on both the left and right have been responsible for such rhetoric, the right issuing warnings of stolen dating back to the 2016 race, and the left often expressing concern over alleged voter suppression in predominantly Black southern communities.\n\nThe risk of more organized and widespread violence could be heralded by armed paramilitary mobilization, including on social media. January 6 was preceded by an onslaught of threats and public organizing, which was largely ignored by law enforcement and intelligence agencies. Extremist infiltrations of law enforcement agencies (including the Capitol Police) and the military, coupled with the radicalization of active duty service members, also bears monitoring as both would considerably undermine any mitigative countermeasures arrayed against violent actors.\n\nFinally, national security professionals should be vigilant in tracking foreign interference, whether covert (and therefore likely hidden from public view until after the election) or overt, including foreign leaders casting doubt on election results before voting commences. Adversaries such as China, Iran, and Russia will eagerly exploit any opportunity to weaken the United States and will likely issue widespread disinformation to cause disunity, as in 2016 and 2020. Social media remains a defining battlefield in twenty-first-century elections, and the situation has only grown more fraught with the development of powerful tools such as generative AI, which, for instance, was used to attempt to dampen the Biden vote during the New Hampshire primary. The social media platform X poses a particular new challenge. Owner Elon Musk has reduced content moderation and allowed disinformation on the platform, creating an opening for manipulation by domestic and foreign actors alike, as well as AI-generated content.\n\nImplications for U.S. Interests\n\nThe assassination of a politician or election official could seriously undermine U.S. democratic institutions and traditions. More broadly, the rejection of election results could undermine civil society and further polarize the nation, while the mere threat of violence at polling places could dissuade voters from making their voices heard, further weakening American democracy. Threats issued against poll workers undermine American democratic traditions; volunteers seeking to participate in the civic process do not anticipate being targeted for their service, and such threats could deter their participation.\n\nBut perhaps equally damaging, American political violence, particularly concentrated around election cycles, poses grave threats to the rules-based international order. U.S. electoral turmoil could provide a model for further seditious organizing in allied states. Such contagion has already been seen in Brazil, and could undermine election integrity in a year with upwards of eighty elections worldwide. Domestic violent extremism also undermines U.S. credibility on international human rights and its international security credentials. On January 7, 2021, for instance, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry claimed that American support for pro-democratic protests in Hong Kong was now a sign of hypocrisy: \u201cOn the issue of human rights, democracy, and freedom, double standard should be discarded. I hope the relevant countries can think about this and learn real lessons from it.\u201d An author linked to al-Qaeda, meanwhile, wrote that January 6 had made amends for mistakes made on 9/11: \u201cI realized the wisdom of God almighty in not guiding the fourth plane to its target, for their destroying the citadel of their democracy by their own hands ... is more damaging to them & more soothing to the hearts of the believers.\u201d\n\nU.S. electoral turmoil could provide a model for further seditious organizing in allied states\n\nU.S. electoral turmoil could also offer a \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d for state and nonstate adversaries to act\u2014whether through direct terrorism launched at the United States or U.S. interests, or other hybrid measures intended to undermine U.S. security and standing. Hamas\u2019s attack on Israel at a time of profound internal turmoil in that country is an example of such opportunism. Russia also launched its invasion of Ukraine at a time of perceived Western weakness and division.\n\nPreventive Options\n\nIn the same way that law enforcement officials deconstruct the motives, means, and opportunities behind criminal behavior to design more effective preventive measures, so too can election administrators assess policy options to lessen the risk of domestic political violence around the 2024 election.\n\nThe leading reason for the rise in domestic terrorism in recent years is a heightened motive or intent toward acts of violence. Reducing motive, therefore, is both paramount to prevention and a daunting challenge. In the build-up to the election, mainstream politicians on both sides of the aisle can use their platforms to speak out against division and publicly praise the integrity of U.S. democracy. Although federal politicians have been reluctant to be outspoken against divisive politics (perhaps warily watching the examples of Republicans Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, who no longer serve in Congress after sitting on the January 6 committee), state and local officials have been far more committed to upholding democratic norms in their constituencies. Many maintain the trust of a large swathe of the American people and can call for peace and calm. One example of this commitment is Republican Utah Governor (and Chair of the National Governors Association) Spencer Cox\u2019s Disagree Better initiative, which aims \u201cto model how to disagree better, setting an example and creating the permission structure and template for other public officials at every level to follow.\u201d Such measures, critically, do not touch on political or ideological differences, but instead emphasize shared interests such as civil disagreement and trust and faith in democracy.\n\nThe Joe Biden administration has several options to lower the country\u2019s temperature and promote a peaceful and orderly election process. For instance, President Biden could task agencies such as the Department of Education or Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to issue nonpartisan educational tools that teach the American public about the electoral process and its resilience to manipulation. Such positive pre-bunking could prevent electoral conspiracy theories from taking root as widely as they did in 2020. The Biden administration could also push states to reverse their vote-counting timelines to count the usually Democratic early, mail, and absentee ballots ahead of the typically Republican day-of votes\u2014or to count votes simultaneously. Although a hard mandate to count votes earlier could violate the Tenth Amendment, gentle encouragement could help reverse the red mirage that contributed to January 6 and the \u201cstop the steal\u201d movement\u2014although there is, of course, the danger of a \u201cblue mirage\u201d instead contributing to violence by far-left extremists. Media organizations could also avoid covering vote tallying, waiting to announce results until they are confirmed and finalized.\n\nThe Biden administration, as well as law enforcement professionals, could also look abroad for best practices on reducing intent to commit electoral violence. In Preventing and Mitigating Election-Related Violence [PDF], a policy directive issued by the UN Department of Political Affairs in June 2016, the first suggestion is \u201cReducing high stakes in politics, promoting measures to move away from \u2018zero sum\u2019 politics and ensuring against a monopoly of power by one group.\u201d One possible measure to reduce intent to violence, then, would be to promote democracy\u2019s guarantee that the voices and views of the expected losing entity can still be acknowledged and advanced despite electoral defeat. In other words, politicians could employ language promising inclusivity and unity, perhaps on issues of bipartisan concern such as immigration, providing assurances that all Americans would have a seat at the table in the new administration. As stated by UN guidance, \u201cWhen parties are quite certain of loss or exclusion in an electoral contest, especially when they expect to be \u2018permanent minorities\u2019 (to lose not just once, but again and again due to patterns of identity voting), the certainty of outcomes is also a strong causal driver of violence.\u201d In addition, the United States could publicize the cadre of international election observers to increase trust in the process.\n\nIn a time of unprecedented distrust of politicians and Congress, American civil society can also help bridge the trust deficit that extremist radicalizers often use to prey on vulnerable people, cajoled by politicians but ultimately acting independently of the political system. Religious leaders and educators, especially at the local level, have a unique platform to educate their constituents on the importance of free and fair elections and neighborliness, even if they vote differently. Sports stars and labor leaders, among other civil society actors, can also call for peace and calm without wading into political questions. The Department of Homeland Security, through its Center for Prevention Programs and Partnerships, could redouble its grant-making efforts to both national and local nonprofit organizations working to reduce radicalization and violent extremism. The private sector, chiefly social media companies, also bears a responsibility to moderate the most serious calls for sedition and disrupt extremist cells. Social media companies can set stronger standards for AI use on their platforms and work to undermine actors using AI to affect the election process.\n\nReducing the capability to inflict violence will also be central. Indeed, the successful application of lessons learned after January 6 would considerably strengthen the United States\u2019 electoral resilience. Intelligence sharing between federal, state, and local partners, as well as with fusion centers (defined by DHS as \u201cstate-owned and operated centers that serve as focal points in states and major urban areas for the receipt, analysis, gathering and sharing of threat-related information between State, Local, Tribal and Territorial (SLTT), federal, and private sector partners\u201d), is critical. Threats issued by extremist groups and networks should be taken seriously, unlike on January 6, when preparations were not commensurate with the volume of intelligence suggesting armed actors planned to descend on the capital. Government officials across the aisle could work with legacy media to emphasize the nonpartisan mandate of the DHS, FBI, and state and local law enforcement to undermine allegations of partisanship and politicization. Leaning on local police forces would also build legitimacy, allowing more trusted law enforcement to adhere to their job of keeping the peace in their communities.\n\nAt a tactical counterterrorism level, the Department of Justice\u2019s continued legal efforts to disrupt leading domestic extremist organizations\u2014including the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys\u2014builds deterrence against future acts of violence. Although the leadership of both groups is already serving jail time for seditious conspiracy as a result of January 6, which has undermined both groups while building a stronger deterrent against violence, such legal efforts could continue as the election cycle heats up. Government efforts to deter or defuse violence will be complicated, however, by extremist networks\u2019 continued adherence to the leaderless resistance (\u201clone wolf\u201d) strategy, which hampers the ability of law enforcement to penetrate groups and limits the intelligence value of any individual capture. Militant anarchists, for instance, will continue to operate in spontaneous \u201cblack blocs,\u201d which similarly complicate infiltration and arrests. Efforts to reduce particularly lethal weaponry will likely fall flat, but could still be attempted.\n\nFinally, law enforcement agencies could remove opportunities for violence by hardening soft targets and maximizing law enforcement readiness and even preparing for military intervention. The federal government\u2019s law enforcement agencies could seek to designate important events, such as the political conventions and the election itself, as National Special Security Events, which would open a range of new law enforcement tools to prevent and respond to violence. A streamlined electoral process, including the Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act passed in response to January 6, could also limit opportunities for violent interventions.\n\nMitigation Options\n\nMitigation scenarios assume efforts to prevent both motive and means to violence have failed. Therefore, the mitigative options will concentrate on limiting further opportunity while lessening the harmful impact of any early violent events. At the milder end of the spectrum of responses to early violence, a more visible law enforcement presence at various key sites could deter violence and encourage voters to safely cast their ballots. Focusing on local law enforcement would allay concerns of a federal government crackdown, allowing local authorities to emphasize the sanctity of the rule of law within their own communities. The hardening of such soft targets would also allow law enforcement professionals to limit the threat to civilian life should any violence erupt.\n\nFocusing on local law enforcement would allay concerns of a federal government crackdown\n\nA variant of the United Kingdom\u2019s Operation Temperer\u2014which allows soldiers to guard certain locations so police resources can focus elsewhere\u2014could be conducted during several phases of the election cycle using the National Guard. Particularly symbolic or important sites, such as the U.S. Capitol, could be sealed off from the public, as occurred in the aftermath of January 6. This approach has historical antecedents; the U.S. government deployed the military in the Reconstruction era to suppress threats by the Ku Klux Klan against Black voters. The major downside of such an approach would be the militarization of U.S. elections, which would undermine American democracy and yield a further propaganda victory to adversaries.\n\nIn a worst-case scenario, the Biden administration could attempt to declare martial law in order to suspend the electoral process and allow the military to intervene in particularly violent uprisings. However, such a move would pose an existential threat to American democracy, effectively ending America\u2019s status as leader of the free world with few clear and secure paths forward.\n\nThe Biden administration could also simply take a hands-off approach, believing that American institutions are stronger than those who would try to undermine them and recognizing that violence has failed in the past to undermine electoral processes, including during January 6. Such a \u201ckeep calm and carry on\u201d approach would yield control but could protect American institutions from further internal damage. It would also avoid feeding into right-wing narratives about the weaponization of the federal government, while ensuring that a cure for violence is not worse than the disease.\n\nRecommendations\n\nThe range of stakeholders, including government, the private sector, and civil society, with the power to help prevent and counter election-related violence in 2024 should prepare countermeasures at the motive, means, and opportunity levels.\n\nReducing motive\n\nThe Biden administration should encourage early and mail-in voting for voters on both sides of the aisle to thin election day crowds that could otherwise become targets, and states should be encouraged to count absentee and mail-in ballots early to avoid red mirages that could fuel electoral conspiracy theories. Media companies should avoid reporting on vote tallying until final results are confirmed.\n\nResponsible poll-watching should be amplified and celebrated, and efforts to introduce trusted authorities into the electoral system, such as the military-linked nonprofit Vet the Vote, should be encouraged. Publicizing and celebrating the integrity of the vote and of the many civil servants who contribute to its execution will demystify the process and build trust in the system.\n\nCandidates and both parties should commit to upholding critical democratic values such as truth, honesty, free press, and the rule of law. Policymakers from both parties should unite around political slogans that enhance trust in the electoral system and delegitimize violence. Such calls should be joined by segments of civil society, such as church groups, sports teams, and universities. Governors and other state and local officials should join the Disagree Better campaign. Given their leadership roles in the election process itself, state and local officials should educate their constituencies about the integrity of the electoral process, the nonpartisan makeup of poll workers, and the importance of adhering to democratic traditions.\n\nCandidates and party officials should avoid existential rhetoric and absolutist promises, which the United Nations has found to reduce tension in other contexts. Politicians should issue frequent reminders to their followers that they desire peaceful political change.\n\nGovernment agencies at the federal, state, and local levels should work to improve transparency and pre-bunk conspiracy theories questioning the legitimacy of elections. One possible model is how the U.S. intelligence community pre-bunked Russian justifications for its invasion of Ukraine in 2022\u2014although it is unclear who would be able to share such stories beyond party apparatuses and civil society organizations.\n\nSocial media companies, meanwhile, should take more aggressive steps to limit the free rein of electoral conspiracy theories on their platforms, while legacy media outlets should work to avoid sensationalist reporting, including reporting portraying the opposition party as an existential threat or individual politicians as corrupt or dangerous. Legitimate community note programs should be expanded to ensure bad information can be drowned out by factcheckers. Social media companies should take aggressive stances against AI-enabled disinformation and deepfakes, particularly as they concern political figures. Intelligence agencies should carefully monitor social media platforms for disinformation campaigns, surmounting threats issued by the political right against such activity.\n\nTrusted civil society actors, including religious leaders, labor unions, Hollywood, and sports teams and athletes, should call for peace and goodwill, avoiding discussions of politics or ideology to instead focus on widely shared values such as nonviolence. Trusted leaders should educate their constituencies on civics and election integrity, and should prepare to band together in nonpartisan fashion should violence erupt.\n\nReducing means\n\nLaw enforcement agencies should conduct trainings and improve intelligence sharing across levels of government, as well as with fusion centers and nonprofit organizations. Extremists should be taken at their word\u2014threats of violence or insurrection should not be dismissed as bluster or an unrealistic proposition. Professionals should not ignore lessons learned from January 6\u2014including keeping the National Guard on standby and not ignoring intelligence warnings. As part of such efforts, law enforcement agencies with different and overlapping mandates should establish best practices and plans to ensure smooth coordination. This process should be aided by designating national conventions, Election Day, and January 6 as National Special Security Events.\n\nLaw enforcement and intelligence agencies should strengthen their protection of political candidates, election workers, and voting infrastructure. The Department of Justice\u2019s Election Threats Task Force should be fully resourced and staffed\u2014and could expand its remit to protect polling places and particularly vulnerable politicians. The volume of threats could be so great that not every site can be protected, and law enforcement should be prepared to prioritize particularly high-value targets, beginning with leading politicians and important political locations.\n\nPolicymakers and pundits across the political spectrum should work to erode the prevalent framing of January 6 defendants as heroes and martyrs, building a stronger deterrent against acts of political violence. Civil society leaders and state and local officials should emphasize the critical importance of nonviolent means of driving political change.\n\nRemoving opportunity\n\nAny decisions made to dampen unrest or violence with massed law enforcement or military assets should be made as an absolute last resort, with the public blessing of influential civil society actors and mainstream politicians across the aisle. Such measures should be incremental, involving steadily increasing presences of law enforcement or National Guard units, in order to avoid the perception of an overreaching federal response.\n\nShould the United States fail to adequately prepare for the risks of electoral violence in 2024, the integrity of the election will be on the line. In a year featuring at least eighty elections around the world, the United States will also provide a blueprint for autocrats elsewhere seeing to contest and undermine their own elections. Ensuring a peaceful, fair, and thriving election is therefore of critical importance, both to American democracy as well as democracy around the world.\n\nThis publication is part of the Diamonstein-Spielvogel Project on the Future of Democracy.",

        "text": "Should age matter in politics? VCU professor discusses ageism in the 2024 presidential election and society\nWith Joe Biden and Donald Trump preparing for another presidential election, age-old questions about age are center-stage in a fraught political environment. Biden (81) and Trump (77) are the two oldest presidential candidates in U.S. history, raising concerns from political pundits, elected officials and voters over whether there should be age limits for leading the country.\n\nHowever, some experts argue that these concerns are rooted in ageism rather than fact.\n\nAt Virginia Commonwealth University, Tracey Gendron, Ph.D., has dedicated her career to raising awareness of the pervasive, invisible nature of ageism within society, and she is working to dismantle misconceptions about aging. She serves as chair of the Department of Gerontology at the VCU College of Health Professions, executive director of the Virginia Center on Aging and author of the book \u201cAgeism Unmasked: Exploring Age Bias and How to End It.\u201d\n\nVCU News spoke with Gendron on how ageism has influenced voter sentiment in this presidential election and the broader political narrative.\n\nWhat is ageism exactly? Does it intersect with other forms of discrimination?\n\nIn its broadest definition, ageism is stereotyping or discriminating based on age, whether directed at those younger than us or older than us. Age is a part of our identity that intersects with many others to form our unique selves. Similarly, ageism intersects with other forms of discrimination to create a compounding effect of marginalization, or \u201ccumulative disadvantage.\u201d\n\nWhen people express concern about the age of these two candidates, they often refer to instances where the candidates get the names of political leaders wrong or have physical stumbles. Are these concerns valid or just rooted in ageism?\n\nMany people are likely familiar with the term \u201csenior moment.\u201d It\u2019s a commonly used colloquialism used by people of all ages, which means \u201cI forgot.\u201d The implication is that \u201cold people forget things, now I forgot a thing \u2013 haha, I\u2019m acting like an old person.\u201d\n\nWhat a strange leap in logic to forget something at any age yet immediately dismiss it \u2013 and then go on to stereotype an older person. \u201cAh,\u201d you might say, \u201cbut everyone knows old people are more forgetful!\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the reality: Age alone is a poor predictor of health status because aging is not a homogenous, linear experience. People age and develop differently, and there are no milestones or expectations to make comparisons. If we automatically assume someone of a given age is not capable or in poor health, that is ageism.\n\nPeople of all ages get names wrong and have stumbles. In fact, when we are under stressful circumstances, we are all more likely to make a gaffe. All candidates for political office should be evaluated on their accomplishments and qualifications rather than by their age.\n\nA CBS News/YouGov survey found that three-fourths of Americans favor maximum age limits for elected officials. Is there something that is often overlooked in conversations about age limits? Should older age matter, whether in politics or other fields?\n\nAs I said, age is a poor predictor of health (and everything else, for that matter), which makes age alone an inappropriate guideline for eligibility. Given the individual nature of aging, it is impossible to set a specific age limit with any rationale other than creating an arbitrary norm. Creating age ceilings is essentially political disenfranchisement.\n\nThere are a few fields that are exempt from the ADEA (Age Discrimination in Employment Act), where mandatory age-based screening is allowed. For example, commercial airline pilots must pass a medical test every six months after the age of 40, and air traffic controllers must retire at age 56. The reasoning is that these specific fields require reflex-based physical and attentional-related skills.\n\nThis vastly differs from the skillset needed for an effective political leader, whose job is to make thoughtful, weighted decisions and who routinely relies on experts and trusted advisors.\n\nAge is simply not a good defining factor for cognitive ability. I\u2019ve seen it proposed that there should be a cognitive test for political candidates over a certain age. Given that people of any age can experience a decline in cognitive ability for any number of reasons (brain injury, exposure to toxins, depression, lack of sleep, medication interactions, etc.), such a test would have to be given to all candidates rather than singling out someone based on their age.\n\nThe conversation around candidate age focuses primarily on the negative aspects of aging. In what ways does aging positively impact a person's capabilities?\n\nGenerally speaking, people tend to hyper-focus on the more negative aspects of aging rather than acknowledging that aging is a process of change that includes both decline and growth.\n\nCrystallized intelligence, or abilities, represent the cumulative skills and memories that result from acquired knowledge. Multiple studies have shown that crystallized abilities continue to improve well into later life. Research has even found that as we age, we use both hemispheres of the brain during tasks. We know that fluid intelligence, which is the ability to process new information, declines as we age. However, we also know that older adults can use their fluid intelligence just as well as younger people if given more time to do a task.\n\nAs we age, we continue to grow and improve in many ways. Older age can benefit decision-making, critical thinking, resilience and coping skills. The knowledge and experience we gain as we age help us make more thoughtful and balanced decisions and weigh options and opinions.\n\nHow has the focus on candidate age and competency helped or hurt our broader awareness and understanding of ageism?\n\nThe discussion around age and politics has helped raise awareness of ageism and started a critical dialogue about how ageism impacts society. I see this as an opportunity to engage in conversation about age and debunk myths and stereotypes about aging and older age.\n\nEmbrace it, fight it: We seem to receive and give ourselves conflicting messages about age. How might we, as individuals and/or as a society, better navigate this dichotomy?\n\nAs a gerontologist, I\u2019m fascinated by the wide chasm between the reality of aging and aging myths and misconceptions. The first and most important thing you can do is educate yourself. Aging is the one universal thing every human being on the planet has in common. And yet, it is a subject very few people ever take the time to learn about properly.\n\nRecognizing that aging is the process of living and changing helps contextualize the experience. As individuals we can all embrace that ALL stages of life come with both challenges and opportunities.",

Independents lean substantially to Trump in this month\u2019s survey, with 59% for Trump and 41% voting for Biden. Partisan loyalty is at its highest level since November for both parties in the April poll.\n\nIndependents have varied in which candidate they support in recent polling, as seen in Table 5. The variability in independent vote is due to both lack of partisan attachment and to the small sample size among independents, who make up 12% of registered voters in this survey.\n\nTable 4: Vote for Biden or Trump\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nParty ID Vote choice Joe Biden Donald Trump Haven\u2019t decided/Neither 4/3-10/24 Republican 9 91 0 Independent 41 59 0 Democrat 97 3 0 1/24-31/24 Republican 10 90 0 Independent 49 42 8 Democrat 91 9 0 10/26-11/2/23 Republican 10 88 1 Independent 47 47 4 Democrat 94 6 0 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin survey, latest April 3-10, 2024 Question: If the 2024 election for president were held today between former President Donald Trump, the Republican, and President Joe Biden, the Democrat, would you vote for Donald Trump or for Joe Biden or haven\u2019t you decided? Question: If you had to choose, would you vote for Biden or for Trump?\n\nIn the five-way ballot test, Kennedy takes more votes from Republicans than from Democrats and an especially large share from independents. Stein and West take more votes from Democrats than from Republicans. Independents are much more likely to support one of the third-party candidates than are either Democrats or Republicans. These results are shown in Table 6.\n\nTable 5: Five-way ballot, by party identification\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nParty ID Vote choice Biden Trump Kennedy, Jr. Stein West Don\u2019t know 4/3-10/24 Republican 4 79 13 3 0 1 Independent 23 32 32 5 4 5 Democrat 85 1 8 4 2 0 1/24-31/24 Republican 5 76 16 1 1 0 Independent 33 27 28 3 4 2 Democrat 73 5 12 8 2 1 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin survey, latest April 3-10, 2024 Question: If the presidential ballot included additional candidates, would you vote for Democrat Joe Biden, Republican Donald Trump, independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr, independent Cornel West, or Green Party\u2019s Jill Stein?\n\nSenate vote by party identification\n\nAmong Democratic registered voters, Baldwin receives the support of 94% and Hovde wins 6%. Among Republicans, Hovde holds 85%, while Baldwin takes 13%. Independents substantially favor Baldwin by 61% to Hovde\u2019s 37%.\n\nWith likely voters, partisan loyalty is slightly higher for both parties, but independents split almost evenly, 51% for Baldwin and 49% for Hovde.\n\nTable 6: Vote for Baldwin or Hovde\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nParty ID Vote choice Poll dates Tammy Baldwin Eric Hovde Haven\u2019t decided Registered voters Republican 4/3-10/24 13 85 2 Independent 4/3-10/24 61 37 2 Democrat 4/3-10/24 94 6 0 Likely voters Republican 4/3-10/24 11 87 2 Independent 4/3-10/24 51 49 1 Democrat 4/3-10/24 95 5 0 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin survey, latest April 3-10, 2024 Question: If the 2024 election for U.S. Senate were held today between Eric Hovde, the Republican, and Tammy Baldwin, the Democrat, would you vote for Eric Hovde or for Tammy Baldwin or haven\u2019t you decided? Question: If you had to choose, would you vote for Hovde or for Baldwin?\n\nEnthusiasm and likelihood of voting\n\nRegistered voters are less enthusiastic about voting than they were in March 2020, as shown in Table 7. In the current survey, 47% say they are \u201cvery enthusiastic\u201d about voting in November, compared to 67% in late March 2020. Enthusiasm has fluctuated over the most recent three polls, with a small increase in \u201cnot at all enthusiastic,\u201d rising from 6% in November to 12% in April.\n\nTable 7: Enthusiasm to vote in November election\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nPoll dates Enthusiasm Very Somewhat Not too Not at all 4/3-10/24 47 22 18 12 1/24-31/24 49 25 17 9 10/26-11/2/23 46 28 19 6 3/24-29/20 67 21 7 5 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin survey, latest April 3-10, 2024 Question: (2024) How enthusiastic are you about voting in the elections in November 2024 for president and other offices?

Would you say you are very, somewhat, not too, or not at all enthusiastic?\n\nThose who are more enthusiastic substantially prefer Trump to Biden, while those less enthusiastic prefer Biden to Trump, as shown in Table 8.\n\nTable 8: Vote for Biden or Trump, by enthusiasm\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nEnthusiasm Vote choice 2024 Joe Biden Donald Trump Haven't decided/Neither Very enthusiastic 41 59 0 Somewhat enthusiastic 45 55 0 Not too enthusiastic 64 36 0 Not at all enthusiastic 62 37 1 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin survey, April 3-10, 2024 Question: If the 2024 election for president were held today between former President Donald Trump, the Republican, and President Joe Biden, the Democrat, would you vote for Donald Trump or for Joe Biden or haven\u2019t you decided? Question: If you had to choose, would you vote for Biden or for Trump? Question: How enthusiastic are you about voting in the elections in November 2024 for president and other offices? Would you say you are very, somewhat, not too, or not at all enthusiastic?\n\nFavorability of presidential candidates\n\nTable 9 shows the trend in favorability to presidential candidates among all registered voters. All the candidates are viewed more unfavorably than favorably, and the independent or third-party candidates are much less well known than Biden or Trump.\n\nBiden\u2019s net favorability has been increasingly negative, while Trump\u2019s is less net negative than in November. Biden is now more net negative than Trump, reversing the order of November.\n\nTable 9: Favorability to presidential candidates\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nPoll dates Favorability Net favorable Favorable Unfavorable Haven't heard enough Joe Biden 4/3-10/24 -19 40 59 1 1/24-31/24 -17 41 58 1 10/26-11/2/23 -14 42 56 2 Donald Trump 4/3-10/24 -13 43 56 1 1/24-31/24 -18 40 58 1 10/26-11/2/23 -24 37 61 2 Robert F.

Their combined favorability trend is shown in Table 10.\n\nTable 10: Combined favorability to Biden and Trump\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nPoll dates Combined Favorability Biden fav, Trump fav Biden fav, Trump unfav Biden unfav, Trump fav Biden unfav, Trump unfav DK Biden or Trump 4/3-10/24 2 38 41 17 2 1/24-31/24 2 40 38 18 2 10/26-11/2/23 1 41 36 18 4 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin survey, latest April 3-10, 2024 Question: Do you have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of (INSERT NAME) or haven't you heard enough about them yet?\n\nSenate candidate favorability\n\nBaldwin\u2019s net favorability has improved since January, rising to +5 from -3. Hovde\u2019s net favorability has declined slightly, from -2 to -5. Both candidates are better known in April than they were last June. The percent saying they haven\u2019t heard enough about Baldwin has decreased from 22% in June to 11% in April. Hovde is much less well known but has seen dramatically improved public awareness of him, going from 85% who didn\u2019t know enough about him in June to 56% in April. These trends are shown in Table 11.\n\nTable 11: Favorability to Senate candidates\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nPoll dates Favorability Net favorable Favorable Unfavorable Haven't heard enough Tammy Baldwin 4/3-10/24 5 47 42 11 1/24-31/24 -3 42 45 13 10/26-11/2/23 -2 41 43 15 6/8-13/23 3 40 37 22 Eric Hovde 4/3-10/24 -5 19 24 56 1/24-31/24 -2 7 9 82 6/8-13/23 -4 4 8 85 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin surveys, latest April 3-10, 2024 Question: Do you have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of (INSERT NAME) or haven't you heard enough about them yet?\n\nA comparison from 2012\n\nCoincidentally, in 2012 both Baldwin and Hovde were non-incumbent candidates in their respective party\u2019s Senate primaries, allowing a comparison of current results to their first efforts in statewide campaigns.\n\nBaldwin, a member of Congress in 2012, was better known than Hovde throughout the pre-primary season, though over 30% said they did not know enough about her up to the date of the August primary. After the primary Baldwin became better known, with those not knowing enough to give an opinion about her falling to 15% in the final poll before the November election. Her net favorability was generally in the negative single digits. Baldwin was unopposed in the 2024 Democratic primary.\n\nHovde was somewhat less well known through most of the 2012 pre-primary campaign than he is in this year\u2019s April poll, with more than 60% then saying they didn\u2019t know enough to have an opinion of him. This declined to 49% in the final 2012 pre-primary poll. His net favorability fluctuated in the positive single digits, but fell to -4 in the final pre-primary poll. Hovde faced a four-person Republican primary, losing to former Gov. Tommy Thompson, 34% to 31%.\n\nThese trends are shown in Table 12.\n\nTable 12: Favorability to Senate candidates in 2012\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nPoll dates Favorability Net favorable Favorable Unfavorable Haven't heard enough Tammy Baldwin 10/25-28/12 -8 36 44 15 10/11-14/12 -16 31 47 18 9/27-30/12 -2 37 39 20 9/13-16/12 5 36 31 28 8/16-19/12 -5 32 37 27 8/2-5/12 -5 30 35 32 7/5-8/12 -5 26 31 38 6/13-16/12 -3 27 30 39 5/23-26/12 0 26 26 39 3/22-25/12 -6 20 26 46 2/16-19/12 -6 21 27 49 1/19-22/12 2 23 21 50 Eric Hovde 8/2-5/12 -4 21 25 49 7/5-8/12 7 19 12 61 6/13-16/12 1 14 13 62 5/23-26/12 2 15 13 61 3/22-25/12 -3 6 9 69 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin surveys, Jan.-Oct. 2012 Question: Do you have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of (INSERT NAME) or haven't you heard enough about them yet?\n\nIssues in the campaign\n\nTable 13 shows which presidential candidate is thought to do a better job on seven issues. Trump is seen as better on immigration and border security, the Israel-Hamas war, and the economy, and holds a slight edge on handling foreign relations. Biden has an advantage in perceptions on Medicare and Social Security, abortion policy, and health care.\n\nA substantial percentage, between 15%-26%, say on each issue that both candidates would be about the same or that neither would be good. These voters could change their minds over the course of the campaign, providing an opportunity for change in these perceptions.\n\nTable 13: Which candidate would do a better job on issues\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nIssue Who better Biden Trump Both about the same Neither good Immigration and border security 28 53 8 11 Israel-Hamas war 26 46 8 18 The economy 34 52 9 6 Foreign relations 41 44 5 10 Medicare and Social Security 45 37 12 6 Abortion policy 46 37 7 10 Health care 45 35 12 8 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin survey, April 3-10, 2024 Question: Do you think Joe Biden or Donald Trump would do a better job handling each of the following issues, they are both about the same or would neither be good on the issue?\n\nMost important issues\n\nRespondents were asked which of seven issues would be most important for deciding their vote. The economy is the top-rated issue, followed by immigration, abortion policy, and Medicare and Social Security. The other issues remain in single digits, as shown in Table 14.\n\nTable 14: Most important issues\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nResponse Percent The economy 33 Immigration and border security 21 Abortion policy 13 Medicare and Social Security 11 Foreign relations 6 Health care 5 The war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza 2 Don't know 8 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin survey, April 3-10, 2024 Question: Which one of the following issues will be MOST important in deciding your vote for president?\n\nPartisans differ on the most important issues, as shown in Table 15. Republicans are much more likely to rank the economy and immigration as most important, while placing little weight on any of the other issues. Independents rank the economy and immigration as their two top issues, with Medicare and Social Security as their third highest concern. Democrats put abortion policy as their top concern, closely followed by the economy and Medicare and Social Security.\n\nTable 15: Most important issues by party identification\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nParty ID Issue The economy Immigration and border security Health care Foreign relations Abortion policy Medicare & Social Security The war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza Don't know Republican 43 37 1 4 5 3 1 6 Independent 31 23 8 9 5 14 0 10 Democrat 22 1 9 8 24 19 4 11 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin survey, April 3-10, 2024 Question: Which one of the following issues will be MOST important in deciding your vote for president?\n\nImmigration\n\nViews of immigration and the policy that should be pursued concerning people who are in the country illegally vary with how the question is framed. The question that has been asked since 2012 is framed in terms of undocumented people currently working in the U.S.\n\nWhich comes closest to your view about undocumented immigrants who are currently working in the U.S.?\n\nThey should be allowed to stay in their jobs and to eventually apply for U.S. citizenship They should be allowed to stay in their jobs only as temporary guest workers but not to apply for U.S. citizenship They should be required to leave their jobs and leave the U.S.\n\nJust under half say undocumented workers should be allowed to stay and eventually apply for citizenship, while nearly a third say they should be required to leave the country and about a sixth say they should stay only as guest workers.\n\nThe option to stay and eventually apply for citizenship for undocumented immigrants is favored by 49% in the current poll, down from 67% in February 2020 and 64% in April 2022.\n\nThere has been an increase in the percentage saying that these immigrants should be required to leave the U.S., which is 30% in the April poll. That is up from 13% in Feb. 2020 and 16% in April 2022. This is the highest support for requiring undocumented residents to leave the country in the 22 polls that have asked this question. The full trend is shown in Table 16.\n\nTable 16: Policy toward undocumented immigrants working in the U.S.\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nPoll dates Policy options Stay and apply for citizenship Stay as temporary guest workers Required to leave jobs and U.S. Don't know 4/3-10/24 49 16 30 5 4/19-24/22 64 16 16 4 2/19-23/20 67 15 13 3 10/24-28/18 65 15 15 3 9/12-16/18 68 15 14 3 2/25-3/1/18 71 14 9 4 3/13-16/17 66 17 14 2 9/15-18/16 62 19 16 2 8/25-28/16 62 19 15 3 8/4-7/16 60 19 17 3 6/9-12/16 60 18 17 4 3/24-28/16 60 22 16 2 1/21-24/16 57 17 21 4 8/13-16/15 49 25 23 3 10/23-26/14 52 20 24 3 10/21-24/13 61 20 16 2 5/6-9/13 58 19 20 2 3/11-13/13 57 17 21 4 10/25-28/12 53 19 22 5 10/11-14/12 52 21 21 4 9/27-30/12 52 19 22 6 9/13-16/12 51 23 20 4 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin survey, latest April 3-10, 2024 Question: Which comes closest to your view about undocumented immigrants who are currently working in the U.S.\n\nAn alternative framing of the issue with no mention of working or options for staying in the U.S., asked later in the survey, is worded as:\n\n\u201cDo you favor or oppose deporting immigrants who are living in the United States illegally back to their home countries?\u201d\n\nWith this wording, a majority, 56%, favor deportations, while 39% are opposed and 5% say they don\u2019t know.\n\nThose who favor an eventual-citizenship path, as well as those who favor deportation, when worker status is mentioned in the first question, hold those opinions in the second framing of the question. Those who favor allowing undocumented workers to stay but only as guest workers are substantially in favor of deportation when the worker status in not mentioned.\n\nThe relationship between the two questions is shown in Table 17. Of those saying stay and apply for citizenship, 68% oppose deportation of those in the U.S. illegally on the second question. Of those who favor guest worker status, 73% say they favor deportation on the second question. Those who favored requiring undocumented workers to leave almost all, 94%, favor deportation of immigrants in the U.S. illegally.\n\nTable 17: Relationship between policy framings on immigration\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nUndocumented workers Deport those illegally in U.S. Favor Oppose Don't know Stay and apply for citizenship 25 68 6 Stay as temporary guest workers 73 26 0 Required to leave jobs and U.S. 94 4 2 Don't know 73 8 19 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin survey, April 3-10, 2024 Question: Which comes closest to your view about undocumented immigrants who are currently working in the U.S.? 1.

They should be allowed to stay in their jobs only as temporary guest workers but not to apply for U.S. citizenship 3. They should be required to leave their jobs and leave the U.S. Question: Do you favor or oppose deporting immigrants who are living in the United States illegally back to their home countries?\n\nAbortion\n\nA majority of the public continues to oppose the Dobbs decision overturning the constitutional right to abortion recognized in Roe v. Wade, with 62% opposed and 37% in favor of the decision. Opinion has been generally stable since August 2022, as shown in Table 18.\n\nTable 18: Favor or oppose the Dobbs decision overturning Roe v.

How much do you favor or oppose this decision?\n\nA majority, 54%, favor a national ban on abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy with exceptions for rape, incest, and the life and health of the mother, while 43% are opposed and 3% didn\u2019t know. This is the first time this question has been asked.\n\nIn January, a question was asked about a state policy for a 14-week ban, which was then being discussed in the legislature. In that poll, 45% favored such a policy, while 48% were opposed and 8% said they didn\u2019t know.\n\nHealth care\n\nHealth care did not rise to the top of the most important problems, but there has been increased political discussion of the Affordable Care Act or \u201cObamacare\u201d in recent months. In April, a majority, 51%, have a favorable view of the law, with 38% unfavorable and 11% who don\u2019t know. Views of the ACA have improved since 2017, the year efforts to replace the law failed in Congress, as shown in Table 19.\n\nTable 19: Views of the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nPoll dates View of ACA Favorable Unfavorable Don't know 4/3-10/24 51 38 11 2/19-23/20 48 48 4 4/3-7/19 45 49 6 9/12-16/18 47 45 7 6/22-25/17 41 51 7 3/13-16/17 45 46 8 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin survey, latest April 3-10, 2024 Question: As you may know, a health reform bill was signed into law in 2010, often called the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare. Given what you know about the health reform law, do you have a generally favorable or generally unfavorable opinion of it?\n\nBiden and Trump presidential job approval\n\nBiden\u2019s job approval in April stands at 40%, a one-point decline in approval since January, with disapproval at 57%. Table 20 shows the recent trend in job approval.\n\nTable 20: Biden job approval\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nPoll dates Job approval Total approve Total disapprove Strongly approve Somewhat approve Somewhat disapprove Strongly disapprove 4/3-10/24 40 57 16 24 8 49 1/24-31/24 41 58 18 23 10 48 10/26-11/2/23 42 57 17 25 12 44 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin survey, latest April 3-10, 2024 Question: Overall, do you approve or disapprove of the way Joe Biden is handling his job as president?\n\nBiden approval by party identification is shown in Table 21. Republicans are nearly unanimous in their disapproval of Biden at 95%, with independents\u2019 disapproval at 55% and approval at 34%. Democrats are quite approving of Biden at 81%, with16% disapproving.\n\nTable 21: Biden job approval, by party identification\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nParty ID Job approval Approve Disapprove Don't know Republican 5 95 1 Independent 34 55 9 Democrat 81 16 3 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin survey, April 3-10, 2024 Question: Overall, do you approve or disapprove of the way Joe Biden is handling his job as president?\n\nThe April poll also asked respondents if they approved or disapproved of the job Trump did when he was president. Forty-seven percent approved and 52% disapproved. This matches Trump\u2019s approval in the last Marquette Law School Poll survey before the 2020 election, when 47% approved and 52% disapproved.\n\nTable 22 shows Trump approval by party identification. Virtually all Democrats, 97%, disapprove of how Trump handled his job as president, while a large majority of Republicans, 86%, approved. Independents are closely balanced, with 49% approving and 47% disapproving.\n\nTable 22: Trump job approval, by party identification\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nParty ID Job approval Approve Disapprove Don't know Republican 86 14 0 Independent 49 47 1 Democrat 3 97 0 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin survey, April 3-10, 2024 Question: Overall, do you approve or disapprove of the way Donald Trump handled his job when he was president?\n\nVote choice is strongly related to approval, though Biden wins a majority of voters among those who somewhat disapprove of the job he is doing, as shown in Table 23.\n\nTable 23: Biden vs. Trump, by Biden job approval\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nBiden job approval Vote choice Joe Biden Donald Trump Total 49 51 Strongly approve 100 0 Somewhat approve 96 3 Somewhat disapprove 56 43 Strongly disapprove 8 92 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin survey, April 3-10, 2024 Question: If the 2024 election for president were held today between former President Donald Trump, the Republican, and President Joe Biden, the Democrat, would you vote for Donald Trump or for Joe Biden or haven\u2019t you decided? Question: If you had to choose, would you vote for Biden or for Trump? Question: Overall, do you approve or disapprove of the way Joe Biden is handling his job as president?\n\nIn contrast with Biden, those who somewhat disapprove of the job Trump did as president give a majority of their vote to Biden: 59%, compared with 40% who prefer Trump.

The survey was conducted April 3-10, 2024, interviewing 814 Wisconsin registered voters, with a margin of error of +/-4.8 percentage points. The sample contains 736 likely voters, those who say they are absolutely certain to vote in November, with a margin of error of +/-5 percentage points.\n\nThe survey was conducted with a hybrid sample of 588 respondents selected from the Wisconsin voter registration list and 226 selected from the SSRS Opinion Panel, a sample drawn from postal addresses across the state and invited to take part in surveys online. The interview was conducted online with 653 respondents and with 161 by telephone with a live interviewer. Full details of the methodology are contained in the methodology statement at the link below.\n\nThe partisan makeup of the sample is 34% Republican, 31% Democratic, and 34% independent. Since January 2020, the long-term partisan balance has been 30% Republican and 29% Democratic, with 40% independent.\n\nThe entire questionnaire, methodology statement, full results and breakdowns by demographic groups are available at law.marquette.edu/poll/results-and-data.\n\nAbout Kevin Conway\n\nKevin is the associate director for university communication in the Office of University Relations.

        "text": "Will South Korea change course following Yoon\u2019s election loss?\nPresident Yoon Suk Yeol\u2019s conservative People Power Party (PPP) suffered a major setback in South Korea\u2019s parliamentary election held on April 10, 2024. Of the 300 seats in the National Assembly, the PPP secured only 108 seats through direct and proportional elections. Meanwhile, the major progressive opposition Democratic Party of Korea (DPK) and its satellite parties expanded its majority to 175 seats, hampering Yoon\u2019s ability to govern for his remaining three years in office. Although the Yoon government\u2019s domestic agenda may become further imperiled, his active foreign policy agenda will largely stay intact, including his staunch support for the U.S.-South Korea alliance and promotion of South Korea as a global pivotal state.\n\nA referendum on President Yoon\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s midterm election was largely seen as a referendum on Yoon. Since coming to office in May 2022, Yoon\u2019s domestic approval ratings have remained low, rarely breaking past 40 percent. Although support for the DPK and its party leader, Lee Jae-myung, has tracked equally as low, South Koreans were more likely to associate their country\u2019s current economic woes, including inflation and high prices, with the ruling government.\n\nA series of small, but unfortunate events and gaffes by Yoon during the election campaign may have also helped tip the scales in favor of opposition candidates in contested districts. In the months leading up to South Korea\u2019s election, minor scandals surrounding the president\u2019s wife and his former defense minister, an ongoing strike by the country\u2019s medical doctors, and the president\u2019s seemingly trivial comment about the price of green onions made him look out of touch.\n\nMoreover, the rapid growth in support for a new progressive party founded by former Minister of Justice Cho Kuk just a month before the election attests to Yoon\u2019s domestic unpopularity. Cho established the Rebuilding Korea Party (RKP) explicitly to challenge the Yoon administration, which he described as \u201cdictatorial\u201d and \u201canti-democratic.\u201d Despite the former justice minister\u2019s own corruption scandals and indictment, the RKP performed better than any other third party, winning 12 seats in the party-list proportional voting system.\n\nDomestic political challenges\n\nA divided government and ongoing political polarization will make it especially difficult for government and opposition leaders to make compromises and find bold solutions to pressing social and economic problems, such as high inflation, falling birth rates, and the lack of affordable housing.\n\nYoon will continue to face challenges in implementing his domestic priorities. During recent town hall meetings, the president unveiled several policy initiatives in hopes of attracting voters, including plans for new housing through urban redevelopment and new infrastructure projects. Just prior to the election, Yoon promised major investment in a new industrial complex for the development of semiconductors and artificial intelligence and pledged to relocate the National Assembly out of Seoul to the administrative city of Sejong in the middle of the country. However, his government will face obstacles in the National Assembly in financing such projects with progressives holding a commanding majority.\n\nGreater continuity in foreign policy\n\nThe basic contours of Yoon\u2019s foreign and national security policy, including support for the U.S.-South Korean alliance, deterring North Korea, and the U.S.-Japan-Korea trilateral, will persist. Relations with the United States will also remain positive given wide public support, even among progressives, for the U.S.-South Korea alliance.\n\nLikewise, the South Korean public\u2019s unfavorable views of China and broad recognition of Chinese coercive actions in the region have muted major criticism that Yoon has antagonized China. Despite the Yoon government\u2019s close alignment with Washington, Seoul has also maintained space to engage Beijing diplomatically. Last week, the Yoon government announced Seoul would host a China-Japan-South Korea trilateral summit in late May.\n\nNevertheless, the DPK\u2019s electoral gains will take some of the wind out of Yoon\u2019s foreign policy sails. The DPK may complicate further South Korean rapprochement with Japan and demand that Yoon seek greater concessions from Tokyo to address historical grievances. This in turn may slow the pace of U.S.-Japan-Korea trilateral cooperation and the implementation of the deliverables announced during the Camp David trilateral summit in 2023, particularly those that call for greater military cooperation with Japan.\n\nOpposition party members may also feel more emboldened to speak out against Yoon\u2019s hostile approach to North Korea in contrast to the DPK\u2019s desire for greater inter-Korea engagement. Yoon\u2019s revised unification plan for the two Koreas, which incorporates principles of freedom and democracy, will likely be criticized by DPK members.\n\nA lame duck?\n\nThe term \u201clame duck\u201d has been repeatedly used to describe Yoon\u2019s remaining time in office. However, Yoon\u2019s predicament may not significantly diverge from his first two years in office since the DPK did not win a supermajority\u2014over 200 seats\u2014needed to overcome filibusters and override presidential vetoes. The election results are also unlikely to change the overall tenor of South Korea\u2019s polarized politics, as the ruling and opposition parties continue to highlight scandals and pursue corruption charges against their political opponents. Although political momentum may shift to the DPK, the PPP will likely regroup in preparation for the next presidential election in 2027 as it did following even greater losses by the conservative party in the 2020 parliamentary elections.\n\nFor South Korea\u2019s allies and partners, some concern may emerge regarding whether the Yoon government can sustain its activist foreign policy agenda, including support for Ukraine or increased attention to Taiwan and cross-Strait relations. Yoon, however, is unlikely to backtrack on the idea of South Korea becoming a global pivotal state, as foreign policy and national security issues are typically the prerogatives of the president in South Korean politics, and Yoon remains at the helm of Korea\u2019s strong executive branch.\n\nSeoul recently hosted the third Summit for Democracy in March, and in May will co-host the AI Safety Summit and the China-Japan-Korea trilateral summit. NATO is looking toward South Korea and other Asian countries for greater support on Ukraine. Although unlikely, a more inward-looking South Korea resulting from the president\u2019s so-called \u201clame-duck\u201d status would be a loss for the international community.\n\nBeyond partisan politics, the DPK too has a stake in elevating South Korea\u2019s global role. Although North Korea and Japan issues elicit starkly different responses from South Korean progressives and conservatives, in recent years, attitudes towards the U.S.-South Korea alliance and China have somewhat converged. The United States and its allies should therefore continue to work with Seoul, irrespective of the party in power, to promote regional security and global order.",

        "text": "Trump allies encourage Mar-a-Lago visits with foreign leaders months before election\nFormer President Donald Trump's allies have been encouraging foreign countries to send diplomats and official emissaries to Mar-a-Lago to reconnect ahead of another potential Trump stint in the White House, sources with direct knowledge of the meetings confirmed to CBS News.\n\nTrump advisers and allies believe he'll be able to capitalize on the decline in Americans' approval of President Joe Biden's foreign policy decisions. An April CBS News poll found that only 33% of Americans approve of Mr. Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict, down from 44% in October.\n\nIt is rare for foreign ambassadors and ministers to meet with the presumptive GOP presidential nominee half a year before the presidential election and suggests that they're laying the groundwork for another Trump administration.\n\n\"The biggest handle Biden had on Trump was that this guy is unpredictable, especially on the world stage,\" said Terry Sullivan, who ran Sen. Marco Rubio's 2016 presidential campaign. \"When you take your opponent's strength and your personal weakness and turn them on their head, that's a big move.\"\n\nThe 2012 Republican presidential nominee, Sen. Mitt Romney, implemented a similar strategy of meeting foreign leaders shortly before he won the GOP presidential nomination in 2012. On a trip to London for a fundraiser that year, Romney met with several British leaders. At the time, CBS News chief political analyst John Dickerson told \"CBS This Morning\" that Romney's campaign had calibrated his talking points about the meetings to project a presidential aura.\n\n\"It's something every campaign does to some degree if they can get away with it and show they have gravitas and can handle major foreign policy situations,\" said Sullivan, who also worked on Romney's earlier presidential bid in 2008 and is now a CBS News contributor.\n\nForeign leaders have made stops at Trump's Mar-a-Lago Florida club, too. The former president recently hosted British Foreign Secretary David Cameron, whose spokesperson said it was \"standard practice for ministers to meet with opposition candidates as part of their routine international engagement.\" The two spoke about the war in Ukraine, NATO spending and upcoming elections, according to the Trump campaign.\n\nBut unlike recent presidential nominees, Trump has also hosted controversial foreign leaders. The willingness by some Trump advisers to contact these foreign governments reflects the approach another Trump administration could take on foreign policy.\n\nLast month, the former president hosted Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, the closest European Union ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, at Mar-a-Lago. The two also discussed the war in Ukraine, Orban later told state media.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump with Hungarian President Viktor Orb\u00e1n. Screenshot from Orb\u00e1n Facebook video\n\nMr. Biden reacted swiftly, criticizing the rendezvous on the day it took place.\n\n\"You know who he's meeting with today down at Mar-a-Lago? Orb\u00e1n of Hungary, who stated flatly he doesn't think democracy works. He's looking for dictatorship,\" Mr. Biden said at a rally near Philadelphia. \"That's who he's meeting with.\"\n\nTrump also spoke recently with Saudi Arabia's Prince Mohammed bin Salman, The New York Times reported, who was found by U.S. intelligence to have signed off on killing Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi,\" a longtime U.S. resident and Washington Post journalist.\n\nThe former president has also spoken with government officials from other Western countries, including Finland last year, a source familiar with the conversations told CBS News.\n\nThe outreach by Trump's allies to foreign dignitaries was first reported by Politico.\n\nIn a CBS News national poll in March, Trump was leading Mr. Biden, as voters remembered the economy under Trump as being better than it is under the president. The Biden campaign and Democratic National Committee are trying to close the gap by exploiting their considerable financial advantage over the Trump campaign and Republican Party, placing multimillion-dollar ad buys in key battleground states.",

        "text": "Can Independents Vote in U.S. Primaries?\nLearn how independents are disenfranchised from participating in congressional and state primaries across 15 states.\n\nAcross 15 closed primary states, registered independents lack the right to vote in congressional and state primary elections. State parties can establish rules to permit independents to vote in their primaries, but this is rare.\n\nAccording to publicly-available voter registration statistics, there are just over 15.7 million registered independents who lack the right to vote in primary elections in these 15 states. (See full report for a state-by-state breakdown). Further, there are more than 1.8 million voters in closed primary states who are registered with a minor party and are also barred from participating in the major parties\u2019 primaries. A total of 17.6 million registered voters lack a right to participate in taxpayer-funded major party primary elections for congressional and state offices.\n\nThe vast majority of these 17.6 million voters are not just shut out of primaries. Because 85% of congressional districts in closed primary states were \u201csafe\u201d in 2022, most of these voters were effectively left without any voice at the ballot box. The primary election was the consequential contest, and given they couldn\u2019t participated, they were denied both fair representation and a mechanism to hold elected officials accountable.\n\nPresidential Primaries and Caucuses\n\nThe problem with closed primaries is even worse at the presidential level. While 15 states have closed congressional and state primaries, an additional seven states \u2014 for a total of 22 \u2014 hold closed presidential primaries or caucuses. The same rules apply as described above: Independents do not have a legal right to participate in these contests, and their ability to do so is based on the whims of political parties.\n\nIn these 22 states, there are over 23.5 million registered independent voters., There are also about 3.5 million voters registered with minor parties who cannot vote in the major party nominating contests. Combined, a total of 27 million registered voters do not have the right to participate in major party presidential primaries or caucuses.\n\nThe problem with closed primaries has worsened in recent years as more voters register as independents. Consider the following: The 27 million voters who are not registered with a major party represent 28.8% of all registered voters in the 20 states that hold closed presidential primaries or caucuses (and report partisan voter registration data). In 2010, there were just over 18.5 million non-major party voters in these 20 states who represented 24.1% of all registered voters. In a little over a decade, the share of voters who cannot vote in presidential primaries or caucuses without a party\u2019s blessing has increased by nearly 20%. The raw number of eligible voters barred from participating in taxpayer-funded primaries increased by nearly 8.5 million people.\n\nTo learn more about independent voters and the problem with closed primaries, check out The Unite America Institute's recent report, \"Not Invited to the Party Primary.\"",

Identifying areas of concern through the Harvard Youth Poll lets tomorrow\u2019s political leaders get started on ideas, strategies, and solutions, and allows them to decide today what the next generation of political leadership needs to look like.\n\nThe Spring 2024 Harvard Youth Poll surveyed 2,010 young Americans between 18- and 29 years old nationwide, and was conducted between March 14-21, 2024.\n\n\"Young people today have clear concerns about where our country is headed,\" said IOP Director Setti Warren. \"From worries about the economy, foreign policy, immigration, and climate, young people across the country are paying attention and are increasingly prepared to make their voices heard at the ballot box this November.\"\n\n\"As the Biden/Trump rematch takes shape, we see strong levels of engagement and interest in voting among young Americans,\" said John Della Volpe, IOP Polling Director. \"Make no mistake, this is a different youth electorate than we saw in 2020 and 2022, and young voters are motivated by different things. Economic issues are top of mind, housing is a major concern\u2014and the gap between young men's and young women's political preferences is pronounced.\"\n\n\"Young Americans are emerging from a pandemic that has tested our trust in democratic institutions and the bonds that unite us,\" said Anil Cacodcar, Student Chair of the Harvard Public Opinion Project. \"Despite this, young Americans are more ready than ever to engage with these institutions to push for the change we want to see in the world.\"\n\nTen key findings from the 47th in the biannual series are below.",

        "text": "AAAS Welcomes 502 Scientists and Engineers Who Join the Ranks of Fellows\nWashington, D.C. \u2014 The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), one of the world\u2019s largest general scientific societies and publisher of the Science family of journals, announces the 2023 class of AAAS Fellows, a distinguished lifetime honor within the scientific community. This latest class is comprised of 502 scientists, engineers and innovators across 24 AAAS disciplinary Sections. The newly elected Fellows overwhelmingly represent the fields of biological sciences, chemistry, medical sciences and engineering followed by neuroscience and physics. View the 2023 AAAS Fellows class.\n\n\u201cAs we celebrate the 150th anniversary of the AAAS Fellows Program, AAAS is proud to recognize the newly elected individuals. This year\u2019s class embodies scientific excellence, fosters trust in science throughout the communities they serve, and leads the next generation of scientists while advancing scientific achievements,\u201d said Sudip S. Parikh, Ph.D., AAAS chief executive officer and executive publisher of the Science family of journals.\n\nThis year\u2019s Fellows are at the forefront of discussions about emerging technologies, semiconductor production, environmental issues, science education, innovative therapies, and more as the world grapples with societal concerns around these topics. Examples include:\n\nLeading the development of life-saving vaccines and treatments, such as a COVID-19 oral medication, researching tumor viruses and teaching the public about viral diseases.\n\nContributing to active learning methods and development of the first genetic linkage map of the human genome.\n\nLeading the largest all-digital planetarium in the world, transforming how audiences experience the universe, including planetarium documentaries and programming, immersive digital experiences and public engagement.\n\nDeveloping technology for mobile brain imaging and robotic exoskeletons, moving the field of rehabilitation engineering forward.\n\nConducting research about forest carbon cycles and global methane emissions to improve our understanding of air pollution and associated health risks.\n\nPioneering contributions to the anthropology field for reconstructing early hominin paleoecology and fossil discoveries related to the origin of the genus Homo.\n\nPioneering fundamental groundwork and developing tools to solve some of the most perplexing production problems in the plant medicinal alkaloid field.\n\nTeaching and mentoring women and underrepresented minorities on STEMM identity and driving communications policy to increase accessibility for those with hearing loss.\n\nContributing to understanding of hereditary cancer syndromes and health disparities that put underserved populations at high risk of advanced diseases.\n\nBroadening the understanding of scientific labor markets, gender differences in employment \u2014 particularly in academia \u2014 and children's educational outcomes.\n\nThe new class hails from academic institutions, laboratories and observatories, hospitals and medical research centers, museums, corporations, nonprofit organizations, institutes and government agencies.\n\nAAAS first launched this lifetime recognition in 1874, about 25 years after the association was founded. In its 150th year, the AAAS Fellows program is proud to celebrate this new class, which joins the ranks of noted Fellows such as Alondra Nelson, the Harold F. Linder Professor at the Institute for Advanced Study and former deputy assistant to President Joe Biden and acting director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy; Mae Jemison, the first Black woman to go to space; Steven Chu, 1997 Nobel laureate in physics who served as the 12th U.S. Secretary of Energy; W. E. B. Dubois, considered the founding father of American sociology; Ellen Ochoa, veteran astronaut and the Johnson Space Center\u2019s first Hispanic and second female director in its history; Grace Hopper, pioneer in computer software development and programming language; and Vint Cerf, who co-designed the TCP/IP protocols and the architecture of the Internet and received the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nThe new Fellows will receive a certificate and a gold and blue rosette pin (representing science and engineering, respectively) to commemorate their election and will be celebrated at a forum on September 21, 2024. That evening, AAAS will also celebrate the program\u2019s 150th anniversary at the National Building Museum in Washington, D.C. The 2023 Fellows class will also be featured in the AAAS News & Notes section of the journal Science in April 2024.\n\nAdditional background on the AAAS Fellows program:\n\nAAAS Members can be considered for the rank of Fellow if nominated by the Steering Committees of the association\u2019s 24 sections across scientific and engineering disciplines, by three Fellows who are current AAAS Members, or by the CEO of AAAS. Fellows must have been continuous members of AAAS for four years by the end of the calendar year in which they are elected.\n\nElection as a Fellow of AAAS is a lifetime honor, but it comes with an expectation that recipients maintain commonly held standards of professional ethics and scientific integrity. In the rare case that an elected Fellow no longer meets this expectation or otherwise fails to merit the continued status of Fellow, one or more AAAS Members can participate in a revocation process, which will determine whether the individual\u2019s Fellow status should be rescinded.\n\n# # #\n\nThe American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) is the world\u2019s largest general scientific society and publisher of the journal Science, as well as Science Translational Medicine; Science Signaling; a digital, open-access journal, Science Advances; Science Immunology; and Science Robotics. AAAS was founded in 1848 and includes more than 250 affiliated societies and academies of science, serving 10 million individuals. The nonprofit AAAS is open to all and fulfills its mission to \u201cadvance science and serve society\u201d through initiatives in science policy, international programs, science education, public engagement, and more.

        "text": "Why Is Migration Declining at the U.S.-Mexico Border in Early 2024?\nThe number of migrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border has dropped sharply during the first months of 2024. It is very rare to see migration decline from winter to spring, but that, so far, is what appears to be happening.\n\nIn brief:\n\nThe most significant reason points to a Mexican government crackdown on people transiting the country, which is bringing increasing reports of harm to migrants. Large numbers of people are currently bottled up throughout Mexico.\n\nThis is unsustainable. Past patterns, and current data from countries through which U.S.-bound migrants transit, tell us that the early 2024 migration drop will be temporary.\n\nAt the same time, a hard look at the numbers makes clear that the Texas state government\u2019s hardline policies do not explain the decline and do not offer a way forward.\n\nHigh levels of migration at the border are likely to resume in the medium term. Once that happens, migration will again appear unmanaged and the Biden administration may be tempted to \u201cshut down\u201d asylum access at the border as he has suggested. This would be a mistake: it would inflict grave harm on thousands of people, while any resulting drop in migration would\u2014as with all past crackdowns\u2014be only temporary. It also would violate U.S. and international law.\n\nInstead of more crackdowns with temporary results, the U.S. government needs to overhaul a border security and immigration system that lags badly behind the growth\u2014over the past decade\u2014in migrants seeking protection. There is an urgent need to increase funding for the processing of asylum claims at the border, the management of cases while asylum seekers await trial, and efficient adjudication of those cases.\n\nA system that dedicates fewer than 725 judges to a backlog of 3 million cases is unsustainable. The U.S. government needs to invest in an immigration and asylum system that is faster, fairer, and more humane. The situation at the border is not a crisis, it\u2019s an administrative problem.\n\nA sharp drop over three months\n\nDecember 2023 was a record month at the U.S.-Mexico border. The U.S. Border Patrol apprehended migrants 249,737 times, the most of any month for which public monthly records exist ( since 2000). Another 52,244 people came to land-border ports of entry, most of them with appointments to seek protection, which they made using Customs and Border Protection\u2019s \u201cCBP One\u201d smartphone app. Taken together, at least two-thirds of December\u2019s migrants turned themselves in to U.S. authorities.\n\nWhat happened after December was surprising: migration plummeted. Border Patrol\u2019s January 2024 apprehensions dropped 50 percent from December. It was the steepest month-to-month drop in the nearly 25 years for which we have data. And migration levels remained similarly low in February and March of this year.\n\nData table\n\nWhile still greater than the past 15 years\u2019 norm, January, February, and March 2024 have seen the third, seventh, and eighth fewest Border Patrol migrant apprehensions of the Biden administration\u2019s 38 months in office.\n\nEspecially unusual is the decline in migration persisting into March, with apprehensions actually dropping 2 percent from February. With its milder weather, springtime is usually a moment of increasing migration to the U.S.-Mexico border. This is only the second time this century that migration has declined from February to March.\n\nMigration may still be declining now, in April. Rep. Henry Cu\u00e9llar (D-Texas), the ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Homeland Security Subcommittee, said at an April 10 hearing that Border Patrol had averaged 3,800 apprehensions per day over the previous three weeks. If April 2024 were to keep that pace, it would be the third-lightest month of the Biden administration\u2019s 39 full months.\n\nOften, such sharp drops accompany changes in U.S. policy. But there have been no policy changes, just unsuccessful legislation and talk of possible executive action to \u201cshut down\u201d access to asylum at the border. What explains the drop in migration?\n\nMexico cracks down on migrants again\n\nMost of the answer lies with Mexico. Two days after Christmas 2023, near the end of the border\u2019s record-breaking December, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas visited Mexico City and met with President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador and other Mexican officials.\n\nShortly after Blinken and Makorkas\u2019s trip, observers noted a sharp increase in the tempo of Mexican security and migration forces\u2019 operations to interdict migrants. National Guard, military, and National Migration Institute (INM) personnel established new checkpoints on main roads. They increased patrols in known transit areas. They began pulling more people off of northbound freight trains. They set up a camp at a site east of San Diego where asylum seekers had been crossing in large numbers. They deployed hundreds of personnel to Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez.\n\nIn January and February, Mexico\u2019s migration forces shattered their single-month migrant apprehensions record (97,969 apprehensions in November 2023), stopping 120,005 migrants in January and 119,943 in February. (Mexico hasn\u2019t reported March data yet.)\n\nData table\n\nWhile Mexico has reported 240,000 migrant apprehensions in January and February, it reports deporting just 6,555 of them during those months. Recent laws and court rulings generally prohibit Mexico from detaining migrant children, or holding adult migrants in detention for more than 36 hours (though it does happen). Instead of detaining or deporting, Mexico\u2019s government appears to be massively busing apprehended migrants away from its northern border, sending them to destinations deep in the country\u2019s interior or back to the southern border.\n\nMexican forces\u2019 stepped-up operations have come with more allegations of abuse. \u201cAt least 55\u201d migrants detained in Torre\u00f3n, Coahuila on April 8, \u201cincluding women and children, reported that the agents detained them for several hours, beat them, and stole money, cell phones, and documents before releasing them,\u201d reported La Jornada. In Empalme, Sonora on April 5, Mexican soldiers threatened humanitarian workers who were offering assistance to migrants near the local railroad tracks, according to the Sonora-based Proyecto Puente. An April 10 communiqu\u00e9 from 49 Mexican human rights groups detailed abuse allegations in Chihuahua: National Migration Institute (INM) agents roughing up a migrant while trying to keep a reporter from filming; abandoning 55 people, including children, at a gas station; and chasing a large group of people, including children, from a train station.\n\nWhile Mexico has slowed the flow of migrants for a few months, its crackdown is far from a long-term solution. People hoping to turn themselves in to U.S. authorities are now backed up throughout Mexico. This is clear with the jump in wait times for CBP One appointments, as the agency refuses any further increases to the number of appointments available to protection-seeking migrants at land-border ports of entry.\n\nData Table\n\nA March 1 report from the University of Texas\u2019s Strauss Center reported that CBP One wait times were reaching six months at some ports of entry. Now, Human Rights First advocates visiting Nogales this week report CBP One wait times of seven to eight months. (To make an appointment, users must be in a geographic area of Mexico that is north of, or including, Mexico City\u2019s latitude.)\n\nWhile all this happens, organized crime is getting more predatory. WOLA reported this month that migrants awaiting CBP One appointments in Mexico\u2019s border state of Tamaulipas face high, and increasing, probabilities of being kidnapped for ransom, assaulted, raped, and tortured by violent criminal groups.\n\nThe drop in migration is temporary\n\nMost of the northbound migrants whom Mexican forces have stopped remain \u201cbottled up\u201d or stranded inside Mexico. This is obviously unsustainable: the dam that Mexico has built up cannot hold for very long and while some are opting to settle in Mexico, many more continue to have the U.S. as their destination.\n\nMore people continue to enter Mexico from the south, judging from the Panamanian and Honduran governments\u2019 data about migrants transiting their countries. As of March 31, Panama had registered 109,069 people transiting the treacherous Dari\u00e9n Gap, a 14 percent increase over the first three months of 2023. Honduras registered 133,518 migrants passing through its territory during the first three months of 2024, 120 percent more than the same period in 2023.\n\nThe most prominent nationality is citizens of Venezuela, who make up 64 percent of people registered in Panama and 47 percent of those registered in Honduras. All three countries\u2014Mexico (even without March data), Honduras, and Panama\u2014have encountered far more Venezuelan migrants so far this year than the United States has. This tells us that Venezuelans\u2014like many other nationalities\u2014are currently bottlenecked in Mexico.\n\nMexico, a middle-income country with important security and governance challenges and a presidential election in June, can\u2019t contain this many unrooted people \u201cin limbo\u201d for a long period. At some point, Mexico\u2019s containment may falter, and large numbers of people will resume arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nTexas\u2019s policies don\u2019t seem to explain it\n\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott (R), a vocal critic of the Biden administration\u2019s border policies, has been claiming credit for the 2024 drop in migration. Abbott argues that his expenditure of about $10 billion in state funds on tough border security measures has deterred migrants, and in particular deterred them from coming to the Texas part of the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThe data so far don\u2019t quite back that up.\n\nGov. Abbott launched \u201cOperation Lone Star\u201d in March 2021, initiating what would become National Guard and police deployments, thousands of \u201ctrespassing\u201d arrests of migrants, wall-building, busing of migrants to Democratic-governed cities, and other measures. One of Abbott\u2019s greatest escalations took place in June-July 2023, when he ordered a \u201cwall\u201d of buoys built in the Rio Grande and installed dozens of miles of concertina wire on the riverbank.\n\nThe deterrent effect of all of this was null. Migrant encounters in Texas hit their highest point of the Biden administration in September 2023 and almost matched it again in December 2023.\n\nData table\n\nMigration has fallen in Texas since January, but the same happened in the first months of 2023, with almost identical numbers of migrant encounters a year ago. In March 2024, Texas made up 42 percent of all border migrant encounters. That\u2019s the lowest level of the Biden administration\u2014but it is not a big drop from the 46 percent of encounters that was Texas\u2019s share a year earlier, in March 2023.\n\nGov. Abbott\u2019s escalations of \u201cOperation Lone Star\u201d have had little to no correlative effect on migration flows to Texas. It is possible, however, that Texas\u2019s harsh new state immigration law, SB4, currently blocked in court, could cool migration in Texas for a few months, as some migrants and smugglers avoid that state as they \u201cwait and see\u201d how the law will be implemented.\n\nDenying asylum access won\u2019t work\n\nCracking down on migration, as Mexico and Texas are attempting, only reduces migration in the short term. If the numbers start rising again, U.S. policymakers may look for new ways to crack down. Those won\u2019t work beyond the short term either.\n\nThe likely next step is already looming. Legislation that failed to pass the Senate in February, and executive action that the Biden White House is considering, would suspend asylum processing when daily migrant encounters reach a certain threshold. \u201cWhen the border has over 5,000 people a day trying to cross the border because you can\u2019t manage it, slow it up,\u201d President Biden said to Univisi\u00f3n in April.\n\nEven if it survives legal challenges, any new federal efforts to \u201cshut down asylum\u201d at the border would have only a short-term effect on migration flows. People who arrive on U.S. soil will still have a right to due process, adjudication capacity remains woefully inadequate, many migrants now come from very distant countries that make deportation too costly to carry out massively, some governments refuse to receive deportation flights, and Mexico simply cannot\u2014and will not\u2014take back that many non-Mexican returnees.\n\nDuring the first six months of fiscal 2024, 41 percent of migrants encountered at the U.S.-Mexico border\u2014549,270 people\u2014came from countries farther away than Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean. Immigration and Customs Enforcement ICE currently runs about 30 removal flights to such countries each month. Even if the United States lost touch with its basic values and severely curtailed asylum access, there wouldn\u2019t be enough ICE planes to expel the vast majority of migrants, or a budget to pay for them.\n\nThe same would be true if Donald Trump were president again. \u201cShutting down asylum\u201d is not a long-term plan.\n\nThe U.S. government can solve this\n\nThe U.S. commitment to the right to seek asylum dates back to the decades after World War II. Most Americans would never want to go back to a past where we turned people away to likely deaths, without even offering them a hearing. An important number of today\u2019s asylum seekers\u2014 at least a quarter, counting cases that get closed\u2014win asylum or other protection in the United States, even with limitations in access to legal counsel and vast geographic differences in asylum approval rates. To \u201cshut down\u201d asylum would be to send hundreds of thousands of people per year back to very likely harm.\n\nThe situation at the border is not a \u201ccrisis,\u201d it is an administrative problem. It requires the U.S. government to reform its border and migration apparatus to conform with reality.\n\nAdjusting to the new reality\u2014adjudicating protection claims fairly but more efficiently\u2014requires:\n\nMore processing capacity at the border , including more CBP One appointments and opportunities for urgent \u201cwalk-ups\u201d at ports of entry. CBP and Border Patrol need more facilities to bring people to be processed and to begin asylum claims, staffed by people who don\u2019t need law enforcement training.\n\n, including more CBP One appointments and opportunities for urgent \u201cwalk-ups\u201d at ports of entry.

More case management to ensure that asylum applicants remain in the system and have access to services.\n\nto ensure that asylum applicants remain in the system and have access to services. More asylum officers and immigration judges. It is a travesty that, a decade after the number of asylum seekers started to increase at the border, the Department of Justice Executive Office for Immigration Review has only 725 judges to hear nearly 3 million cases\u2014and that this workforce declined slightly since September 2023.\n\nThe U.S. government urgently needs to invest in these priorities. It makes no sense to expect lulls in migration, like we\u2019re seeing right now, to be permanent. Migration has bounced back from numerous crackdowns over the past 10 years. The early 2024 decline is not a \u201cnew normal,\u201d because nothing has been fixed.",

        "text": "Biden-Harris Administration Finalizes Strategy to Guide Balanced Management, Conservation of Public Lands\nDate: Thursday, April 18, 2024\n\nContact: Interior_Press@ios.doi.gov\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Department of the Interior today announced a final rule to help guide the balanced management of America\u2019s public lands. The final Public Lands Rule provides tools for the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to help improve the health and resilience of public lands in the face of a changing climate; conserve important wildlife habitat and intact landscapes; facilitate responsible development; and better recognize unique cultural and natural resources on public lands.\n\nThe Public Lands Rule builds on historic investments in public lands, waters and clean energy deployment provided by President Biden\u2019s Investing in America agenda, which recognizes the critical value of our public lands to all Americans. It also complements the President\u2019s America the Beautiful initiative, a 10-year, locally led and nationally scaled effort to protect, conserve, connect and restore the lands, waters and wildlife upon which we all depend.\n\nBuilding on decades of land management experience and emphasizing the use of science and data, including Indigenous Knowledge, to guide balanced decision-making, the rule applies the existing fundamentals of land health across BLM programs, establishes restoration and mitigation leases, and clarifies practices to designate and protect Areas of Critical Environmental Concern (ACECs). The rule will help to ensure the BLM continues to protect land health while managing other uses of the public lands, such as clean energy development and outdoor recreation.\n\n\u201cAs stewards of America\u2019s public lands, the Interior Department takes seriously our role in helping bolster landscape resilience in the face of worsening climate impacts. Today\u2019s final rule helps restore balance to our public lands as we continue using the best-available science to restore habitats, guide strategic and responsible development, and sustain our public lands for generations to come,\u201d said Secretary Deb Haaland. \u201cComplemented with historic investments from President Biden\u2019s Investing in America agenda, we are implementing enduring changes that will benefit wildlife, communities and habitats.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s public lands are our national treasures and need to be managed and made resilient for future generations of Americans,\u201d said John Podesta, Senior Advisor to the President for International Climate Policy. \u201cToday\u2019s final rule from the Department of the Interior is a huge win for ensuring balance on our public lands, helping them withstand the challenges of climate change and environmental threats like invasive species, and making sure they continue to provide services to the American people for decades to come.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Interior Department is ensuring our public lands are managed with an eye to future generations, complementing President Biden\u2019s ambitious conservation agenda,\u201d said White House Council on Environmental Quality Chair Brenda Mallory. \u201cFrom the most rugged backcountry spots to popular close-to-home recreation areas, these reforms will help deliver cleaner water, healthier lands, abundant wildlife, and more recreation opportunities for all of us.\u201d\n\nThe final rule comes amid growing pressures and historic challenges facing land managers. The impacts of climate change\u2014including prolonged drought, increasing wildfires, and an influx of invasive species\u2014pose increasing risks to communities, wildlife and ecosystems. The Public Lands Rule will help the BLM navigate changing conditions on the ground, while helping public lands continue to serve as economic drivers across the West.\n\n\u201cThe BLM received and considered over 200,000 comments on the proposed rule from individuals, state, Tribal and local governments, industry groups and advocacy organizations, which led to important improvements in this final rule,\u201d said Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management Dr. Steve Feldgus. \u201cContinued broad collaboration with this diverse group of partners will be key to our implementation of this rule to ensure that our public lands are being managed for all Americans.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur public lands provide wildlife habitat and clean water, the energy that lights our homes, the wood we build with, and the places where we make family memories,\u201d said BLM Director Tracy Stone-Manning. \u201cThis rule honors our obligation to current and future generations to help ensure our public lands and waters remain healthy amid growing pressures and change.\u201d\n\nThe final rule clarifies and refines concepts first proposed in April 2023. The BLM provided a 90-day comment period on this rule, holding five public meetings and receiving over 200,000 comments, the vast majority of which supported the effort. In response to the substantive comments received, the BLM clarified and refined concepts laid out in the proposed rule.\n\nThe final rule:\n\nDirects BLM to manage for landscape health. Successful public land management that delivers natural resources, wildlife habitat and clean water requires a thorough understanding of the health and condition of the landscape, especially as conditions shift on the ground due to climate change. To help sustain the health of our lands and waters, the rule directs the BLM to manage public land uses in accordance with the fundamentals of land health, which will help watersheds support soils, plants, and water; ecosystems provide healthy populations and communities of plants and animals; and wildlife habitats on public lands protect threatened and endangered species consistent with the multiple use and sustained yield framework.\n\nSuccessful public land management that delivers natural resources, wildlife habitat and clean water requires a thorough understanding of the health and condition of the landscape, especially as conditions shift on the ground due to climate change.

Provides a mechanism for restoring and protecting our public lands through restoration and mitigation leases. Restoration leases provide greater clarity for the BLM to work with appropriate partners to restore degraded lands. Mitigation leases will provide a clear and consistent mechanism for developers to offset their impacts by investing in land health elsewhere on public lands, like they currently can on state and private lands. The final rule clarifies who can obtain a restoration or mitigation lease, limiting potential lessees to qualified individuals, businesses, non-governmental organizations, Tribal governments, conservation districts, or state fish and wildlife agencies. Restoration and mitigation leases will not be issued if they would conflict with existing authorized uses.\n\nRestoration leases provide greater clarity for the BLM to work with appropriate partners to restore degraded lands.

The final rule provides greater detail about how the BLM will continue to follow the direction in the Federal Land Policy and Management Act to prioritize the designation and protection of ACECs. Following public comments, the final rule clarifies how BLM consideration of new ACEC nominations and temporary management options does not interfere with the BLM\u2019s discretion to continue advancing pending project applications.\n\nThe Public Lands Rule complements the BLM\u2019s recently announced final Renewable Energy Rule, providing consistent direction and new tools for mitigation, helping advance the efficient and environmentally responsible development of renewable energy on BLM-managed public lands, providing greater clarity and consistency in permitting, and allowing for the continued acceleration of project reviews and approvals, while managing public lands under the principles of multiple use and sustained yield.\n\nThe final rule will publish in the Federal Register in the coming days.\n\n###",

She called Mr Trump \"the most anti-democratic president in American history\" and said he was spreading \"dangerous conspiracy theories\" that would have horrified her father.\n\n\"We want to make crystal clear our feeling that the best way forward for America is to re-elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to four more years,\" she said.\n\nWatch: Kennedy family endorses Joe Biden for president in snub of RFK Jr\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is expected to face Mr Biden, a Democrat, in November as the Republican nominee.\n\nA number of relatives have opposed Mr Kennedy Jr's campaign from the start, and members of the family, which has deep roots in Ireland, visited Mr Biden at the White House on St Patrick's Day.\n\nAllow Twitter content?

Among the group endorsing Mr Biden is Joe Kennedy III, a former congressman who serves as the Biden administration's special envoy to Northern Ireland for economic affairs.\n\nAlthough the influence of the Kennedys has declined this century, few families have had such a marked effect on US politics. Mr Kennedy Jr counts a president and senator among his uncles, and in 1968 his father was assassinated while running for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nMr Kennedy Jr had a career as an environmental lawyer before leading the anti-vaccine campaign group Children's Health Defense, which saw its profile and donations soar during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nIn a post on X, Mr Kennedy Jr wrote: \"I hear some of my family will be endorsing President Biden today. I am pleased they are politically active - it's a family tradition. We are divided in our opinions but united in our love for each other.\"\n\nHe noted that several other family members are working for his campaign, which is managed by his daughter-in-law, Amaryllis Fox Kennedy.\n\nMr Kennedy Jr said his presidential run was about \"healing America - healing our economy, our chronic disease crisis, our middle class, our environment, and our standing in the world as a peaceful nation.\"\n\nPolls indicate Mr Kennedy Jr is the most popular of a number of third-party and independent candidates who also have entered the race, and could potentially pick up enough votes to affect the results in several states, although it's unclear whom he might hurt more - Mr Biden or Mr Trump.\n\nHis most immediate challenge in the race will be getting his name on the ballot. The campaign says it has met the requirements to qualify for the ballot in nine states, with efforts underway in most others.\n\nOn Thursday, the campaign said it had qualified in Michigan after Mr Kennedy Jr was nominated by the Natural Law Party - a minor party whose presidential candidate received less than 3,000 votes in the state in 2020.\n\nIn most states, qualifying as an independent candidate means collecting thousands of signatures. Experts say the process can cost millions of dollars. Mr Kennedy Jr's vice presidential running mate, Nicole Shanahan, recently gave the campaign $2m, according to an election filing.\n\nThe Democratic Party has already mounted a legal challenge, arguing that a political action committee supporting the Kennedy campaign is not allowed to help collect those signatures.\n\nDemocrats have also tried to link Mr Kennedy Jr to Mr Trump, playing up the fact that major Trump donor Timothy Mellon is also the biggest donor to a political action committee supporting the Kennedy campaign.\n\nMr Trump, meanwhile, has praised Mr Kennedy Jr. In a post on Truth Social he wrote: \"He is Crooked Joe Biden's Political Opponent, not mine. I love that he is running!\"\n\nAt the same time, some Trump supporters have grown concerned he poses a threat and have emphasised Mr Kennedy Jr's views on the environment and other issues in an attempt to paint him as a far-left radical.",

        "text": "President Joe Biden visits Philadelphia as battle for Pennsylvania heats up ahead of 2024 election\nPHILADELPHIA (CBS) -- The battle for Pennsylvania is heating up as President Joe Biden hit the campaign trail in Philadelphia, just days after former President Donald Trump visited the swing state.\n\nThe candidates have made four campaign stops in Pennsylvania in the last five days.\n\nTrump held a rally in Lehigh County last weekend before President Biden crisscrossed the state this week.\n\nWith more than six months until Election Day, there are still a lot of questions, challenges and hurdles the candidates have to face.\n\nDuring Thursday's visit to Philly, Biden was endorsed by members of the Kennedy family at the Martin Luther King Jr. Rec Center in North Philadelphia.\n\nKerry Kennedy says despite the fact that her brother, Robert Kennedy Jr., is running against Biden as an independent \u2013 she and about a dozen other members of the Kennedy family are backing Biden in 2024.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, second from right, and members of the Kennedy family including Maxwell Kennedy Sr., from left, Kerry Kennedy and Christopher Kennedy walk on stage at a campaign event, Thursday, April 18, 2024, in Philadelphia. Alex Brandon / AP\n\n\"He personifies the values that my father envisioned, that President [John F.] Kennedy envisioned, of decency, of democracy, of human rights, of civil rights. And that's why we're for him,\" Kerry Kennedy said.\n\nRobert Kennedy Jr.'s independent campaign is one of the big question marks heading into what's expected to be a tight 2024 race.\n\nTrump, who visited the Lehigh Valley last Saturday, is dealing with a slew of legal issues, and experts say both Trump and Biden are facing serious voter fatigue.\n\n\"We're seeing, certainly in our work at the Committee of Seventy, a lot of, 'I don't like my choices. I don't like either of these candidates. I can't believe we're doing this again,'\" Lauren Cristella, of the Committee of Seventy, a nonprofit, said.\n\nThrough the primary season, Biden has also seen an impact over his handling of Israel's conflict in Gaza at the polls. Nearly 19% of Minnesota Democrats voted \"uncommitted\" in that state's primary.\n\nIn Michigan, the \"uncommitted\" vote topped 13% and protesters followed Biden to North Philly on Thursday.\n\n\"As long as you guys are going to fund wars and not feed babies, then we're gonna vote uncommitted,\" a protester said.\n\nCristella says while Pennsylvania doesn't have \"uncommitted\" boxes on its ballots, she believes there will be some form of protest through write-ins or no-votes. The question is \u2013 will this carry into November?\n\n\"There's a lot of time between now and November, and I think some people want to register their disapproval, but might ultimately come back home,\" Cristella said.\n\nBiden speaks in Scranton, Pittsburgh\n\nOn Tuesday, April 16, Biden traveled to his birthplace of Scranton, Pennsylvania, where he discussed the economy and proposed higher taxes for the wealthy at the Carpenters Training Center.\n\nThen on Wednesday, the president visited the Pittsburgh headquarters of the United Steelworkers union, where he pledged to block the acquisition of U.S. Steel by Japanese company Nippon Steel.\n\nBiden promised that U.S. Steel would remain an American company while taking aim at his likely GOP challenger for the White House, former President Donald Trump.\n\n\"Taken together, these are strategic and targeted actions that are going to protect American workers and ensure fair competition,\" Biden said. \"Meanwhile, my predecessor and the MAGA Republicans want across-the-board tariffs on all imports, from all countries that could badly hurt American consumers.\"\n\nBiden also said he'd push for the U.S. trade representative to triple the tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum imports.\n\nFourth Biden visit to Philadelphia area, Delaware Valley this year\n\nPresident Biden has committed significant time to visiting the Keystone State already this year, particularly the Philadelphia area and surrounding Delaware Valley. Thursday's visit marks the fourth time he's traveled to the region in 2024.\n\nWith Pennsylvania shaping up to be a battleground for Biden and Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, the president and First Lady Jill Biden traveled to Montgomery County Community College in Blue Bell in January to mark the third anniversary of the Capitol insurrection.\n\nA week later Biden visited stores in the Lehigh Valley to highlight the value of small businesses and talk up his economic record.\n\nAnd on March 9, Biden ramped up his 2024 election campaign with a speech at Strath Haven Middle School in Delaware County, his first rally on the heels of the State of the Union.\n\nDuring that speech, Biden laid out his plans for a second term, vowing to protect reproductive rights, touting his record on the economy and calling for a ban on assault rifles.\n\nBiden and Trump, already the presumptive Democratic and Republican nominees, are widely expected to win their respective primary races in Pennsylvania on April 23.",

        "text": "Election 2024: Kennedy family endorses Biden for president in Philly\nFollowing the endorsement event, President Biden joined Joe Kennedy III, who currently serves as Biden\u2019s special envoy to Northern Ireland, and local supporters at a campaign door-knocking and phone bank training.\n\nThere, Joe Kennedy introduced Biden, telling the volunteers, \u201cYou got a dad, you got a brother, you got a public servant before us that know what it means to lead with a heart on the sleeve.\u201d\n\nBiden \u201cknows that this moment isn\u2019t actually about him, it\u2019s about our country,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about [the] choice that we make now that Philadelphia and Pennsylvania will get to make in such a big, bold way. And that starts with a knock on the door. It starts with a phone call. It starts with the postcard. It starts with listening to a neighbor and asking a question about what concerns them and how we can help and what we together can do to make sure that Joe Biden is going to be there for us, because he\u2019s with us.\u201d\n\nBiden then told the room that Pennsylvania would have a key role to play in the election and that Trump was dedicated to overturning Biden\u2019s key legislative successes.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s committed to be opposed to \u2014 not just figuratively, literally \u2014 everything you\u2019ve helped me get done,\u201d he said. \u201cSo what you\u2019re doing here is bigger than me, bigger than you, bigger than all of us combined. It\u2019s about what kind of country our kids are going to live in. Not because I\u2019m running, not Joe Biden, I mean that sincerely. Not because of me, but because of the option.\u201d\n\nThe Kennedys have been a fixture in Democratic politics for most of the last several decades, with at least one Kennedy serving in a federal elected office between 1947 and 2011, the pinnacle of that being John F. Kennedy\u2019s election to president in 1963. Biden was a senior in high school that year and has often cited JFK as one of his inspirations throughout his political career. Biden is the second Catholic to serve as president, with Kennedy being the first.\n\nBiden also served alongside the \u201cLiberal Lion\u201d of the Senate, Ted Kennedy. However, the memory of Ted Kennedy\u2019s effort to primary President Jimmy Carter in 1979 is widely accepted as one reason the incumbent president lost to the Republican nominee, then-California Governor Ronald Reagan, who went on to serve two terms in the White House.\n\nThe question is now whether Robert Kennedy Jr.\u2019s third-party run will similarly spoil Biden\u2019s chance of reelection.\n\nGiven the tightness of the race and judging by recent polling, it\u2019s a valid concern. For example, in a recent CNN poll, in a head-to-head matchup between Biden and Trump among Pennsylvania voters, the two are in an even tie. However, adding a third party shifts the odds by two points in the Republican candidate\u2019s favor, with RFK Jr. walking away with 16% of the vote and Trump with the state\u2019s coveted 19 electoral votes.\n\nBiden won Pennsylvania with just over 1% of the vote in 2020.\n\nRFK Jr.\u2019s positions read much like a standard Democratic Party platform. An environmental lawyer for more than 20 years, he advocates for green policies such as more sustainable agriculture and energy production practices. He wants to increase the national minimum wage, expand free child care programs, and go after companies that illegally bust up unions. He also favors increasing opportunities for immigrants to enter the country legally, calling the southern U.S. border a \u201chumanitarian crisis.\u201d\n\nHowever, he has previously questioned anti-COVID practices and linked vaccines to autism, key issues that separate him from the Democratic Party and even his own family. His positions on health care, including reproductive rights, have also been somewhat amorphous.",

Alongside these more result-dependent election-year plays, there are also stocks that, irrespective of who wins in November, stand to gain over the next four years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLook at these three election-year stocks and see why each may be a buy ahead of November.\n\nGeo Group (GEO)\n\nOperated by the for-profit prison company The GEO Group. GEO stock.\n\nSource: JosephRouse / Shutterstock\n\nGeo Group (NYSE:GEO) lost big when the Democrats won back the White House in the 2020 Presidential elections. Shortly after his inauguration, President Biden issued an executive order that phased out the use of private prison operators like Geo to manage Federal Bureau of Prisons facilities.\n\nWhile not affecting all of Geo\u2019s business, this EO was perceived to threaten this debt-laden company\u2019s prospects. As a result, GEO stock dipped to multi-decade lows. However, since 2021, Geo shares have bounced back in a big way, especially this year.\n\nThe company has won new contracts with other federal agencies. Geo has also been successfully refinancing its outstanding debt. Yet what\u2019s been really pushing GEO higher has been Trump\u2019s poll numbers, which suggest he could win back the White House. GEO could keep rising if this trend continues, as a Republican administration would likely revoke the EO above.\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT)\n\nClose top view of a Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35C Lightning II with afterburner on\n\nSource: ranchorunner / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for one of the bipartisan election-year stocks, look no further than Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT). After the election, the occupant of the White House could change, but what will not change is the continued increase in geopolitical strife.\n\nThis includes growing tensions between the U.S. and China and the Russia-Ukraine and Mideast conflicts. With defense spending by the U.S. and its Western allies set to keep rising, leading defense contractor Lockheed Martin is likely to continue delivering fiscal results that exceed expectations.\n\nStory Continues",

Before Trump selected him to be RNC chair, Whatley worked on election integrity initiatives as the chair of the North Carolina Republican Party.\n\nHis history with these efforts was a motivating factor for Trump when he selected him to succeed Ronna McDaniel as party chair.\n\nThe announcement underscores an effort by the former president to refocus the RNC on election integrity, which Trump felt previous party leaders failed to accomplish during the 2020 election.\n\nDespite Trump's focus on the issue, there was no evidence of widespread fraud during the 2020 election. Trump is currently facing federal and state charges related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee accused the Trump political operation of trying to undermine the results of the 2024 presidential election.\n\n\"Donald Trump knows he's running a losing campaign, so he's working with his handpicked team of election deniers at the RNC to once again lay the groundwork to undermine our democracy and spread baseless lies about a rigged election,\" said DNC Rapid Response Director Alex Floyd in a press release.",

        "text": "A Presidential Age Limit Is Not the Solution\nThis election year, we must make a choice between 77-year-old Donald Trump and 81-year-old Joe Biden. It is safe to say that neither of these candidates are in their prime, and many Americans have unfavorable opinions about both candidates. Opposition to these candidates has a range of justifications, but one common argument is that they are too old. A 2023 poll by Pew Research Center finds that 82 percent of Republicans and 76 percent of Democrats are in favor of putting a maximum age limit in place for elected officials in Washington, D.C.\n\nHowever, placing any age limit \u2014 yes, even the current minimum age limit \u2014 that determines who is eligible to run for office has, in my opinion, concerning implications that alter the democratic nature of America. Furthermore, it would require amending the constitution, a feat that has not been achieved since 1992, largely because of the supermajority that amending would necessitate.\n\nTo disqualify people over a certain age from running for president would be to label them as a \u201csecond class citizen.\u201d Placing any age limitation beyond the requirement of being an adult on government officials implies that people from certain age groups are deserving of higher-class citizenship. Any adult citizen in the United States should be allowed equal protection under the same democratic principles as their peers, and citing somebody\u2019s age as a reason for not having the same allowances, such as running for president, is undemocratic in nature. If the American public does not see an 81-year-old as fit for the presidency, then they should exercise their right to vote and make their voices heard.\n\nAdditionally, I believe that forcing an age limit on politicians would indicate a mistrust in the American people\u2019s ability to make their own decisions. This applies to the age minimum, as well. Years of experience and demonstrated maturity might mean that older candidates will still win their respective offices, but if a 20-year-old wants to run for office, then the American people should decide whether they want that representation. The point of a representative democracy is that the citizens of a given nation should vote for government officials who represent their ideas and beliefs in government. Reducing the options that the citizenry has to choose from limits their ability to make authentic decisions regarding their representatives.\n\nStill, the shockingly bipartisan conclusion from the Pew Research Center\u2019s poll shows that the American people are tired of our elderly elected officials. While I disagree with the idea of placing a maximum age limit and with the presumption that it would even be possible to achieve said limitations, I do agree that we need to see more young people in government. As many have noted, mental fitness is vital for the presidency. One of our Founding Fathers, Alexander Hamilton, explicitly stated that \u201cenergy in the executive is the leading character in the definition of good government.\u201d If our presidents do not have the mental fitness to be energetic, then they should not be the proud faces of our nation. However, finding a way to test the mental fitness of our presidents would be tricky, given the relative objectivity of such a qualification; therefore, it is up to the voters of any given election to unite in making this determination.\n\nPlacing a maximum age limit on politicians would require a constitutional amendment, and while over three-fourths of both Democrats and Republicans agree that our politicians are too old, according to Pew Research Center, that does not mean that a supermajority of congressional leaders would agree. In fact, I believe that it would be highly unlikely for our legislature to reach the necessary two-thirds majority needed to even propose an amendment to the constitution. As of 2021, the average age of a member of Congress was 58.4 years and 64.3 years for the House of Representatives and Senate, respectively. While that certainly does not qualify the current Congress as elderly, their right to serve unlimited terms as members of Congress means that they would not likely disqualify themselves from holding their offices in the future.\n\nThere are many reasons why older people tend to win primary elections and obtain a seat on the ballot; one is that primaries tend to have voters that overrepresent older populations. In both Republican and Democratic primaries, younger people are underrepresented relative to their district demographics. A solution to this issue would be for more young people to exercise their right to vote in primary elections. Many states \u2014 Rhode Island being the most recent \u2014 even allow seventeen-year-olds turning eighteen in time for the general election to vote in primaries. Young people should take advantage of this opportunity and vote for younger representatives in primary elections.\n\nIncumbency and the advantage of experience also lead to older people dominating the American government. While Joe Biden, for example, is the oldest sitting president in U.S. history, he has also been an active politician since his early days. In fact, his notorious age is ironic when juxtaposed with the fact that he was also one of the youngest U.S. senators ever elected when he won a seat in Delaware at the age of 29. Because of his nearly unbeatable experience, party leaders might be more encouraged to endorse him as a candidate. It seems highly unlikely to me that any other Democrat could have won the primary election in any state this year, since Biden benefits from being the incumbent. So, despite many complaints about his age, it doesn\u2019t really seem like people are willing to do anything about it.\n\nInstead of complaining about the age of many established U.S. politicians, especially ahead of the presidential election in November, I believe that people should exercise their right to vote in all elections, including smaller, local elections. While can be easy to ignore virtually any election besides the general presidential election, raising the voter turnout in primary elections could mean seeing candidates on our ballots who represent the demographic reality of our nation without attempting to make democratically questionable amendments to the U.S. Constitution.",

        "text": "Penn State reminds students to vote in upcoming primary election on April 23\nUNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. \u2014 Penn State students are reminded of the importance of taking part in their civic responsibility to vote and to plan accordingly for the upcoming primary election in Pennsylvania on April 23.\n\nPrimary elections give voters the chance to influence who represents each political party on the November ballot. In Pennsylvania, voters are selecting their party\u2019s candidates for U.S. President and Congress. There are also important state-level primary elections for Pennsylvania\u2019s Attorney General, Auditor General, Treasurer and General Assembly.\n\nCheck your registration and find your polling location.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, all voters have an assigned polling location based on the address they used to register to vote. Visit the PA Voter Registration website to verify that you are registered and to check the address of your assigned polling location.\n\nMake a plan to cast your vote\n\nIf you are voting in-person, check your calendar and schedule time to go to your assigned polling location. Polls are open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Election Day.\n\nIf you requested a Pennsylvania mail-in ballot and still need to return it, follow the instructions that came with your ballot on how to and where to return it. Check dates, times and locations carefully.\n\nLearn about the candidates on your ballot.\n\nVisit Vote411 or Ballotpedia, enter your address and review who will be on your ballot. Take time to learn about the candidates and decide who to vote for by using candidates\u2019 websites or non-partisan resources like the League of Women Voters of Centre County, WPSU or other local newspapers.\n\nIf you have questions about voting in Pennsylvania\u2019s primary elections, visit the Pennsylvania Voter Information website or psuvotes.psu.edu.",

Bennie G. Thompson (D-MS), Ranking Member of the Committee on Homeland Security, introduced the Denying Infinite Security and Government Resources Allocated toward Convicted and Extremely Dishonorable Former Protectees Act or the DISGRACED Former Protectees Act (H.R. 8081). This legislation would reform the U.S. Secret Service\u2019s protective mission by automatically terminating Secret Service protection for those who have been sentenced to prison following conviction for a Federal or State felony\u2014clarifying that prison authorities would be responsible for the protection of all inmates regardless of previous Secret Service protection.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, current law doesn\u2019t anticipate how Secret Service protection would impact the felony prison sentence of a protectee\u2014even a former President. It is regrettable that it has come to this, but this previously unthought-of scenario could become our reality. Therefore, it is necessary for us to be prepared and update the law so the American people can be assured that protective status does not translate into special treatment\u2014and that those who are sentenced to prison will indeed serve the time required of them.\u201d\n\nThis legislation is co-sponsored by Reps. Troy A. Carter Sr., Barbara Lee, Frederica Wilson, Yvette D. Clarke, Bonnie Watson Coleman, Jasmine Crockett, Joyce Beatty, and Steve Cohen.\n\nLink to bill fact sheet\n\nLink to bill text\n\n\n\n# # #",

        "text": "Election 2024: Donald Trump Declines to Fight Aid to Ukraine\nOne of best Sherlock Holmes stories is \u201cThe Adventure of Silver Blaze.\u201d In it, Holmes solves the theft of a prize racehorse by focusing on what didn\u2019t happen rather than what did. In doing so, Holmes (or more precisely, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle) gave us the phrase \u201cthe dog that didn\u2019t bark.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Adventure of Silver Blaze\u201d comes to mind this week as Speaker of the House Mike Johnson moved forward with the long-stalled legislative package that would provide aid to Israel, Taiwan, and Ukraine. The move precipitated a flurry of activity. Johnson divided what had been one bill into four parts, but largely kept the provisions that President Joe Biden has been calling for, particularly those dealing with Ukraine. Johnson also broke new ground by allying with Democrats to get the bills to the floor over the objections of Republicans who oppose aiding Ukraine.\n\nThe House Republicans seeking to block aid to Ukraine were equally active. Georgia Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene vowed to move ahead with her effort to oust Johnson from the speakership, saying she didn\u2019t care if the \u201cspeaker\u2019s office becomes a revolving door.\u201d Representatives Paul Gosar of Arizona and Thomas Massie of Kentucky publicly joined Taylor Greene\u2019s effort. There are rumblings that other Republican House lawmakers will follow suit. The House Freedom Caucus tried to mobilize rank-and-file voters to pressure their elected representatives to oppose Johson\u2019s moves.\n\nThe Water's Edge James M.

The junior senator from Ohio wrote an op-ed for the New York Times arguing that \u201cthe math on Ukraine doesn\u2019t add up.\u201d He then circulated a \u201cfactsheet\u201d to Republican lawmakers on both sides of Capitol Hill that argued that \u201cthe United States faces the same strategic challenge whether or not the 2024 emergency defense supplemental passes: the war in Ukraine consumes far more military mat\u00e9riel than the west can produce, and it costs the lives of far more Ukrainians than Ukraine can mobilize.\u201d\n\nFar more remarkable than this flurry of activity, however, is what hasn\u2019t happened: Donald Trump hasn\u2019t weighed into the debate. Despite repeatedly expressing skepticism about the wisdom of U.S. support for Ukraine and criticizing the way Biden has structured Ukrainian aid, he didn\u2019t try to stop Johnson\u2019s decision to hold a vote. To the contrary, he hosted Johnson at Mar-a-Lago last week and said, \u201cI stand with the speaker.\u201d Trump did complain yesterday on Truth Social about \u201cwhy isn\u2019t Europe giving more money to Ukraine.\u201d (Europe has in fact given Ukraine a considerable amount.) He didn\u2019t mention the Ukraine aid bill, however, let alone urge Republicans to block it.\n\nThat\u2019s quite different from the approach Trump took earlier this year when the Senate voted on a painstakingly negotiated, bipartisan bill to boost security on the U.S. southern border. Then Trump jumped into the fray with both feet, demanding that Republicans kill the bill. They did.\n\nOnly Trump knows why he hasn\u2019t weighed into the Ukraine debate in a similar fashion. Perhaps he is distracted by the start of his criminal trial in New York. Or perhaps he was persuaded during his recent conversation with Polish President Andrzej Duda, whom he calls \u201cmy friend,\u201d of the importance of funding Ukraine. Or perhaps he has calculated that the bill will likely pass even if he opposes it, and he prefers not to highlight the limits of his influence. Or perhaps he wishes to avoid blame should Ukraine suffer substantial reverses on the battlefield.\n\nWhatever the motivation, Trump\u2019s silence this week\u2014which could end in the time it takes to post on social media\u2014is a reminder of the importance of listening for the dog that doesn\u2019t bark. Had Trump sought to kill the aid package, it might still be sitting in the speaker\u2019s inbox. If the bill passes when it comes to a vote tomorrow, it will be none too soon. CIA Director William Burns warned yesterday that if Congress does not pass the aid package, \u201cthere is a very real risk that Ukrainians could lose on the battlefield by the end of 2024.\u201d\n\nCampaign Update\n\nSix members of the extended Kennedy family, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr\u2019s sister, appeared with Biden at a campaign rally in Philadelphia yesterday to endorse his reelection. As they were doing so, the Kennedy campaign announced that the third-party candidate had made the ballot in the battleground state of Michigan. Kennedy has already qualified in Utah and has gathered the signatures needed to qualify in seven other states, including the battleground states of Nevada and North Carolina.\n\nA dozen news organizations issued a statement on Sunday calling on Biden and Trump \"to publicly commit to participating in general election debates.\" In anticipation of the news organizations\u2019 statement, the Trump campaign sent a letter to the Commission on Presidential Debates last week urging it to hold more than the proposed three presidential debates and to hold them earlier in the year because of early voting. The Trump campaign statement added: \u201cWe have already indicated President Trump is willing to debate anytime, anyplace, and anywhere\u2013and the time to start these debates is now.\u201d The Biden campaign did not immediately respond to the media statement or to the Trump letter. Biden said last month that his willingness to debate Trump \u201cdepends on his behavior.\"\n\nI noted last week that Alabama state law would bar Biden from appearing on its ballot in November because he won\u2019t be officially nominated until after the state\u2019s deadline passes for parties to certify their candidates. That problem is on its way to being solved. The Alabama House and Senate both moved forward this week with legislation that would move the certification deadline to after the Democratic convention convenes.\n\nMicrosoft reported that Russian influence operations aimed at interfering with the U.S. election \u201chave picked up steam in the past two months. The Microsoft Threat Analysis Center (MTAC) has tracked at least 70 Russian actors engaged in Ukraine-focused disinformation, using traditional and social media and a mix of covert and overt campaigns.\u201d On the positive side, Microsoft has also found that \u201cthe use of high-production synthetic deepfake videos of world leaders and candidates has so far not caused mass deception and broad-based confusion. In fact, we have seen that audiences are more likely to gravitate towards and share simple digital forgeries, which have been used by influence actors over the past decade. For example, false news stories with real news agency logos embossed on them.\u201d\n\nThe Candidates in Their Own Words\n\nBiden wrote an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday calling on the U.S. House to pass the long-stalled aid bill for Israel and Ukraine. \u201cThere are moments in history that call for leadership and courage,\u201d the president wrote. \u201cThis is one of them.\u201d\n\nThat same day, Biden told a rally in his hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania, that he wants his trade representative to triple tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from China. The announcement was more symbolic than substantive. Chinese steel and aluminum already face heavy U.S. tariffs, which is why they account for only 0.6 per cent of total U.S. steel demand. Two other Biden administration trade moves announced on Wednesday were more significant. One was the decision to work with Mexican authorities to crack down on Chinese efforts to evade tariffs by routing their imports through Mexico. The other was the announcement by the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s office that it was opening an investigation into China\u2019s domination of shipbuilding.\n\nAt a rally on Tuesday in Schnecksville, Pennsylvania, a town sixty-three miles north of Philadelphia, Trump fired up a crowd that chanted, \u201cGenocide Joe,\u201d presumably a critique of Biden\u2019s support for Israel\u2019s military operations in Gaza. Trump responded by saying: \u201cThey are not wrong. They are not wrong. He has done everything wrong.\"\n\nTrump responded to Iran\u2019s attack by saying: \u201cThey\u2019re (Israel) under attack right now. That\u2019s because we show great weakness... The weakness that we\u2019ve shown is unbelievable, and it would not have happened if we were in office.\u201d\n\nTrump responded to Iran\u2019s attack on Israel by posting on Truth Social a screenshot of Florida Senator Rick Scott\u2019s tweet resurrecting a 2018 Trump tweet:\n\nThis is the strength we need back in the White House! https://t.co/rvs7IQf7sk \u2014 Rick Scott (@ScottforFlorida) April 14, 2024\n\nCornel West and Melina Abdullah did a joint interview with CNN. The Israel-Hamas war came up. West said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe in killing an innocent anybody. But you don\u2019t start with those voices without coming to terms with the vicious killings and occupations that\u2019s been going on for 75 years, and then you get a counterterrorist response to that.\u201d\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video West Abdullah CNN Video Pause Video Pause West Abdullah CNN Embed\n\nAbdullah said, \u201cI find it really troubling that we are constantly asked to condemn Hamas. I\u2019m not a member of Hamas.\u201d She added, \u201cI find it even more troubling that an entire state has been built on the genocide of a people, and I think that we have to start with that first.\u201d\n\nWhat the Pundits Are Saying\n\nPolitico\u2019s Nahal Toosi argued that \u201cthere is no Biden strategy for Iran.\u201d In Toosi\u2019s view, the Biden administration \u201cdoesn\u2019t seem willing to even say it wants to fundamentally change the regime\u2019s behavior\u201d and \u201cis managing a problem, not trying to solve it.\u201d Perhaps. But it\u2019s worth recalling that many if not most problems in world affairs are not solved but merely managed.\n\nPolitico\u2019s Gavin Bade reported that Trump is considering an effort to weaken the dollar should he return to the White House. The idea would be to boost U.S. exports by making them less expensive. But as Bade notes, weakening the dollar could have \u201cfar-reaching consequences, from sending consumer prices for imported products soaring, to inviting retaliation from other countries and threatening the dollar\u2019s role as world reserve currency, which would undermine U.S. sanctions on adversaries like Iran and Russia.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times\u2019 Ian Prasad Philbrick examined the \u201cnostalgia bump\u201d that Trump is enjoying in the polls. Like many presidents before him, he is more popular now than he was when he was in office. \u201cThe difference this year,\u201d Philbrick noted, \u201cis that, for the first time in decades, a former president is running to reclaim his old office.\u201d\n\nThe Atlantic\u2019s Ron Brownstein explored how Israel\u2019s war in Gaza is dividing the Democratic Party. In Brownstein\u2019s view, before Iran\u2019s drone and missile attack on Israel, \u201cBiden faced greater division in his own coalition over his handling of the Israel-Hamas war than any other Democratic president has confronted on a foreign-policy choice in decades.\u201d\n\nPolitico\u2019s Veronika Melkozerova argued that Trump\u2019s lack of sympathy toward Ukraine has less to do with geopolitical calculations than personal ones. \u201cIt was, after all, a phone call with [Ukrainian Volodymyr] Zelenskyy that led to Trump\u2019s first impeachment in December 2019, after he was accused of seeking to influence the 2020 election by leaning on the Ukrainian leader to investigate current President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\u201d\n\nWhat the Polls Show\n\nA poll released yesterday by the Institute of Politics (IOP) at Harvard Kennedy School highlights Biden\u2019s struggles in appealing to younger voters. Biden now leads Trump 56 percent to 37 percent among likely voters under the age of thirty. At this time back in 2020, Biden led Trump by 60 percent to 30 percent.\n\nThe Campaign Schedule\n\nThe oral arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court on Trump\u2019s claim that he has blanket immunity for all his actions while president are set to begin in six days (April 25, 2024).\n\nThe Republican National Convention opens in Milwaukee in eighty-seven days (July 15, 2024).\n\nThe Democratic National Convention opens in Chicago in 122 days (August 19, 2024).\n\nElection Day is 200 days away.\n\nInauguration Day is 276 days away.\n\nSinet Adous assisted in the preparation of this post.",

        "text": "US migrant crisis shifts from Texas to California border\nUS migrant crisis shifts from Texas to California border\n\nGetty Images A surge of illegal border crossings has fuelled US political debate\n\nOn a blustery morning last month, volunteer Adriana Jasso raised the flaps to a tent propped up against the massive steel bars of the fence that straddles this stretch of the US-Mexico border. On her side, plastic tables were piled with apples, packets of hot chocolate, mylar blankets and stacks of ponchos - supplies waiting for hungry and tired migrants who had travelled for weeks, or even months, to reach California.\n\nOn the other side, visible through the gaps in the towering barrier, a group of more than 100 people - from countries including Ecuador, Colombia, China and Rwanda - huddled together, waiting to be let through on to US soil. This border point south of San Diego is now one of the busiest along the entire US-Mexico frontier, which stretches around 1,950 miles (3,140km) from here to eastern Texas and the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nA record surge of illegal border crossings in recent years has fuelled the debate over immigration and border security, emerging as a key voter concern ahead of the US presidential election in November. While the border crisis has mostly centred on Texas, where Republican Governor Greg Abbott has waged a fight with President Joe Biden over his immigration policies, recent figures show the geography of the US migration problem is shifting west to border states like Arizona and California.\n\nIn San Ysidro, some 16 miles south of wealthy San Diego, crossings were up 85% in February from the previous year compared with Texas, which saw illegal entries dip during the same period. The BBC's US partner CBS reported that in January, the border crossing in Del Rio, Texas, recorded a few hundred apprehensions a day - compared to 2,300 daily migrant crossings in December.\n\nThe migrant flow shift is due in part to the Texas governor's clampdown on illegal migration and Mexican authorities tightening security across the border as well.\n\nThe sheer number of people arriving has overwhelmed resources in the San Diego area; after migrants are apprehended and processed at a facility near the border, local officials told the BBC that up to 1,000 people a day are being released at city train and bus stops.\n\nJust after 8am, Border Patrol agents arrived and opened the gate to begin intake on the strip of land where migrants have been waiting. Men are allowed only one layer of clothing, women and children two; they line up and pull off jackets and shoelaces (which are not allowed at the processing centre due to safety concerns), packing them into plastic bags or backpacks. From there, they file on to buses and head to a processing centre, where they are registered and can file a claim for asylum. The vast majority are heading to towns and cities across the US where they have family, friends and networks.\n\nThe influx of migrants scattered across the country has strained communities, frustrating local officials and placing immigration at the top of the political agenda. A Wall Street Journal poll released in March ranked immigration among the top two issues for registered voters in seven battleground states - Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. At least 72% of those voters across the seven states said the country's immigration policy and border security were heading in the wrong direction, according to the survey.\n\nGetty Images The sheer number of people arriving has overwhelmed resources along California's southern border\n\nEven in California, the nation's largest Democratic stronghold, 62% of registered voters said US borders were not secure in preventing illegal border crossings compared to 30% who said they were secure, according to a UC Berkeley Institute of Government Studies poll released in January.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has accused Mr Biden of creating a \"bloodbath\" at the US-Mexico border. The president accused Mr Trump of scuppering a bipartisan immigration bill for political gain.\n\nThe border featured heavily during President Trump's time in office - his administration built roughly 15 miles of new barriers and reinforced or increased the height along another 350 miles of existing border wall structure. That includes near San Diego, where the Trump administration completed bollard fencing in 2019 that juts into the Pacific Ocean along a stretch of beach just north of Tijuana, Mexico, to stop migrants from swimming into the country. According to a study published in the JAMA medical journal, this has led to a significant increase in migrant drowning deaths.\n\nNora Vargas, chairwoman of the Board of Supervisors in San Diego County, has witnessed ups and downs of migration over several years. Since the Biden administration in May 2023 lifted Title 42, a pandemic-era policy that allowed US officials to expel migrants who came to the border, Vargas says around 80,000 migrants have arrived through San Diego County.\n\nThe Biden administration's attempt to stop migrants from crossing illegally and encourage them to apply for asylum via an app has been plagued by technical issues, and it has not appeared to slow the number of people crossing, due to the push factors like violence and poverty, says Vargas.\n\n\"We should be able to find ways to ensure that people are treated with dignity, with respect, especially if you're fleeing persecution,\" she said.\n\nVargas tells the BBC her county had an effective solution for mitigating the crisis: migrant transitional centres, or short-term facilities where newly arrived migrants could access food and medical treatment, charge their phones, and plan their next steps: migrants arriving here are not staying. Instead, they're moving on to other towns and cities across the US, where they have a network of family or friends.\n\nBut as the numbers of asylum seekers arriving everyday ticked up, the county exhausted its funding. Vargas wrote an urgent letter to the White House in February, asking for federal assistance to help cover the estimated $1.5m (\u00a31.2m) a month required to operate the facilities.\n\nFunding didn't arrive, however. The county was forced to close the transitional centre. Vargas blames Congress for failing to pass the Senate's bipartisan package of measures including funding for tackling the immigration crisis at the border.\n\nGetty Images The Trump administration built roughly 15 miles of new border barriers\n\nIn the absence of transitional centres, Border Patrol agents are now dropping off some 900 people a day at bus and train stations in San Diego, a city of around 1.3 million people. At the Iris Avenue Transit Center, a swelling crowd of migrants milled around on a Sunday afternoon earlier this month, exhausted and relieved.\n\nMen and women from Brazil, India, China and Latin America called family members and consulted maps, trying to plot a path to their final destination. A group of young men from Guinea told the BBC they'd fled political instability, flying to Istanbul, then to Colombia, then trekking to the US.\n\n\"Nobody wants to leave their home,\" a young woman from Ecuador said, blaming gangs and mafia groups in her home country that created an atmosphere of fear and violence.\n\nTwo men from Medell\u00edn, Colombia, told the BBC they made the journey to the US to find work.\n\nJim Desmond, a member of the San Diego County Board of Supervisors, visited the Iris Transit Center recently and told the BBC that non-profits are helping many of the migrants get to the airport, where they are hoping to secure a ticket to their final destination. Now, the airport itself is becoming a shelter, he says.\n\n\"To have tourists come, you know off a flight or they're leaving, we don't want it to be their first or last impression, to see people sleeping and spending the night at San Diego airport,\" he said.\n\nDesmond is raising the alarm in his county over what he calls the unimpeded flow of people, many of whom he believes have not been properly vetted. It is not Congress, he says, but the White House that should be finding pathways to bolster legal immigration and swiftly clamp down on those who cross illegally.\n\nThe White House has signalled that President Biden is eyeing executive action on securing the border, in lieu of a bill from Congress. California Governor Gavin Newsom, who has referred to the asylum system as \"broken\" and called for federal support for states and cities, has sought to put the blame squarely on Republican lawmakers and Mr Trump for rejecting border legislation.\n\n\"It used to be in the Obama administration, in the Trump administration, and Bush and even Clinton, that migrants coming across the border illegally would run from border patrol agents. Now they're running to them,\" Desmond said. \"And they're being processed and being dropped off and jumping ahead of the line. And anytime you have some entity that allows people to jump ahead of the line, chaos ensues.\"\n\nBack in San Ysidro, a young woman named Olga, wearing a transparent poncho over a pink winter coat, gripped a cup of coffee as she explained that she'd departed Ecuador four weeks earlier, to escape a different kind of chaos - soaring gang violence and economic hardship.\n\nShe left three children with family in Ecuador and is hoping to reunite with her fourth child, who is in the US. The journey had shaken her. \"There were good people but also bad people,\" she said through tears.",

This year, the match-up is the same, but the feelings are much more complicated.Gen Z and late Millennial voters (ages 18-29) are more dissatisfied with their choices and worried over kitchen table issues such as inflation and housing. But most still support Biden over Trump, contrary to some earlier polls, and they do still intend to make their voices heard in November, according to a new Harvard Youth Poll released Thursday.John Della Volpe, the IOP's longtime polling director, said he sees \"seismic mood swings\" in the results as young people feel \"angst\" over a host of issues.\"They're deeply concerned \u2026 about the direction of the country. They are deeply concerned about their own economic well-being, the cost of housing, inflation, [the] day-to-day cost of living. They're concerned about conflicts around the world,\" he said. \"But at the same time, the choice between Donald Trump and Joe Biden isn't necessarily close.\"The poll surveyed just over 2,000 Americans nationwide between the ages of 18 and 29 from March 14-21. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.02 points. Launched in 2000, the Harvard Youth Poll is the largest political survey of young Americans and is administered by the Harvard Public Opinion Project, an undergraduate-run organization.In a head-to-head matchup, Biden leads Trump by eight points (45 percent-37 percent). Among those most likely to vote, his lead expands to 19 points (56 percent-37 percent). That\u2019s considerably smaller than Biden's advantage in spring 2020 when he was up by 23 points among all young voters and 30 points among likely voters.When third-party and independent candidates Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Jill Stein, and Cornel West are included, Biden's lead over Trump shrinks from 19 to 13 points among likely voters.Trump enjoys significant enthusiasm (76 percent) from those who already favor him but can\u2019t seem to garner more than 37 percent of support from young voters.The outcome of his current criminal trial in New York City, however, could damage that support.Trump has been charged with falsifying business records to conceal an extramarital affair in 2016 in a case prosecuted by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg '95, J.D. '99. The survey showed that if Trump is found guilty, Biden would get a nine-point bump among likely voters and a 10-point bump among all young people.Asked whether the country is on the right or wrong track, more than half (58 percent) said the wrong track, and nearly one-third were unsure. Only 9 percent said the country is moving in the right direction, the first time this number was in the single digits in the poll's 24-year history, organizers said. Four years ago, 21 percent said the nation was headed in the right direction.Some Democrats have voiced concerns that significant numbers of young voters, dissatisfied with their election choices, might sit out the 2024 election. According to the poll, 53 percent say they'll \"definitely\" vote this fall, compared to 54 percent who said the same and did so in numbers that helped propel Biden to victory in 2020.Poll results showed that two issues closely associated with under-30 voters \u2014 the Israel-Hamas war and student debt relief \u2014 may not be especially consequential ones when it comes to casting votes.Biden gets good marks (39 percent) for his efforts to reduce student debt, and poor marks for his handling of the war in Gaza (18 percent). But young people ranked these as least important among the issues facing the country. The majority said inflation, healthcare, and housing were the top three matters, followed by gun violence, according to the poll.Confidence in the nation's institutions has plummeted among younger Americans over the last two election cycles. Since 2015, trust in the presidency has dropped 60 points and in the Supreme Court by 55.

        "text": "Ready, Set, Vote! Preparing Snapchatters for the 2024 US Elections\nAhead of the 2024 U.S. elections, today we're sharing how we'll empower Snapchatters to engage in the election process and ensure that Snapchat remains a space for accurate and helpful information.\n\nCivic Engagement\n\nAt Snapchat, we believe that exercising one\u2019s right to vote is one of the most powerful forms of self-expression. As a platform with significant reach with U.S. voters \u2014 of the 100M+ Snapchatters we reach in the U.S., over 80% are aged 18 or older 1 \u2014 we want to make it as easy as possible for our community to learn about the issues and register to vote.\n\nIn 2016 we first started providing Snapchatters with in-app resources to learn about local issues and civic engagement. In 2018, we helped over 450,000 Snapchatters register to vote, in 2020, we helped 1.2 million Snapchatters register to vote and 30 million access voting information, and ahead of the last U.S. midterm election, we helped 4 million people learn about opportunities to run for office themselves.\n\nIn 2024, we are continuing our commitment to help our community stay civically engaged: In partnership with Vote.org, we\u2019re launching in-app tools to make voter engagement even more seamless. This will allow Snapchatters to check their registration status, register to vote, sign up for election reminders, and make a plan for Election Day \u2013 all without leaving the app.\n\nElection Content on Snapchat\n\nTo provide Snapchatters with more access to accurate information, we are once again covering the election on Snapchat. Our flagship news show Good Luck America has provided political news to Snapchatters since 2016, and this year, it will continue to offer perspectives and explanations around key election events through November.\n\nGood Luck America will cover the biggest moments from the campaign trail \u2014 including rallies from the leading presidential candidates, coverage of the upcoming national conventions, and Election Day itself. The show will also launch a new series: the Good Luck America Campus Tour, which will travel to colleges and universities in battleground states, including HBCUs and community colleges, to hear how young people are feeling about the election and the issues they care most about.\n\nWe also have a range of trusted media partners that will provide election coverage on Snapchat. As the anchor of our partnered news coverage, NBC News\u2019 Stay Tuned will present 24 on \u201924, a series featuring 24 key voices that will help shape the 2024 election, speaking with Gen Z voters in local, state, and federal elections about the core issues that resonate with them. Throughout the 2024 election cycle, Stay Tuned will also feature on-the-ground coverage of key events including conventions, rallies, speeches, and more.\n\nContent Moderation and Political Ads\n\nThis year we will remain vigilant in providing Snapchatters credible news and information. We continue to partner with vetted media outlets and restrict the ability for misinformation to spread by moderating public content before it can be seen by lots of people.\n\nWe also vet political ads through a rigorous human review process, which involves checking for any misleading use of content, including the use of AI to create deceptive images. In addition, we partner with the nonpartisan Poynter Institute to independently fact-check political ad statements. Furthermore, we employ a registration and certification process to vet potential purchasers of political ads. You can learn more about our ongoing work to safeguard the integrity of civic content on Snapchat here .\n\nWe\u2019re committed to playing our part to encourage civic engagement and are excited to work alongside our partners to provide our community with the tools and information they need to make their voices heard this fall.\n\n\u2013 Team Snapchat",

Like gerrymandering, voter intimidation can be traced directly back to the end of Reconstruction, which ushered in the Jim Crow era. The Compromise of 1877 was an off-the-record deal between southern Democrats and representatives for the Republican presidential candidate (Rutherford Hayes) to settle the disputed 1876 presidential election. The southerners threw their support behind Hayes and, in return, Hayes withdrew federal troops from South Carolina and Louisiana\u2014effectively ending Reconstruction in those states and the rest of the South. The end of Reconstruction immediately resulted in southern legislatures passing a series of laws requiring the separation of whites from \u201cpersons of color,\u201d soon known as the \u201c Jim Crow laws .\u201d\n\nThe sole purpose of Jim Crow laws was to ensure that the 15th Amendment\u2014which guaranteed formerly enslaved people the right to vote\u2014would for all intents and purposes become unenforceable. These repressive laws, coupled with widespread racial gerrymandering and voter intimidation to suppress the Black vote, assured the continuation of white supremacist rule. Jim Crow laws lasted for nearly another 100 years.\n\nThough the Voting Rights Act of 1965 specifically outlawed voter intimidation, its passage has not prevented the far-right conservative factions from reviving this practice as a tried-and-true method for gaining and maintaining electoral power. It is clear that\u2014 given the high stakes that the 2024 presidential election presents\u2014these factions will not hesitate in utilizing voting intimidation tactics.\n\nVoter Intimidation Defined\n\nHaving discussed the historical context of voter intimidation as a tool for depriving communities of color the power to determine who will represent their interests, it is useful to briefly define what voter intimidation is as an applied voter suppression technique.\n\nA good working definition of voter intimidation is that it is \u201cany action that intimidates voters and scares them away from, or has the potential to scare them away from, exercising their constitutional right to vote.\u201d However, it would be a mistake to limit the definition of voter intimidation to a standardized definition. In practice, voter intimidation is far more complex and can range from actual or implied violence to subtle coercions that make targeted people hesitant about voting.\n\nFor instance, voter intimidation may be in the form of someone or a group of people purposely and visibly positioning themselves inside or outside polling places. The overt intent of the act is to send a threat or convey extreme discomfort to discourage certain people from casting their vote. We should be reminded that voter intimidation is a form of voter suppression. This is because voter intimidation involves actions or and strategies that are intended to coerce people to vote against their own value or interests\u2014and ultimately discourage them from voting altogether.\n\nOther examples of voter intimidation involve strangers, with no official voting monitoring credentials, visibly stationing themselves at voting drop boxes, and videotaping prospective voters as they approach a voting place, in a threatening way. Perhaps the most deeply unsettling intimidation tactic is when individuals\u2014again with no official voting monitoring credentials\u2014take pictures of voters\u2019 license plates as they near a voting place.\n\nRobocalls\n\nDeceptive political robocalls (or sending flyers or mailers) that spread false information or cause confusion among voters can be considered a form of voter intimidation. For instance, during Texas\u2019s Super Tuesday primary in March 2020, robocalls falsely informed voters that they could vote \u201ctomorrow.\u201d Similarly, in 2004, flyers distributed in Franklin County, Ohio, falsely instructed Republicans to vote on Tuesday and Democrats on Wednesday due to elevated levels of voter registration. Such methods can mislead voters and potentially discourage them from participating in elections.\n\nA more recent occurrence in New Hampshire helps to underscore the power of AI-driven robocalling. AI-generated robocalls were used to imitate the voice of President Biden. The \u201cBiden\u201d robocall so closely resembled the president\u2019s voice that it easily fooled those who received the call. The message in the call falsely suggested that if the recipient of the call voted in the New Hampshire primary, they would not be able to vote in the November election.\n\nThe danger of such robocalls, as a threat to fair elections, was recognized by Congress and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Both were alarmed that the dishonest robocalls were so easily introduced into an otherwise legitimate election process. In response to their alarm, on February 2024 the FCC outlawed robocalls that contain voices generated by artificial intelligence.\n\nWhile the FCC\u2019s actions should be applauded, there should be healthy skepticism that the FCC rule will end dishonest AI-generated robocalls\u2014especially those that are produced by foreign actors who want to interfere in American elections.\n\nIntimidation of Voting Poll Workers and Election Officials\n\nRecently, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) briefed election officials and workers about the availability of federal grants through the 2002 Help America Vote Act and the American Rescue Plan to increase physical security at election locations. The precautions stem from the unprecedented intimidation of election officials and workers during the 2020 presidential election\u2014driven by the erroneous belief of Trump supporters that the election was being stolen.\n\nThe election denier factions among conservative groups are apparently playing a significant role in implementing a plan to intimidate the country\u2019s voters. For instance, an election denier organization called the Conservative Partnership Institute seeks to coordinate a nationwide effort to staff election offices, recruit poll watchers and poll workers, and build teams of local citizens to challenge voter rolls, question postal workers, be \u201cever-present\u201d in local election offices, and inundate election officials with document requests.\n\nIncidents of harassment and physical attacks on local election workers themselves have had a role in causing deep fears and apprehension among election worker staff. For example , in Pennsylvania, approximately 50 senior-level county election officials have resigned since the 2020 election. Similarly, in Nevada, 10 (out of 17) top election officials resigned, retired, or declined to seek re-election since the 2020 vote. Nationally, one in five election workers told the Brennan Center for Justice that they planned to quit before the 2024 presidential election, citing stress and political attacks as driving factors. The need to protect poll workers and election officials needs to be an ongoing effort. As referenced previously, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 provides for penalties to protect against voter intimidation.\n\nIt is now necessary for states to enhance enforceable laws specific to protecting voters and election workers. The Brennan Center for Justice has developed a resource that highlights the laws and policies in the states of Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wisconsin as they relate to intimidation of poll workers and officials. This resource is helpful for voting rights coalitions and organizations with a voting rights advocacy program (such as the National Association of Social Workers [NASW]) in tracking how states respond to this threat.\n\nIntersection of Gun Violence and Voter Intimidation\n\nIn a time when gun ownership and the culture of guns is at its highest, the intersection of implied or real threats of gun violence and voter intimidation should not be minimized.\n\nThe Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence raised this concern. Giffords Law Center\u2019s position is that \u201cgun violence [is] at epidemic levels in the United States, [and] the presence of armed individuals angered by false claims about voter fraud creates real health and safet y risks. The presence of guns makes it more likely that heated confrontations will turn deadly. With 46 states allowing private citizens to challenge a voter\u2019s eligibility, guns at the polls are a tinder box near an open flame.\u201d\n\nIn fact, gun rights extremists have already used the tactic of open carry firearms displays as intimidation at protests, including voting rights related events. Voting officials, planning for voting protection procedures, must develop strategies for preventing and intercepting individuals openly carrying firearms within the perimeters of polling places that prohibit firearms. Please note the following: There is no federal law specifically prohibiting the presence of firearms at polling sites. Instead, regulation is left to the states:\n\nTargeting Communities of Color\n\nAs has been mentioned, voter intimidation has existed throughout American history, and it has almost always been directed at people of color. In fact, there are similarities between the voter intimidation practices found in the south at the end of Reconstruction and those seen today. Once such similarity is how some have openly embraced racial oppression and intimidation to achieve absolute power.\n\nThough Black people have been most widely subjected to voter intimidation, other communities of color (namely Native American and Latino communities) have been discouraged from voting due to incidents of\u2014in a historical context\u2014violent acts of voter intimidation. As stated by an impacted member of the Native American community,\n\n\u201cOne thing few Americans understand is that American Indians and Native Alaskans were the last group in the United States to get citizenship and to get the vote. Even after the civil war and the Reconstruction (13th, 14th, and 15th) amendments there was a supreme court decision that said indigenous people could never become US citizens, and some laws used to disenfranchise them were still in place in 1975. In fact, first-generation violations used to deny\u2014not just dilute voting rights\u2014were in place for much longer for Native Americans than any other group. It\u2019s impossible to understand contemporary voter suppression in Indian Country without understanding this historical context.\u201d\n\nOver the years, American Indians faced barriers to voting such as poll taxes, literacy tests, and intimidation. Many Native Americans who live on tribal lands do not have a formal address, which is often required for state-issued identification.\n\nImpact of Voter Intimidation on Election Outcomes\n\nVoter intimidation is designed to be highly impactful. There is ample evidence that the 2020 and 2022 elections were affected by and made vulnerable to misinformation and disinformation on social media, through intimidation of election officials and election interference. Experts have sounded the alarm that these threats will more likely reemerge during the 2024 national elections. If government officials and the voting rights community do not immediately counteract these tactics, we will be robbed of our ability to participate in the democratic process. Failure to do so, will mean that voting participation and election outcomes will be severely compromised in 2024 .\n\nThe impact of voter intimidation patterns and practices has to be viewed in conjunction with existing illegal and unethical tactics such as racial gerrymandering and the range of voter suppression schemes. That said, their collective negative impact has been and continues to be immeasurable, not only to the nation as a whole, but to vulnerable and marginalized Americans in particular.\n\nBroadly speaking, voter intimidation can have significant consequences on election outcomes, especially when voter protections are lacking. Key areas of impact include:\n\nReduced Voter Turnout: Intimidation tactics, such as threatening or harassing voters, can deter people from going to the polls.\n\nIntimidation tactics, such as threatening or harassing voters, can deter people from going to the Disenfranchisement: Intimidation can disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, including minorities, low-income individuals, and marginalized communities. When these groups face intimidation, they may be less likely to cast their votes, resulting in their voices being silenced and their rights denied.\n\nIntimidation can disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, including minorities, low-income individuals, and marginalized communities. When these groups face intimidation, they may be less likely to cast their votes, resulting in their voices being silenced and their rights denied. Skewed Election Results: If intimidation tactics are successful in suppressing the vote in specific areas or among specific demographics, it can distort the overall election results. Candidates or parties that benefit from voter suppression may gain an unfair advantage.\n\nIf intimidation tactics are successful in suppressing the vote in specific areas or among specific demographics, it can distort the overall election results. Candidates or parties Undermining Democracy: Voter intimidation undermines the principles of democracy. When citizens are afraid to exercise their right to vote freely and without fear, it diminishes trust in the electoral process and weakens democratic institutions.\n\nVoter Intimidation as a Threat to Democracy It is useful to further discuss how voter intimidation plays a role in weakening democracy. We have to remember that our democracy is under threat when citizens cannot vote and express their will without fear of harassment, violence, or prosecution. It is no secret that the goal of purveyors of voter intimidation is to make otherwise eligible voters become so afraid, they will not vote\u2014 even when their vote could benefit them, their families, and their community. It is understood that, when successful, voter intimidation will erode democracy and allow for long-term domination of election outcomes by a powerful minority\u2014in other words, end democracy in the United States.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, there appears to be far less opposition to autocratic rule among Americans to an autocratic government than in the past. This is deeply concerning. As an article in Time magazine points out:\n\n\u201cAmericans aren\u2019t hiding their retreat toward autocracy. In October, the Public Religion Research Institute published damning polling that indicated roughly four-in-10 Americans thought the country was so far afield from normal that it was time for a leader who would break the rules to fix the system. Among Republicans, the number almost reached half. The same think tank also found a surge in support for resorting to political violence; in March 2021, pollsters found 15% of Americans agreed that violence was merited, a number that rose to 23% this year. Among Republicans, that number reaches 33%.\u201d\n\nThis gradual\u2014but measurable\u2014shift in Americans\u2019 perception of autocracy has the potential to create an atmosphere that finds voter intimidation to be an acceptable practice in order to hold on to power.\n\nStrategies and Laws to End Voter Intimidation\n\nGiven the threat to democracy, states (and the federal government) should fight against voter intimidation\u2014as well as racial gerrymandering\u2014through key policies. These policies should include limits on the activities of partisan poll watchers and banning guns in polling places.\n\nBecause voter intimidation is so deeply rooted in American history, combating it has been challenging at all levels of government. The most effective way to combat voting intimidation is with voter protection laws and policies at the federal and state level. In fact, 11 federal civil and criminal statutes are available for taking actions against incidents of possible voter intimidation. Federal and state governments are well aware of the legal and statutory resources available to protect voting rights. The Biden Administration has made firm commitments to prevent and end voting intimidation and related efforts to deny equal access to voting. Numerous federal and state laws and policies guard against voter intimidation, election worker intimidation, and disruption of the voting process. These laws are flexible enough to account for the new sources and targets of threats that have emerged in recent years.\n\nJohn Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and Freedom to Vote Act\n\nUntil recently, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was a strong instrument for monitoring and, if necessary, sanctioning\u2014using Section 5 , the act\u2019s strongest enforcement tool. However, in 2013, the Supreme Court struck down Section 5 , ruling that it was no longer necessary. That decision seriously diluted DOJ\u2019s ability to compel compliance with anti-voter intimidation provisions in the Voting Rights Act\u2014as well as other essential provisions.\n\nIt is this major gap in the ability to protect voting rights that prompted a Democratic Congress to introduce the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act (VRAA). In essence, VRAA is intended to restore the key provisions of that were stripped out of the Voting Rights Act after the Supreme Court\u2019s 2013 decision. In addition to VRAA, the House Democrats introduced the Freedom to Vote Act, designed to set national standards to expand and enhance protection for access to the ballot.\n\nThe legislation additionally seeks to prevent partisan interference in election administration, prohibits partisan gerrymandering for congressional districts, and addresses problematic issues with campaign finance.\n\nThis bill was reintroduced in 2023 as S.1 and H.R. 11.\n\nStates Emerging as a Critical Voter Protection Firewall\n\nThe states are essential to developing a comprehensive approach to monitoring, preventing, and applying sanctions for acts of voter intimidation. It should be remembered that\u2014according to the Constitution\u2014the states have the authority to regulate federal elections. Therefore, there is logic to states creating laws and policies that are designed to protect voting rights. An increasing number of states are doing just that by passing their own State Voting Rights Acts (VRAs), to prevent and guard against discriminatory voting practices and policies. Given that the federal Voting Rights Act has been weakened, states can fill the voting protection gap left by the Supreme Court\u2019s 2013 ruling. Thus far, California (2002), Washington (2018), Oregon (2019), Virginia (2021), New York (2022), and Connecticut (2023)\u2014have enacted VRAs. Other states such as Maryland and New Jersey are in the process of enacting their VRAs.\n\nVoter Rights Coalitions\n\nVoting rights coalitions\u2014which grew out of the Civil Rights Movement\u2014represent the effectiveness of nongovernmental collaborations in shaping public policy. Relatedly, voting rights coalitions currently (and in the past) are critical resources for raising awareness about the resurgence of widespread voter intimidation. Examples of individual voting rights organizations that are also partners in national voting rights coalitions are the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, NAACP, the American Civil Liberties Union, National Action Network, and the Legal Defense Fund. Each of these organizations\u2014and many others including NASW\u2014are members of the Leadership Conference for Civil and Human Rights\u2019 Voting Rights Taskforce. The Leadership Conference\u2019s voting rights coalition has a history\u2014that began in the 1960s\u2014of success in fighting voter intimidation.\n\nNational Nongovernmental Organizations with State Affiliates\n\nAs the number of states with VRAs increase, there is a potential for a corresponding increase in the importance of the role of national organizations with state affiliates (chapters) in supporting state governments\u2019 efforts to curtail voter intimidation and other illegal voting suppression conduct. There are many such national nongovernmental organizations\u2014including NASW\u2014that are members of major voting rights coalition.\n\nThese organizations are important advocacy and mobilization resources both to the states and to the national coalition effort.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt is eye opening when we reflect upon the fact that\u2014one way or another\u2014voter intimidation has been a part of the American political culture for over 160 years. For those many years, the practice has been a mainstay for denying proportionate political power within communities of color. After the passage of the Voting Rights Act (VRA) of 1965, there was a hope that voter intimidation would disappear. However, hopes were dashed when in 2013 the Supreme Court \u201cgutted\u201d the VRA, and in subsequent years voter intimidation tactics regained a degree of prominence.\n\nA saving grace is that civil and voting right advocates\u2014along with their allies in Congress\u2014immediately recognized the reemergence of this threat and joined together to counteract the threat. While vigilance and coalition building has had some success in raising public concern, that effort may not be sufficient in protecting the votes of many Americans. This is because the opposition\u2014which is unhesitant about expanding voter intimidation\u2014is well-funded, well-organized, and fully committed to winning the 2024 presidential election.\n\nFor that reason, the voting rights community, including NASW, must remain vigilant, organized, mobilized and active in fighting for voter protection. Given that the 2024 election is important on a historical level, we must respond accordingly to forces that attempt to impede free access to the ballot.\n\nResources\n\nIn its effort to protect Americans from voter intimidation, the Advancement Project\u2014a national voting rights organization\u2014created and disseminated the following resource:\n\nIt\u2019s ILLEGAL! First things first, it\u2019s important to know that voter intimidation is a federal crime.\n\nDo not be intimidated if your vote is challenged\n\nAlert the municipal Clerk or Election Officials at polling locations\n\nCall Election Protection at 866-OUR-VOTE\n\nDocument the conduct\n\nDon\u2019t confront the intimidator\n\nIf you believe your voting rights\u2014or the rights of a specific group of people\u2014were violated, speak to a civil rights lawyer in your area.\n\nOther Voter Protection Resources\n\nBrennan Center for Justice",

ISW will cover subsequent reports in the April 22 Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment.\n\nUS Senate Intelligence Committee Chairperson Senator Mark Warner reported on April 21 that US provisions of military aid to Ukraine, including long-range ATACMS missiles, will be in transit to Ukraine \u201cby the end of the week\u201d if the Senate passes the supplemental appropriations bill on April 23 and US President Joe Biden signs it by April 24.[1] Warner stated in an interview with CBS News on April 21 that the US presidential administration has been prepared to provide long-range ATACMS to Ukraine, as specified in the bill, for the past several months.[2] Warner emphasized the extensive battlefield impact that Ukrainian forces have achieved using US-provided military assistance, stating that Ukrainian forces have been able to destroy \u201c87 percent of Russian pre-existing ground forces\u201d (potentially in reference to Russia\u2019s pre-full-scale invasion professional force), 67 percent of Russian tanks, and 32 percent of Russian armored personnel carriers (APCs) for the past two years with less than 3 percent of the US defense budget and military aid from the US and Europe. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin stated on April 20 that the National Security Supplemental that provides support to Ukraine, Israel, and the Indo-Pacific allows about $50 billion to flow into the US defense industrial base (DIB) and will create jobs in over 30 US states.[3] Pentagon Spokesperson Brigadier General Patrick Ryder stated on April 20 that the US Department of Defense (DoD) is considering sending \u201cseveral additional advisors to augment the Office of Defense Cooperation (OCD)\u201d to the US Embassy in Kyiv.[4] Politico reported on April 20 citing an unidentified individual familiar with the matter that the US advisors in Kyiv will help Ukrainian officials plan to sustain US equipment provided to Ukraine and help US embassy officials in Kyiv coordinate new weapons shipments after the supplemental appropriations bill becomes law, likely as part of an effort to alleviate DoD personnel limitations in documenting certain aid.[5]\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated on April 21 that the swift delivery of US military aid to Ukraine could allow Ukrainian forces to stabilize the frontline and seize the initiative.[6] Zelensky stated during an interview with NBC News that US military support gives Ukraine a chance at victory but warned that Ukrainian battlefield progress will depend on how fast military aid arrives on the frontlines. Zelensky noted that delays in the delivery of military assistance have already contributed to Ukrainian materiel and personnel losses in \u201cseveral directions.\u201d Zelensky stated that the Ukrainian military is especially anticipating the deliveries of air defense and long-range weapon systems since Ukrainian forces currently lack significant long-range capabilities to prevent Ukrainian casualties on the frontlines. ISW continues to assess that Ukrainian forces may suffer additional setbacks in the coming weeks while waiting for US security assistance that will allow Ukraine to stabilize the front, but they will likely be able to blunt the current Russian offensive assuming the resumed US assistance arrives promptly.[7] Russian forces will likely intensify ongoing offensive operations and missile and drone strikes in the coming weeks in order to exploit the closing window of Ukrainian materiel constraints.[8]\n\nUkrainian forces struck and damaged the Russian Black Sea Fleet\u2019s (BSF) Kommuna submarine support ship \u2013 the world\u2019s oldest active-duty naval vessel \u2013 in occupied Sevastopol, Crimea on April 21.[9] Geolocated footage published on April 21 shows fire and a smoke plume in Sevastopol Bay, and Russian sources claimed that Russian air defenses intercepted a Ukrainian anti-ship missile in the area.[10] Ukrainian Navy Spokesperson Captain Third Rank Dmytro Pletenchuk confirmed that a Ukrainian strike damaged the Kommuna and that while Ukrainian forces are still clarifying the degree of damage, the Kommuna is clearly incapable of operating.[11] Pletenchuk noted that the Kommuna is over 111 years old and that Russian forces modernized it in 2016 to perform deep sea work, including raising submarines and sunken cargo. Pletenchuk stated that the Kommuna is the only rescue vessel of its class in the BSF. Pletenchuk reported that the Kommuna previously performed rescue operations in the area of the sunken Russian missile cruiser Moskva and large landing ship Tsezar Kunikov and that Russian forces would be unable to perform similar rescue and retrieval operations without the Kommuna. Open-source intelligence analyst HI Sutton noted that the Kommuna provides the Russian Navy with \u201dvaluable capabilities\u201d and that the ship has frequently participated in sea trials and can conduct seabed warfare.[12] Another maritime intelligence analyst suggested that the strike may limit the BSF\u2019s submarine operations and disrupt Russian submarine Kalibr missile launching operations.[13]\n\nUS-sanctioned, pro-Kremlin Moldovan politician Ilan Shor created the new pro-Russian Moldovan Victory electoral bloc on April 21, which plans to run a candidate in the October 20 Moldovan presidential election. Shor led a meeting of Moldovan opposition politicians in Moscow on April 21 and announced that the Shor Party, Revival Party, Chance Party, Alternative Forces of the Salvation of Moldova Party, and the Victoria Party will form the Victory electoral bloc.[14] Shor stated that he will act as the chairperson of the bloc\u2019s executive committee.[15] Yevgenia Gutsul, the governor of Gagauzia, a pro-Russian autonomous region of Moldova, will act as the bloc\u2019s executive secretary.[16] Marina Tauber, a US-sanctioned Moldovan member of parliament and close Shor affiliate, will act as the secretary of the executive committee.[17] Shor stated that the bloc aims to improve Moldova\u2018s relations with Russia and the Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) and Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and advocate against Moldova\u2019s accession into the European Union (EU).[18] The bloc reportedly intends to run a candidate in the October 2024 Moldovan presidential elections and will announce their candidate soon.[19] Shor, Gutsul, and Tauber notably do not meet the minimum age requirement to run for president in Moldova.[20]\n\nThe Victory electoral bloc will likely allow the Kremlin to focus on a unified political effort in Moldova instead of maintaining relations with multiple pro-Russian Moldovan actors and parties, as it has done recently.[21] The electoral bloc is likely intended to create the impression of widespread support in Moldova for pro-Russian policies and Shor himself, who continues to be the major conduit of Kremlin influence in Moldovan politics even though he lives in exile in Israel. Most of the parties that make up the new Victory electoral bloc are already extensively affiliated with Shor and do not possess widespread influence in the Moldovan political sphere. The Chance Party, previously known as the Ours Party, joined Shor\u2019s \u201cChance. Duties. Realization.\u201d (S.O.R.) electoral bloc in June 2023 after Moldovan authorities banned the Shor Party.[22] Moldovan authorities barred the Chance Party from participating in local elections in November 2023, however.[23] The Alternative Forces of the Salvation of Moldova Party registered as a political party in March 2022 and later joined the S.O.R. electoral bloc in June 2023 but does not currently hold any seats in parliament.[24] The Victoria Party is a new party having only registered in late December 2023, and its head, Vadim Groza, was formerly a member of the Socialist Party and is the current mayor of Soldanesti (a city in northeastern Moldova).[25] The Revival Party is likely the most influential of the parties that make up the new Victory electoral bloc, but it currently only holds four seats in Moldova\u2019s 101-seat parliament.[26] The Revival Party was largely defunct until two Moldovan politicians left the Socialist Party to join the Revival Party in May 2023 after meeting with Russian Liberal Democratic Party (LDPR) Head Leonid Slutsky in Russia in March 2023 and with Shor in Israel in May 2023.[27] The Revival Party orchestrated a large-scale protest in Chisinau in February 2024 that called for Moldovan President Maia Sandu to step down.[28] The Moldovan Constitutional Court recently reversed a ruling that banned politicians who were previously members of the Shor Party from running in Moldovan elections, and ISW assessed at the time that the Kremlin would likely more directly exploit and promote Shor Party affiliates before the upcoming Moldovan presidential election.[29] The Kremlin is likely engaged in hybrid operations aimed at destabilizing Moldovan society, attacking Moldova\u2019s democratic government, and preventing Moldova\u2019s accession to the EU, as ISW has extensively reported.[30]\n\nThe Russian and Chinese navies signed a memorandum of understanding and cooperation on April 21 amid recent reports of China\u2019s increased support for Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. Russian Navy Commander-in-Chief Admiral Alexander Moiseev signed a memorandum of understanding and cooperation with Chinese Navy Commander-in-Chief Admiral Hu Zhongming regarding naval search and rescue operations during Moiseev\u2019s visit to China.[31] Moiseev and Hu also discussed Russian and Chinese naval cooperation, and Moiseev will participate in the Western Pacific Naval Symposium in Qingdao on April 22-23, where he will meet with China\u2018s and other unspecified countries\u2019 senior navy officials.[32] Moiseev\u2019s visit to China notably precedes US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken\u2019s travel to China from April 24 through April 26.[33]\n\nThe Kremlin blocked domestic access to the website of the French non-governmental organization Reporters Without Borders (RSF), depriving Russians of access to independent assessments of Russian freedom of speech and press. Independent Russian non-governmental organization Roskomsvoboda reported on April 21 that the RSF website was blocked in Russia alongside other resources that publish information about Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.[34] Roskomsvoboda noted that the official Russian register of blocked sites did not include the federal agency responsible or the official reason for blocking RSF and assessed that the Russian Prosecutor General\u2019s Office was the likely responsible party.[35] RSF publishes an annual \u201cFreedom Index,\u201d in which it scores and ranks 180 countries based on a quantitative analysis of abuses against media and qualitative analyses of journalists\u2019 answers to a survey that gauges five contextual indicators: political, economic, and sociopolitical contexts, legal framework, and safety. The Freedom Index ranked Russia between 148 and 150 out of 180 between 2015 and 2020 before sharply downgrading to 155 in 2022 and 164 in 2023 due to the 2022 censorship laws criminalizing \u201cfake\u201d or \u201cdiscrediting\u201d information about the Russian military, ongoing disinformation campaigns, and declaring almost all independent media organizations as \u201cforeign agents\u201d or \u201cundesirable organizations\u201d since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.[36] The Kremlin has been slowly increasing its physical and informational control over the Russian information space, including by arresting journalists and other opposition voices, implementing laws depriving certain media organizations and figures of their income, and forcing international telecommunications operators to comply with Russian data laws.[37] Blocking the RSF\u2019s site now deprives Russian citizens of a resource to evaluate the impact of such measures on freedom of speech and press in Russia.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\nUS Senate Intelligence Committee Chairperson Senator Mark Warner reported on April 21 that US provisions of military aid to Ukraine, including long-range ATACMS missiles, will be in transit to Ukraine \u201cby the end of the week\u201d if the Senate passes the supplemental appropriations bill on April 23 and US President Joe Biden signs it by April 24.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated on April 21 that the swift delivery of US military aid to Ukraine could allow Ukrainian forces to stabilize the frontline and seize the initiative.\n\nUkrainian forces struck and damaged the Russian Black Sea Fleet\u2019s (BSF) Kommuna submarine support ship \u2013 the world\u2019s oldest active-duty naval vessel \u2013 in occupied Sevastopol, Crimea on April 21.\n\nUS-sanctioned, pro-Kremlin Moldovan politician Ilan Shor created the new pro-Russian Moldovan Victory electoral bloc on April 21, which plans to run a candidate in the October 20 Moldovan presidential election.\n\nThe Victory electoral bloc will likely allow the Kremlin to focus on a unified political effort in Moldova instead of maintaining relations with multiple pro-Russian Moldovan actors and parties, as it has done recently.\n\nThe Russian and Chinese navies signed a memorandum of understanding and cooperation on April 21 amid recent reports of China\u2019s increased support for Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin blocked domestic access to the website of the French non-governmental organization Reporters Without Borders (RSF), depriving Russians of access to independent assessments of Russian freedom of speech and press.\n\nRussian forces recently advanced near Kreminna and Avdiivka and in the Donetsk-Zaporizhia Oblast border area.\n\nRussian forces have increased their use of small, lightweight, off-road vehicles along the frontline.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe do not report in detail on Russian war crimes because these activities are well-covered in Western media and do not directly affect the military operations we are assessing and forecasting. We will continue to evaluate and report on the effects of these criminal activities on the Ukrainian military and the Ukrainian population and specifically on combat in Ukrainian urban areas. We utterly condemn Russian violations of the laws of armed conflict and the Geneva Conventions and crimes against humanity even though we do not describe them in these reports.\n\nRussian Main Effort \u2013 Eastern Ukraine (comprised of two subordinate main efforts)\n\nRussian Subordinate Main Effort #1 \u2013 Capture the remainder of Luhansk Oblast and push westward into eastern Kharkiv Oblast and encircle northern Donetsk Oblast\n\nRussian Subordinate Main Effort #2 \u2013 Capture the entirety of Donetsk Oblast\n\nRussian Supporting Effort \u2013 Southern Axis\n\nRussian Air, Missile, and Drone Campaign\n\nRussian Mobilization and Force Generation Efforts\n\nRussian Technological Adaptations\n\nActivities in Russian-occupied areas\n\nUkrainian Defense Industrial Base Efforts\n\nRussian Information Operations and Narratives\n\nSignificant Activity in Belarus\n\nRussian Main Effort \u2013 Eastern Ukraine\n\nRussian Subordinate Main Effort #1 \u2013 Luhansk Oblast (Russian objective: Capture the remainder of Luhansk Oblast and push westward into eastern Kharkiv Oblast and northern Donetsk Oblast)\n\nRussian forces recently marginally advanced west of Kreminna amid continued positional fighting on the Kupyansk-Svatove-Kreminna line on April 21. Geolocated footage published on April 19 shows that Russian forces marginally advanced east of Yampolivka (west of Kreminna).[38] Positional fighting continued northwest of Svatove near Stelmakhivka; west of Kreminna near Terny; and south of Kreminna near Bilohorivka.[39] Elements of the Russian 1st Guards Tank Army (Moscow Military District [MMD]) reportedly continue operating in the Kupyansk direction, and elements of the Russian 2nd Artillery Brigade (2nd Luhansk People\u2019s Republic [LNR] Army Corps [AC]) reportedly operate near Bilohorivka.[40]\n\nRussian Subordinate Main Effort #2 \u2013 Donetsk Oblast (Russian objective: Capture the entirety of Donetsk Oblast, the claimed territory of Russia\u2019s proxies in Donbas)\n\nRussian forces continued to attack in the Siversk (northeast of Bakhmut) direction on April 21 but did not make any confirmed advances. Ukrainian military sources reported that Russian forces unsuccessfully attacked east of Siversk near Verkhnokamyanske and southeast of Siversk near Spirne.[41] Elements of the Russian 2nd Artillery Brigade (2nd Luhansk People\u2019s Republic [LNR] Army Corps [AC]) reportedly continue to operate near Spirne, and elements of the Russian 106th Guards Airborne (VDV) Division reportedly continue to operate in the Siversk direction.[42]\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) claimed on April 21 that elements of the Russian Southern Grouping of Forces seized Bohdanivka (northeast of Chasiv Yar), but ISW has not observed visual evidence confirming this claim.[43] A prominent Russian milblogger similarly claimed that Ukrainian forces recently withdrew from their remaining positions in the southwestern part of Bohdanivka but did not provide visual evidence to confirm this claim.[44] A Russian VDV-affiliated source claimed that Ukrainian forces still control dominant tactical heights north and northwest of Bohdanivka, and that the frontline situation is complex in the area.[45] A Ukrainian National Guard officer stated on April 21 that Russian forces managed to secure positions in the Bohdanivka area, where they transferred significant materiel and established well-prepared defensive positions.[46] The Ukrainian National Guard officer did not specify if Russian forces control Bohdanivka and assessed that Russian forces may attempt to use Bohdanivka to surround Chasiv Yar from the north and to seize Ivanivske (southeast of Chasiv Yar) to threaten Chasiv Yar from the south.\n\nRussian forces continued to attack Chasiv Yar and the surrounding area on April 21 but did not advance. Positional battles continued near Chasiv Yar, including near the Novyi and Kanal Microraions; northeast of Chasiv Yar near Bohdanivka; southeast of Chasiv Yar near Ivanivske, Klishchiivka, and Shumy; and south of Chasiv Yar near Pivdenne, Niu York, and Oleksandropil.[47] Ukrainian military officials reported that Russian forces have not entered Chasiv Yar itself, and Ukrainian Khortytsia Group of Forces Spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Nazar Voloshyn stated that Russian forces actively use combat vehicles, aviation, and infantry to attack in the Bakhmut direction.[48] The Ukrainian National Guard officer observed that Ukrainian forces can still defend Chasiv Yar itself, unlike its eastern outskirts that have been \u201clong uninhabited and unfit for defense\u201d as they were \u201dpractically destroyed a year ago\u201c and do not have strong fortifications.[49] The Ukrainian National Guard officer added that Russian forces do not fully control Ivanivske and are attempting to advance through the lowlands north of Ivanivske. The Ukrainian National Guard officer implied that although Ukrainian forces can observe slow Russian advances through the lowlands north of Ivanivske towards Chasiv Yar, Ukrainian forces are unable to exploit Russian vulnerabilities because Ukrainian forces are preoccupied with constant Russian airstrikes and frontal assaults. The Ukrainian National Guard officer assessed that Russian forces are using glide bombs, artillery, and multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) before launching ground assaults on Chasiv Yar to set favorable assault conditions by destroying Ukrainian shelters and defensive positions. The Ukrainian National Guard officer added that the Russian military command is serious about seizing Chasiv Yar because Russian forces have successfully trained new mobilized personnel, transferred the most combat-ready units to the Chasiv Yar direction, and are constantly forming reserves to replace heavy losses sustained in assaults on the settlement. The Ukrainian National Guard officer added that Russian VDV elements are leading the assaults on Chasiv Yar, and Russian milbloggers have consistently indicated that elements of the Russian 98th VDV Division are operating near Chasiv Yar.[50] Elements of the Russian 58th Spetsnaz Battalion (1st Donetsk People\u2019s Republic [DNR] AC) are also reportedly operating in the Chasiv Yar direction.[51]\n\nRussian forces recently marginally advanced in eastern Ocheretyne (northwest of Avdiivka). Geolocated footage published on April 20 and April 21 indicates that Russian forces recently advanced in eastern Ocheretyne, and Russian milbloggers also claimed that Russian forces advanced in southeastern Ocheretyne.[52] Russian milbloggers also claimed that Russian forces seized Berdychi (northwest of Avdiivka), but ISW has not observed visual evidence confirming this claim.[53] Positional battles continued northwest of Avdiivka near Ocheretyne, Berdychi, Novokalynove, and Novobakhmutivka; west of Avdiivka near Umanske, Yasnobrodivka, and Semenivka; and southwest of Avdiivka near Pervomaiske, Netaylove, and Nevelske.[54] A prominent Russian milblogger claimed that Russian forces are conducting an \u201coperational pause\u201d (likely referring to a tactical pause) near the Domakha gully on the Pervomaiske-Nevelske line likely due to \u201cdifficult\u201d Ukrainian minefields and Ukrainian drone operations in the area.[55] Ukrainian military observer Kostyantyn Mashovets assessed that the Russian military command is attempting to sustain the tempo of offensive operations in this direction and is re-deploying elements of the 41st Combined Arms Army [CAA], (Central Military District [CMD]) to the area after removing them from combat to restore combat capability.[56] Mashovets noted that elements of the Russian 35th Guards Motorized Rifle Brigade (41st CAA) redeployed to reinforce elements of the 30th Motorized Rifle Brigade (2nd CAA, CMD) and 132nd Separate Guards Motorized Rifle Brigade (1st DNR AC), which are already fighting in the Novokalynove direction as part of efforts to seize Novobakhmutivka and Ocheretyne. Mashovets added that Russian forces also committed elements of the 74th Guards Motorized Rifle Brigade (41st CAA) near Berdychi. Mashovets noted that the Russian Central Grouping of Forces, which operates in the Pokrovsk and Toretsk directions (northwest and northeast of Avdiivka), has over 86,000 personnel, no more than 280 tanks, no less than 760 armored vehicles, and around 1,100 tube and rocket artillery systems.[57] ISW cannot independently verify these estimates.\n\nSome Russian sources claimed that Russian forces captured Novomykhailivka (southwest of Donetsk City) amid continued positional fighting west and southwest of Donetsk City on April 21. Russian milbloggers widely claimed on April 20 and 21 that elements of the Russian 155th Naval Infantry Brigade (Pacific Fleet) and the BARS-22 \u201cTigr\u201d Volunteer Detachment (Russian Combat Army Reserve) completed the seizure of Novomykhailivka and amplified footage of Russian forces allegedly raising a flag on the western outskirts of the village.[58] A prominent Russian milblogger claimed on April 20 and 21, however, that Russian forces have not yet completely seized Novomykhailivka and still need to advance in the western and southern outskirts of the settlement.[59] The milblogger claimed that Russian forces advanced further west into Novomykhailivka than previously observed and claimed that Russian forces captured the Mashinostroitel community garden immediately north of the settlement. ISW has not observed visual evidence confirming the claimed seizure of Novomykhailivka. Another milblogger claimed that Russian forces advanced westward along a section of the Solodke-Vodyane road (southwest of Donetsk City), but ISW has also not observed visual evidence of Russian advances in this area.[60] Positional fighting continued west of Donetsk City near Krasnohorivka and Heorhiivka and southwest of Donetsk City near Vodyane (northeast of Vuhledar).[61] Elements of the Russian 40th Naval Infantry Brigade (Pacific Fleet), 57th Motorized Rifle Regiment (6th Motorized Rifle Division, 3rd AC, Moscow Military District [MMD]); 1472nd Motorized Rifle Regiment (68th AC, Eastern Military District [EMD]); and 39th Motorized Rifle Brigade (68th AC) are reportedly fighting for Novomykhailivka.[62]\n\nRussian forces recently marginally advanced in the Donetsk-Zaporizhia Oblast border area amid continued positional fighting on April 21. Geolocated footage published on April 20 shows that Russian dismounted infantry seized a building south of Urozhaine (south of Velyka Novosilka).[63] A Russian milblogger claimed that Russian forces captured up to one square kilometer of ground near Urozhaine, but ISW has not observed visual confirmation of a one-kilometer advance.[64] Another milblogger claimed that Russian forces are conducting limited assaults to gauge Ukrainian defenses near Urozhaine.[65] Positional fighting also continued near Staromayorske (south of Velyka Novosilka).[66] Elements of the Russian 36th CAA (EMD) reportedly continue to conduct TOS-1A thermobaric artillery strikes against Ukrainian positions in the south Donetsk direction.[67]\n\nRussian Supporting Effort \u2013 Southern Axis (Russian objective: Maintain frontline positions and secure rear areas against Ukrainian strikes)\n\nPositional engagements continued near Robotyne in western Zaporizhia Oblast on April 21, but there were no confirmed changes to the frontline in this area.[68] Elements of the Russian 56th and 108th airborne (VDV) regiments (7th VDV Division) are reportedly operating in the Zaporizhia direction.[69]\n\nPositional engagements continued near Krynky in east (left) bank Kherson Oblast on April 21.[70] Elements of the Russian \u201dDnepr\u201d Cossack Volunteer Brigade are reportedly operating near the Kinburn Spit in Mykolaiv Oblast.[71]\n\nRussian Air, Missile, and Drone Campaign (Russian Objective: Target Ukrainian military and civilian infrastructure in the rear and on the frontline)\n\nRussian forces continued missile strikes against Ukraine during the day on April 21. Ukrainian officials reported that Russian forces fired an unspecified missile at Zaporizhzhia City and unspecified ballistic missiles at port and logistics infrastructure in Odesa City and Odesa Oblast during the day on April 21.[72] The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces shot down two Kh-59 missiles during the day.[73]\n\nUkrainian Air Force Spokesperson Colonel Ilya Yevlash stated that Russian forces are currently intensifying strikes to take advantage of Ukraine\u2019s air defense shortages before Ukraine receives critical military assistance from the US and other Western partners.[74] Yevlash stated that Russia has accumulated a large stockpile of some unspecified missiles while Russian forces strike Ukraine with other newly produced unspecified missiles. Ukrainian Main Military Intelligence Directorate (GUR) Deputy Chief Major General Vadym Skibitskyi stated on April 2 that Russian forces will likely temporarily pause strikes against Ukrainian energy infrastructure in order to replenish low missile stockpiles.[75] Skibitskyi stated that Russian forces had about 950 high-precision operational-strategic and strategic-level missiles with a range of or exceeding 350 kilometers as of April 2 and that Russia aims to prevent this stockpile from falling below 900 missiles.[76]\n\nRussian Mobilization and Force Generation Efforts (Russian objective: Expand combat power without conducting general mobilization)\n\nRussian forces have increased their use of small and lightweight off-road vehicles along the frontline. Ukrainian military analyst Petro Chernyk stated on April 21 that the Russian military has been using small two- and four-seat buggies to transport Russian military personnel to the frontline to make up for a shortage of military transport vehicles.[77] Chernyk noted that international sanctions are limiting Russia\u2019s ability to manufacture battery parts for military transport vehicles. Ukrainian National Guard Spokesperson Ruslan Muzychuk stated on April 16 that there is plenty of footage showing Russian forces using small vehicles to transport infantry to assaults because the vehicles allow Russian forces to quickly transport infantry to favorable positions, setting conditions for the next echelon of Russian infantry to secure the position.[78] Muzychuk noted that these small vehicles offer little protection for Russian infantry, however, and footage published in recent weeks shows Ukrainian forces extensively targeting small vehicles transporting infantry and supplies with first-person view (FPV) drones.[79] Ukrainian sources also amplified drone footage showing Russian forces using vehicles similar to golf carts to transport infantry to the battlefield.[80]\n\nThe Russian military is reportedly advertising increased salaries in occupied Ukraine in an effort to coerce Ukrainian civilians to sign voluntary military service contracts with the Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD), likely as part of ongoing crypto-mobilization efforts. The Ukrainian Resistance Center reported that the Russian military is offering a salary of at least 500,000 rubles ($5,325) per month to civilians in occupied Ukraine who sign Russian military contracts for volunteer service.[81] Bloomberg recently reported that Russian regional one-time payments for signing a contract have increased by 40 percent to an average of 470,000 rubles ($4,992), and a Russian insider source claimed that some Russian authorities are offering one million rubles ($10,622) for people to sign military contracts.[82] Russian authorities may be concerned about decreasing recruitment rates and are attempting to mitigate low recruitment with increased economic incentives, particularly targeting occupied areas of Ukraine. Russia\u2019s occupation has severely degraded the economies and infrastructure of occupied Ukraine, so mobilization efforts in these areas are targeting especially vulnerable populations.\n\nUkrainian Navy Spokesperson Captain Third Rank Dmytro Pletenchuk stated on April 21 that Russian forces in occupied Crimea have trained dolphins to push potential \u201cunderwater saboteurs\u201d (likely meaning special forces divers) to the surface.[83] ISW has previously observed reports that Russian forces are using trained dolphins to defend naval bases in Crimea against special forces divers.[84]\n\nRussian Technological Adaptations (Russian objective: Introduce technological innovations to optimize systems for use in Ukraine)\n\nRussian defense industrial base (DIB) enterprise Kalashnikov Concern presented the new \u201cKolizyey-RU\" drone at the Ryazan Higher Airborne Command School in Ryazan City on April 19.[85] The Kolizyey-RU drone is a multipurpose hexacopter, which reportedly can conduct reconnaissance operations during the day and at night, deliver cargo, and perform other unspecified tasks.\n\nUkrainian Defense Industrial Efforts (Ukrainian objective: Develop its defense industrial base to become more self-sufficient in cooperation with US, European, and international partners)\n\nISW is not publishing coverage of Ukrainian defense industrial efforts today.\n\nActivities in Russian-occupied areas (Russian objective: Consolidate administrative control of annexed areas; forcibly integrate Ukrainian citizens into Russian sociocultural, economic, military, and governance systems)\n\nISW is not publishing coverage of activities in Russian-occupied areas today.\n\nRussian Information Operations and Narratives\n\nKremlin officials and Russian milbloggers responded to the US House of Representatives passing the supplementary appropriations bill on the provision of assistance to Ukraine on April 20 by promoting narratives intended to deter American policymakers from finalizing the aid and to degrade Western and Ukrainian expectations about the impact of the aid on the battlefield. Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov and Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) Spokesperson Maria Zakharova claimed that the US aid will be harmful for Ukrainians and baselessly alleged that the US is a \u201cdirect sponsor\u201d of terrorism.[86] Peskov also attempted to discourage the US from seizing frozen Russian assets with claims that this will damage America\u2018s reputation, and a prominent Russian milblogger expressed concerns that the US seizure of frozen Russian assets will encourage the European Union (EU) to undertake similar measures.[87] Russian Security Council Deputy Chairperson Dmitry Medvedev promoted the longstanding Kremlin narrative that Ukrainians and Russians are \u201cone people\u201d to claim that US aid will continue the \u201ccivil war\u201d between Russians and Ukrainians in Ukraine.[88] The Kremlin consistently uses this narrative to falsely portray its invasion of Ukraine as a regional conflict and to deliberately misrepresent all Western aid provisions as efforts to prolong the war.[89] Medvedev also explicitly emphasized that he wishes that a civil war would break out in the US to \u201ccollapse\u201d the US government. Several Russian milbloggers also aimed to paint the aid as futile, while some noted that Western military aid to Ukraine is bound to significantly impact the frontline situation.[90] ISW assessed on April 20 that Russian officials will likely intensify information operations aimed at weakening US and Western support for Ukraine and promoting Western self-deterrence in the wake of the US House of Representatives passing the aid bill for Ukraine.[91]\n\nZakharova denied that Russia artificially created a migrant crisis on the Russian-Finnish border in late 2023 as part of its hybrid operations.[92] Zakharova claimed that Western statements about the migrant crisis are \u201cunfounded\u201d and provocative. ISW assessed that Russia created a migrant crisis on the Finnish border in late 2023 by funneling migrants to the Russian-Finnish border as a hybrid warfare tactic meant to destabilize NATO and the EU.[93]\n\nThe Kremlin is re-injecting its longstanding false narratives about \u201cneo-Nazism\u201d in Ukraine on state media channels that specifically target international audiences, likely as part of Russian efforts to convince Western decisionmakers to self-deter and not provide military assistance to Ukraine. The Russian MFA stated that Russian state media outlet RT will air a \u201cdocumentary\u201d about Nazis in Ukraine during the Second World War and in contemporary Ukraine.[94]\n\nSignificant activity in Belarus (Russian efforts to increase its military presence in Belarus and further integrate Belarus into Russian-favorable frameworks and Wagner Group activity in Belarus)\n\nNothing significant to report.\n\nNote: ISW does not receive any classified material from any source, uses only publicly available information, and draws extensively on Russian, Ukrainian, and Western reporting and social media as well as commercially available satellite imagery and other geospatial data as the basis for these reports.

        "text": "U.S. Voter Confidence is Down. Here\u2019s How to Restore It.\nCredit: Andrey Popov \u2013 iStock.com - iStock.com\n\n\n\nEight years ago, a World Justice Project poll found that an overwhelming majority of Americans\u201391%\u2013believed they could vote freely without being harassed or pressured. After the 2020 election, only 58% of people still agreed. Will 2024 be different?\n\nAhead of the November presidential election, the World Justice Project (WJP) will again conduct its U.S. general population poll and ask Americans how they feel about voting. It remains to be seen if their confidence has rebounded at all or fallen further still.\n\n\u201cWhat is clear,\u201d says WJP Executive Director Elizabeth Andersen, \u201cis that now is a critical moment to restore voter confidence in the security and fairness of our elections. The strength of U.S. democracy requires people to trust the election system, that every vote counts, and that the process is governed by the rule of law.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is no surprise that Americans have lost confidence in the election system, according to leading election law expert Richard L. Hasen of the University of California at Los Angeles. In his view, intense polarization and relentless claims of a \u201crigged\u201d 2020 election are considerable drivers of the decline. So what can be done?\n\n\u201cThe most important thing is to continue to try to run free and fair elections, where all eligible voters can easily cast a vote that will be fairly and accurately counted,\u201d Hasen said. \u201cIt is also important to provide voters with reliable information so that they know that most claims of rigged or stolen elections are not based in truth.\u201d\n\nThat may be harder than ever in what Hasen calls the era of \u201ccheap speech,\u201d where false claims can easily go viral on social media.\n\nConcerns about potential violence at the ballot box are another possible driver of falling voter confidence. After heavily armed militias made chilling showings at the 2017 \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in Charlottesville and incendiary rhetoric continued to fester, many jurisdictions became concerned that armed protesters could seek to intimidate voters in 2020.\n\nTools for all 50 states\n\nThousands flocked to the website of Georgetown Law\u2019s Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection (ICAP), which created national and state-by-state resources for law enforcement and election officials to identify and address voter intimidation and any illegal paramilitary behavior.\n\n\u201cParamilitary groups are not protected by the Constitution and actually are outlawed in all 50 states,\u201d said Jacob Glick, ICAP\u2019s policy counsel.\n\nIn 2024, ICAP experts think risks of Election Day violence could even be higher than they were in 2020, when limited paramilitary activity occurred during ballot counting in Arizona. Violence only came later, during the January 6th attack on the Capitol.\n\nBut despite many successful prosecutions, including convictions of the leaders of the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys, the locus and nature of the threat has evolved, ICAP says.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the infusion of that paramilitary mindset, for lack of a better word, enter the public square in ways that it was unable to do in 2020, because it was still so far outside the mainstream,\u201d said Glick, who previously served on the Congressional staff of the January 6th Committee.\n\nDefusing threats\n\nICAP experts point out that violent rhetoric and intimidation tactics have escalated around a variety of politically charged issues. New trends have included death threats against school board members, bomb threats against bookstores hosting drag story hours, and harassment and attacks against U.S. Muslims and Jews amidst the Israel-Gaza conflict.\n\nSo ICAP is developing new resources to address new threats in the lead up to the 2024 election. But the team also sees some silver linings.\n\n\u201cIt is disheartening to hear that the faith in the ability to vote in a free and fair election has gone down so dramatically,\u201d said ICAP Special Litigation Counsel Rupa Bhattacharyya. \u201cBut I do think there's a lot of self-fulfilling prophecy there, partly because there is so much attention being paid to these issues\u2013for very good reasons.\u201d\n\nShe also noted that there was no large increase in violence at the polls in 2022, which bodes well for the continued capacity to hold fair and free elections.\n\nPiggybacking on that bit of good news, Glick said there\u2019s another important reason for voters to feel confident: \u201cIn our Constitutional system, our legal system already has the tools to deal with and defuse these threats before they spiral out of control.\u201d\n\nICAP will continue training law enforcement agencies on how they can effectively contain intimidation tactics within the bounds of the First and Second Amendments.\n\nHere are actions you can take:\n\nMake sure you are registered to vote. It\u2019s easy to check on the Vote.org website, where you can also find out how to register if the answer is no.\n\nVolunteer to be a poll worker. Find out how at helpamericavote.gov, where the U.S. Election Assistance Commission offers a state-by-state tool under the heading \u201cBe Part of Democracy. Help America Vote.\u201d\n\nGet trained to serve as a legal expert. The national, nonpartisan Election Protection coalition trains thousands of lawyers to staff voter assistance call centers. The American Bar Association is also recruiting lawyers and law students to be election workers via Poll Worker, Esq.\n\nHelp a young person register to vote. That\u2019s among 24 recommendations from the Tufts CIRCLE Growing Voters project aimed at empowering the next generation of voters. Over 8 million Americans who were too young to vote in 2020 will turn 18 before the 2024 election.\n\nLearn to spot disinformation. Read about 2024 disinformation risks in Common Cause\u2019s Storm Watch report and how artificial intelligence (AI) can make disinformation even harder to spot via the Campaign Legal Center.\n\nStay informed.

        "text": "CBS News poll finds big majority of Americans support U.S. taking steps to reduce climate change\nRecord heat, hurricanes, wildfires all have been making news in recent years. And while not everyone agrees events like these are the direct result of climate change, they do connect to peoples' opinions about it: a big majority of Americans feel the U.S. needs to address climate change, with those who report experiencing extreme weather more likely to say we should do so right now.\n\nViews on climate change have long been associated with partisanship, and they still are, but age is a factor, too. Younger Americans, including younger Republicans, are even more likely to say the U.S. needs to take steps to at least try to slow it.\n\nThere's a sense of urgency from many in the public, too. A large majority think it needs to be addressed at least in the next few years, including half who think it needs to be addressed right now.\n\nThere's the sense that we should address climate change, and there's also some belief that we can.\n\nThat extends down to the personal level, too. Most Americans believe humans can do something to at least slow the effects of climate change, and those who think so feel they personally have a responsibility to do something about it.\n\nExtreme weather and climate change\n\nPeople who report having experienced extreme weather in their area in recent years \u2014 which is half the country \u2014 are more inclined than those who haven't to believe climate change is a major factor contributing to extreme weather, and more of them see the issue as one that needs to be addressed right away.\n\nAnd even if people don't experience the extreme weather themselves, such events can spark concern. When people hear about the earth experiencing the warmest temperatures on record, more than half say it makes them more concerned about climate change. Those who don't see climate change as a factor in extreme weather are less persuaded by this, including some who don't believe that the earth's temperature is rising.\n\nYounger people and the political divides on climate change\n\nMajorities across all age groups favor the U.S. taking steps to address climate change, but it's people under age 45 \u2014 many who say they were taught about climate change in school \u2014 who are especially likely to be in support of the country taking action.\n\nThere have long been political divisions on addressing climate change, with Democrats expressing more concern than Republicans. These continue today, to some extent. Democrats are more than twice as likely as Republicans to say climate change needs to be addressed right now. And Democrats overwhelmingly support the U.S. taking steps to reduce climate change, but Republicans are divided on that.\n\nDivisions in the GOP on climate?\n\nThe divides within the rank and file GOP we see are along age and ideological lines. Most younger Republicans \u2014 those under age 45 \u2014 support the U.S. taking steps slow or stop climate change, while most older Republicans do not\n\nMore moderate Republicans also see climate change as more pressing than those who are more conservative.\n\nAnd like the public overall, Republicans who report having experienced extreme weather in their local area are more likely to think climate change needs to be addressed.\n\nThis CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,230 U.S. adult residents interviewed between April 16-19, 2024. The sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, and education based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as past vote. The margin of error is \u00b12.7 points.\n\nToplines",

        "text": "U.S. DOL Releases Final Overtime Rule\u2014Effective July 2024\nSeyfarth synopsis: Today, the U.S. DOL unveiled its final overtime rule. The rule significantly increases the minimum salary for so-called \u201cwhite collar\u201d employees to be exempt from the federal FLSA\u2019s overtime pay requirements. This development requires attention from virtually all employers.\n\nThe DOL\u2019s final overtime rule, Defining and Delimiting the Exemptions for Executive, Administrative, Professional, Outside Sales, and Computer Employees, revises the Fair Labor Standard Act\u2019s overtime exemptions for executive, administrative, professional, and highly compensated employees. Effective July 1, 2024, an executive, administrative, or professional employee must receive a salary equivalent to $43,888 per year in order to be classified as exempt. This will increase to $58,656 on January 1, 2025. Meanwhile, the annual compensation threshold for the highly compensated employee exemption will increase to $132,964 on July 1, 2024, and then again to $151,164 on January 1, 2025.\n\nThese numbers are higher than what the DOL previewed in its August 2023 proposed rule. And they represent a significant jump from the current $35,568 salary level for executive, administrative, and professional employees, and the $107,432 minimum compensation level for highly compensated employees.\n\nThese significant increases will have substantial implications and impacts across industries and command employers\u2019 attention.\n\nThe Changes\n\nThe final rule presents three core changes to the rules framing whether and when an employee may be classified as exempt from the FLSA\u2019s overtime pay requirements:\n\nIncreased salary for \u201cwhite collar\u201d employees: The proposed rule increases the minimum salary level from $684 per week ($35,568 per year) to $844 per week ($43,888) effective July 1, 2024, and to $1,128 ($58,656) effective January 1, 2025. Increased total compensation threshold for the \u201cHCE\u201d exemption: The rule raises the total annual compensation requirement for the highly compensated employee exemption from $107,432 to $132,964 by July 1, 2024, and to $151,164 by January 1, 2025. Automatic updating every three years: The rule implements a triennial automatic update to these thresholds, designed, the DOL says, to align with shifts in worker salaries and provide employers with a predictable timetable for future adjustments. The updates will begin on July 1, 2027, and then occur every three years thereafter.\n\nAs expected, the changes leave the \u201cduties\u201d tests for the exemptions untouched. So, as before, an employee generally must meet both the duties and pay requirements of at least one exemption in order to be classified as exempt.\n\nThe Rule\u2019s Road Ahead\n\nThe final rule will go up on the Federal Register for public inspection before formal publication, likely in the next few days.\n\nThe rule will face challenges in courts and potential scrutiny in the event of presidential administration turnover following the November 2024 election. It is worth remembering that the Obama Administration\u2019s 2016 rule revising the FLSA exemptions in a similar fashion\u2014i.e., an increased salary threshold with automatic, inflation-based increases\u2014was stymied by legal challenges and a new administration and never came into effect.\n\nThe DOL\u2019s new rule is not immune to similar challenges, particularly as we approach another election cycle where compensation issues often become political footballs. Depending on Congress\u2019s make up, the rule might also face challenges under the Congressional Review Act.\n\nNext Steps for Employers\n\nDespite likely legal challenges, employers cannot and should not bank on their success. Businesses must prepare for a final rule that takes effect on July 1, 2024, with a more pronounced change on January 1, 2025. While there are major variables in the upcoming presidential election, employers need to prepare for the current finalized rule.\n\nEmployers should promptly develop an accurate picture and understanding of their exempt workforce\u2014i.e., what roles it comprises, how many incumbents occupy the roles, where they are located, what functions they perform, and, of course, how much they are paid. Understanding the contours of the exempt population will allow employers to begin thinking strategically to identify and triage the roles that are most impacted by the new rule or that otherwise command attention during this time of change.\n\nEmployers should partner with their attorneys internally and externally to understand how these changes affect their workforce. Seyfarth is on the cutting edge of these changes, with its comment on the proposed rule having been cited by DOL 17 times in the preamble to the final version. With the new rule, many exempt employees will become non-exempt, implicating a new set of state-by-state laws with which to comply. Employers may need to consider other workforce changes, as well as important training and communication strategies.",

        "text": "Smart Take | India's General Elections 2024: Prime Minister Modi Seeks Third Consecutive Term\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for clarity.\n\nIt's been a decade that Narendra Modi has been in power. He remains quite popular. This, of course, has been his second term that he's about to complete. He remains quite popular, despite how controversial he has been, in the eyes of many. And I think that if he is reelected and it's a very strong chance that he will be back, for a third term. The concerns that many have had about India will grow.\n\nIt's very well known that we have seen during Modi's term in power space for dissent shrink. We have seen growing crackdowns on dissent. And what's particularly concerning, for many observers of India, is that the country's secular traditions, which are constitutionally protected, appear to be, under peril due to Prime Minister Modi's strong emphasis on what is widely regarded as Hindu nationalism.\n\nIt's not surprising that many opposition leaders, including Rahul Gandhi, the head of the Congress party, have built a campaign plank around this idea of needing to move forward and build an India that actually is supportive of all Indians, regardless of religion and so on. And that clearly is taking a very strong, you know, a very different position, from the one that that Modi has taken.\n\nBut the opposition, I would argue, in India is at the end of the day, relatively weak and divided. And you don't have any really strong, charismatic opposition leaders that can capitalize on these vulnerabilities for the Modi government and use that against the Modi government. If he wins, he'll have a fresh mandate, likely a very strong mandate to continue to carry out the policies that he has been putting out there over his decade in power. And that suggests to me that this trend that we've seen that includes, a, a significant threat to democracy, we will see that continue.",

        "text": "The Elections Workforce: How Many Election Workers are there Nationwide? \u2013 Elections & Voting Information Center\nClip from a game show never to be aired:\n\nAnnouncer: \u201c26,824. Is that your final answer, Professor Gronke?\u201d\n\nGronke: \u201cLet me use my lifeline.\u201d\n\nClock ticks \u2026\n\nGronke: \u201c16840.43. That\u2019s my final answer!\u201d\n\nAnnouncer: \u201cYour final answer to the question `How many election workers\n\nthere are in the United States is 16840 point 43??\u201d\n\nGronke: \u201cOk, around 20,000. I am very confident that there are around 20,000\n\nelection workers in the United States. Or maybe a few thousand more \u2026\u201d\n\nAnnouncer: On to our next contestant!\n\nThe scenario above may never appear on television, but the question is a real one, and one that evades a good answer because there is so little systematic information about the size and composition of the elections workforce.\n\nThis post and future posts will provide information about the elections workforce, drawing on results from the 2023 Elections & Voting Information Center (EVIC) Local Election Official (LEO) Survey. We hope this will contribute to efforts to improve the size, diversity, and professionalization in that workforce, and spur other efforts to improve our knowledge base about staff to monitor progress moving forward.\n\nWhy Does the Election Workforce Matter?\n\nThe quality of American democracy and the integrity of our election system relies in large part on the efforts of the elections workforce: local elections officials (LEOs) and their staff who administer elections in the fifty states, territories, indigenous areas, and in more than ten thousand counties, townships, municipalities, and other administrative units. A long research record has shown that voters express higher confidence in our election system when they have a good voting experience and when poll workers and other election officials are knowledgeable and professional. Election officials and their staffs also act as key intermediaries between political candidates and other groups who want access to the ballot to compete for public support.\n\nA well-trained and professional election workforce is vital to American democracy and it is encouraging to see increasing attention to harassment and turnover among staff, as well as policy and research initiatives dedicated to the issue.\n\nHow Many Staff?\n\nAs valuable as these efforts are, they are hampered by a lack of systematic information about elections staff.\n\nOne place to start would seem to be the most basic: how many elections staff are there?\n\nThat seemingly simple question was posed to EVIC in September 2023, while the 2023 LEO Survey hit the field. And it is a question that we should be able to answer since we have been asking about the size of Full Time Employees (FTEs) in elections offices since 2019.\n\nThis survey question results in this powerful figure below, showing that more than half of the elections offices in the country have zero or one full-time staff person, and 90% have 5 or fewer staff members.\n\nWe can use these responses to produce a first estimate of the total elections staff, and putting aside some details (see the Appendix), 26,824 is the answer we provided. Once we adjust for the largest jurisdictions in the country, \u201caround 30,000\u201d was a defensible answer.\n\nBut then research and learning intervened.\n\nWe discovered something well-known to practitioners but not brought home to us until we were in the midst of a staffing study commissioned by the State of Oregon. Asking about FTEs in a local office that administers elections will inevitably capture FTEs that work on the property recording side. In some cases, these duties are split, and LEOs engage in \u201cstaff sharing\u201d (explicitly moving a staff member from recording over to elections during peak periods).\n\nWe asked about this in the 2023 LEO Survey, and the results showed over a quarter of offices engaged in staff sharing. The larger the office, the more common staff sharing is going on (because the smallest offices don\u2019t have staff to \u201cshare\u201d \u2013 everyone does everything).\n\nA second question added to the 2023 survey tries to elicit a more precise estimate of elections staff :\n\n\u201cOf the full-time staff, how many are fully dedicated to elections?\u201d\n\nThe responses to this question are quite striking when compared to the figure above. Notably:\n\n32% of all jurisdictions in the country have \u201cno full-time staff\u201d and consequently, \u201czero\u201d full-time staff dedicated to elections.\n\nand consequently, \u201czero\u201d full-time staff dedicated to elections. 18% of all jurisdictions have one full-time staff member (the LEO) and half of those are not fully dedicated to elections.\n\n(the LEO) and half of those are not fully dedicated to elections. 40% of all jurisdictions have 2 \u2013 5 staff, and 37.5% of those tell us \u201cnone\u201d of the staff are fully dedicated to elections full-time.\n\nThere are even a small number of larger jurisdictions (100,001-250,000) that do not have a single dedicated elections specialist. Such is the reality of balancing election administration with recording, licensing, budgets, and the other myriad duties assigned to LEOs nationwide.\n\nThis question was my \u201clifeline\u201d \u2014 it allowed me to adjust the staffing estimate (described in more detail in the Appendix). This is my nearly \u201cfinal answer\u201d of 16,840.43.\n\nAdd some wiggle room to adjust for the largest jurisdictions, for an ultimate answer of \u201can election workforce somewhere around 20,000.\u201d\n\nIf It Is Good Enough For Horseshoes \u2026 How To Get Better Estimates of Elections Staff\n\nOur intuition is that there are somewhere between 20,000 and 25,000 elections staff nationwide, without considering additional complications like staff sharing, temporary workers, and poll workers. However, getting to that estimate required some fairly heroic assumptions.\n\nWe know that state and local governments face workforce challenges. We know that elected officials and election workers face unprecedented levels of threats and harassments for simply doing their jobs.\n\nWe believe that the research community can do better.\n\nEVIC can do better by improving the LEO Survey.\n\nWe can ask more precise questions about staffing. In our defense, since the inception of the LEO Survey in 2018, we have labored to make the survey instrument short and easy to complete, avoiding anything that necessitates a LEO looking something up offline. However, conversations with practitioners have convinced us that most LEOs will have a good sense of the size of their staff, and those good senses will be better than the categories we have used in the past. Barry Burden, PhD, of the University of Wisconsin Elections Research Center has successfully used a more specific item in surveys of Wisconsin clerks that we could adapt.\n\n\n\nWe can ask more precise questions about staffing.

The Census Bureau and U.S .Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) can do better by coding election work and election workers.\n\nTwo resources to track employment and wages in local government are the Census of Local Governments and the Bureau of Labor Statistics National Occupational Employment and Wage Estimates. For reasons we don\u2019t know, neither of these has a category or occupational code for elections.\n\n\n\nTwo resources to track employment and wages in local government are the Census of Local Governments and the Bureau of Labor Statistics National Occupational Employment and Wage Estimates. For reasons we don\u2019t know, neither of these has a category or occupational code for elections. The U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) can do better by collecting information on staff sizes and other workforce information.\n\nThe EAC may consider collecting information on staff sizes and compensation levels, perhaps as an off-year effort separate from the biennial Election Administration and Voting Survey (EAVS), which is already a burdensome instrument.\n\nTechnical Appendix The technical details of these calculations include projecting our survey estimates to the full population of LEOs, and making certain assumptions about the \u201cmultiplier\u201d to use for the response ranges provided in our survey question.\n\nGeneralizing from the survey responses to the overall population is the easy part. Our sample is drawn proportionate to the size of the jurisdiction, to ensure a complete representation of medium-sized and larger-sized jurisdictions. Our sampling weight allows us to produce valid estimates. Sampling and weighting procedures are reported on the EVIC LEO Survey Methodology Page.\n\nThe more difficult part of the puzzle is choosing the appropriate \u201cmultiplier\u201d for each cell in a crosstab of jurisdictions vs. elections staff. To illustrate, consider each of the cells in the table below. Across the columns, we need to choose values to use for \u201cNo full-time staff\u201d, for any category with a range, and for \u201cMore than 50\u201d. We use \u201c.5\u201d for responses of \u201cno full-time staff\u201d, the midpoint for other categories, and \u201c50\u201d for the largest category. (This calculation, by the way, resulted in our \u201cfirst answer\u201d of 26,824.) Looking down the rows, things get more complicated, particularly in the bottom row, \u201cnone are full-time elections\u201d. For example, 18% of our sample (160 respondents) said they had 1 full-time staff person (that generalizes to approximately 1440 jurisdictions). Half of those said \u201cnone\u201d were fully dedicated to elections, and we use .5 of an FTE for these 78 cases.\n\nWe decided to use the .5 adjustment across the whole bottom row, thus (.5 * 1 * 8.8% * 8000) + (.5 * 3.5 * 15% x 8000) + (.5 * 8 * .7% * 8000) + (.5 * 15.5 * .1% * 8000) sums up our staff estimate for the bottom row. It is not clear that .5 is too high or too low.\n\nThe final decision is what to do with \u201cmore than 50\u201d, fully aware that this column represents the 40 largest jurisdictions in the country, and, from personal communications, knowing that some of the very largest have 750-1000 employees.\n\n\n\nUltimately, we expect our estimate to be somewhat low, but we don\u2019t think it is dramatically off the mark. We hope to collect more detailed information in 2024 to test this assumption.",

        "text": "Five things you need to know about Indonesia\u2019s 2024 elections\nThe world\u2019s largest single-day elections were held in Indonesia on 14 February 2024. WFD\u2019s elections expert Tanja Hollstein spoke to WFD Country Director in Indonesia, Ravio Patra, about the elections, which UK Ambassador to Indonesia Dominic Jermey called \u201ca truly epic festival of democracy.\u201d Here are five key takeaways from their discussion on 20 March 2024. 1. It was a historic, record-breaking event\n\nIndonesia\u2019s 2024 general election was monumental, not just within the context of its own history but also on a global scale. It marked a significant milestone in the nation's democratic journey, being the fifth direct election since the fall of Suharto's 32-year New Order regime in 1998. With over 204 million eligible voters called to cast their ballots at 820,000 polling stations, the elections were a massive logistical feat and \u201ca testament to how important democracy is to the Indonesian people.\u201d The 82.39% voter turnout ranks Indonesia well above the global average of 65.6%.\n\n2. Democratic challenges remain and intensify\n\nEchoing global trends, scholars and activists have raised concerns about democratic regression in Indonesia. Weakened opposition, oligarchic dominance, vote-buying, shrinking civic space, and deteriorating human rights conditions are all major challenges that threaten Indonesia\u2019s democracy. Notably, the election took place against a backdrop of what some commentators have viewed as increased governmental interference in the judiciary, especially following the controversial Constitutional Court ruling to lower the age limit of presidential candidates. Chief Judge Anwar Usman was later dismissed from his position for violating the court\u2019s code of ethics in presiding over the case.\n\n3. Dissatisfaction and mistrust have deeper roots\n\nThe factors affecting public trust on the electoral process stretch back long before an electoral campaign kicks off. The behaviour of key political stakeholders plays a significant role. Ahead of the election, President Joko Widodo expanded his governing coalition to include eight of the nine political parties in parliament, which effectively weakened opposition power and limited scrutiny and oversight. Weakened civil society and insignificant political debates created doubts that the elections would \u201cdiscipline the elites.\u201d Previously, the central government had delayed subnational elections and instead appointed interim leaders in 272 local administrations. Some experts have alleged that these appointments impacted electoral integrity negatively as \u201chandpicked interim leaders [...] use the advantages of incumbency to promote central government interests at the expense of others.\u201d\n\n4. Political dynasty is again a major problem\n\nPresident Joko Widodo\u2019s victory in 2014 was celebrated as a win for democracy. His civilian, non-military, and non-political family background contrasted with the New Order regime\u2019s legacy of nepotism and cronyism. Following his re-election in 2019, however, his family began to shift into political careers\u2014marked by his eldest son Gibran Rakabuming\u2019s mayorship in Surakarta, youngest son Kaesang Pangarep\u2019s chairpersonship of the Indonesian Solidarity Party (PSI), and son-in-law Bobby Nasution\u2019s mayorship in Medan. Chief Constitutional Judge Anwar Usman, the president\u2019s brother-in-law, presided over the case that resulted in the lowering of presidential candidates\u2019 age limit, which cleared the way for Gibran Rakabuming to be the running mate of eventual President-elect Prabowo Subianto. Experts have criticised the president for \u201cbending rules to build his political dynasty\u201d which involved \u201ca massive and expensive campaign that [...] co-opted government agencies and programs to promote Prabowo and Gibran\u201d during the election campaign.\n\n5. Young voters and social media were key to victory\n\nMore than half of the eligible voters in this election were aged 17\u201340. This places the younger generation at the heart of Indonesia\u2019s democracy, signifying a dynamic shift in political engagement and potential for future policy direction. To engage with young voters, candidates significantly leveraged social media channels to shape political discourse and electoral outcomes, with President-elect Prabowo Subianto spending double in social media advertisement than his two competitors combined. As young voters tend to \u201crely on social media and the influence of their peers\u201d in accessing information, misinformation and disinformation remain a big problem. In fact, it has become more sophisticated and harder to identify and address in this election. These phenomena reflect a global trend where information literacy and engagement are increasingly becoming a decisive factor in political campaigns\u2014offering new avenues for voter engagement and participation.\n\nTo sum up\n\nSince transitioning from the authoritarian New Order regime, Indonesia has embarked on a path of progressive democratic reforms. The introduction of term limits for presidents and local leaders, implementation of legislated quota for women\u2019s candidacy in elections, and establishment of key accountability institutions (e.g., the Corruption Eradication Commission, Commission on Violence against Women, Constitutional Court, and Judicial Commission) signify Indonesia's efforts to fortify its democracy. These reforms aim to enhance political inclusivity, accountability, and transparency within the domestic political landscape, laying the foundation for a more robust democratic governance structure.\n\nThe 2024 general elections encapsulated the successes and challenges of Indonesia's democratic evolution. They highlighted the nation's commitment to democratic participation, the significant role of the youth in shaping the future political direction, and the ongoing efforts towards democratic reforms. However, it also brought to light the critical challenges that need addressing to safeguard the integrity of Indonesia's democracy.\n\nThe story is far from over, with the Constitutional Court\u2019s proceedings on the election dispute case brought forward by the losing presidential candidates still ongoing.",

The project is expected to take 14 months to complete. Officials are hopeful the new headquarters will be open and operational by mid-summer 2025. Riley County Commissioners approved the proposed $11.7M budget, which will be allocated from American Rescue Plan Act funds distributed to Riley County.The new facility will house administrative services and Station #1 for Riley County Emergency Medical Services. The space will include a training and conference room, a full-time staffed ambulance, backup ambulances, on-duty supervisor, and quarters for on-duty EMS staff.\u201cThe new headquarters building will allow our staff to move around the bays and work on their equipment indoors instead of moving the ambulances outside to clean and maintain. Also important, administration will be in the same building as our staff, and each person on a 24-hour shift will have their own individual bunk room,\u201d explained David Adams, EMS Director.The new EMS headquarters facility was designed by Archimages of Lenexa, KS.

        "text": "Canada will take bigger economic hit than U.S. if Trump wins election: report - National\nCanada stands to bear a greater economic burden than the United States if Donald Trump wins the upcoming presidential election and imposes promised tax cuts and tariffs on all U.S. imports, a new report warns.\n\nThe analysis released Tuesday by Scotiabank Economics says if Trump returns to the White House and follows through on his vow to slap a 10-per cent tariff on all imported goods \u2014 with the exception of China, which would face a 60-per cent carve-out on its U.S. exports \u2014 and countries retaliate with their own, there would be \u201csubstantial negative impacts\u201d on the U.S. economy. GDP would likely fall by more than two per cent by 2027 relative to current forecasts, while inflation would rise 1.5 per cent, leading to a two per cent interest rate hike.\n\nIn Canada, the economic impact would be even more stark with an expected GDP drop of 3.6 per cent, given its reliance on trade with the U.S. Inflation and interest rates would also be pushed up for the next two years \u2014 1.7 per cent and 190 basis points, respectively \u2014 the report suggests.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cWhat Trump is looking to do is much broader, and much more concerning, than the tariffs he imposed during his first term,\u201d said Scotiabank\u2019s chief economist Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Perrault, who authored the report.\n\n9:36 Canada speaking with Trump allies in U.S. to prepare for possible second term: Ambassador Hillman\n\nThe report also serves as another reminder that Canada needs to urgently address its issues with lagging productivity, warning the problem makes Canada more vulnerable to economic shocks brought by trade policy changes in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nPerrault says it\u2019s far too late to fix the problem in time for the U.S. election in November.\n\n\u201cIt takes a long time to change direction on productivity,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cMaybe you can make up some ground over the next few quarters, but we need massive amounts of progress to get to where we need to be (to withstand U.S. economic shocks).\u201d\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nTrump's policies seen as more likely than Biden's\n\nAlthough the analysis examined the impact of policies proposed by both Trump and U.S. President Joe Biden, it focuses more on the fallout from Trump\u2019s promises.\n\nGet daily National news Get the day's top news, political, economic, and current affairs headlines, delivered to your inbox once a day.

Trump\u2019s proposals, meanwhile, are seen as more likely to be implemented quickly and without congressional approval, particularly his expanded tariffs.\n\nDuring his presidency, Trump imposed tariffs on about US$50 billion worth of Chinese goods imported to the U.S., later expanding to another US$300 billion, sparking a trade war with China. Many of those tariffs have remained in place under the Biden administration.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nTrump also slapped tariffs up to 25 per cent on imported washing machines, solar panels, steel and aluminum in 2018. Canada and Mexico were later exempted from the steel and aluminum tariffs in 2019, although the Canadian aluminum tariff was briefly reintroduced in 2020.\n\n1:17 \u2018No guarantees\u2019 in trading relationship with Trump administration, Freeland says\n\nU.S. government data shows those tariffs \u2014 none of which were legislated or approved by Congress \u2014 have cost American manufacturers more than US$230 billion as of March 2024 and have shrunk the U.S. economy by 0.3 per cent.\n\nTrump has repeatedly claimed tariffs serve to punish unfair trade practices from other countries, despite agreement among economists that they raise prices for American consumers, and says he wants to expand them to 10 per cent on all imported goods from every country if he wins in November. He has also said he will seek a 100 per cent tariff on imported cars, and carve out a 60 per cent tariff for Chinese imports specifically.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe most likely scenario \u2014 a continuation of Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts beyond their 2025 expiration combined with across-the-board tariffs \u2014 would see Canada\u2019s GDP stay three per cent lower long-term, and just over one-per cent lower in the U.S.\n\nThe Scotiabank report says the economic harm from the tariffs can be reduced on both sides of the Canada-U.S. border if Canada and Mexico negotiate an exemption with the U.S. under the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA), which replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) during the Trump administration.\n\nScotiabank predicts in that scenario, Canada\u2019s GDP would only fall by 1.4 per cent in the short term \u2014 half the drop forecast without an exemption \u2014 and 0.3 per cent in the long term, while U.S. GDP would fall 1.7 per cent and 1.2 per cent, respectively.\n\nPerrault says he\u2019s \u201chopeful\u201d such a carve-out could be negotiated, even though Trump would likely insist on further concessions that benefit U.S. trade. That \u201cbigger stick\u201d approach could be somewhat limited compared to the contentious CUSMA negotiations, however.\n\n\u201cTrump owns CUSMA, so he wouldn\u2019t be in as much of a position to throw it away,\u201d he said. \u201cSo maybe we get a little bit of a break.\u201d\n\n1:59 Trudeau says Canada to remain the same as previous Trump term in office, should former president return in 2024\n\nThe report also examines the impact of Trump\u2019s repeated vow to mass deport roughly 10 million undocumented immigrants living illegally in the U.S., which Perrault admits would be \u201cpolitically and logistically infeasible.\u201d It would also be economically harmful, the analysis found, permanently reducing both U.S. employment and GDP by three per cent, though the impact on Canada would be negligible.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe analysis says Canada and the U.S. could see additional economic impacts due to a number of scenarios it didn\u2019t explore, including China retaliating to tariffs by unloading its U.S. Treasury holdings; further debt ceiling and budgetary crises in the U.S.; Trump\u2019s appeasement of aggressive foreign adversaries like Russia and China; and domestic civil disorder regardless of who wins the U.S. elections.\n\nPerrault said the findings also underscore the key difference between Trump and Biden as Canadian trade partners.\n\n\u201cBiden seems to view negotiations from a collaborative approach: how can everyone come away with a win?\u201d he said. \u201cTrump doesn\u2019t see it that way. He\u2019s very much in the mindset of, \u2018How will this benefit me?'\u201d",

        "text": "When is the 2024 Pennsylvania primary? Date, who's on the ballot, how to vote by mail\nHow Philadelphia DA's Office plans to keep city safe on primary day\n\nHow Philadelphia DA's Office plans to keep city safe on primary day\n\nHow Philadelphia DA's Office plans to keep city safe on primary day\n\nPHILADELPHIA (CBS) -- Pennsylvania's 2024 primary election is Tuesday and it's important to have all the information you need before casting your ballot.\n\nYou don't have to do it all at the last minute. We're going to list out everything you need to know about when the primary election is, when and where to vote, and of course, who's running.\n\nWhat is the date of the 2024 Pennsylvania primary?\n\nThe Pennsylvania primary election is set for April 23, 2024. The polls will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.\n\nIf you plan to vote by mail, your ballot is due in your county's elections office by 8 p.m. on April 23.\n\nCan I still register to vote in Pennsylvania? Where do I vote?\n\nAt this point, all deadlines to register to vote in the primary and applications for mail-in or absentee ballots have passed.\n\nHowever, if you recently renewed your driver's license, you might already be registered to vote. Pennsylvania implemented \"motor voter\" rules at the commonwealth's driver's license centers last year.\n\nUnder the new rules that took effect in September 2023, drivers are prompted to register to vote when they receive or renew a driver's license.\n\nYou can check if you're registered to vote and where your polling place is in Pennsylvania using this \"Find voter registration status\" form on the Pennsylvania Department of State's website, Vote.PA.Gov.\n\nIf you have polling place issues you can call (215)-686-VOTE. If you need assistance with voter intimidation or legal issues in Philadelphia, you can call the district attorney's office at (215)-686-9641.\n\nWhat is a primary election?\n\nIn a primary election, voters decide which political candidate will run in a general election. In Pennsylvania, you can only vote for the candidate under the party that you are registered with.\n\nWhile the state's primary election usually takes place in May, during presidential years the primary election is held on the fourth Tuesday of April.\n\nSince this is a presidential year, each political party will hold a convention where they choose their nominee for president based on the results of primary elections.\n\nMost common reasons mail ballots are thrown out: don't send a naked ballot\n\nIf you're voting by mail, you have to do it right - follow the instructions to the letter, or your vote might not count.\n\nPennsylvania's vote-by-mail process has been the subject of lawsuits over whether certain errors on ballots invalidate them. So don't let your ballot be one of them.\n\nAccording to the Pennsylvania Department of State, over 16,000 mail-in ballots in the November 2022 election were thrown out due to errors including the wrong date, lack of a signature, no date, or no security envelope (also known as a \"naked ballot\").\n\nIn the 2023 primary, over 17,000 mail ballots were rejected, amounting to about 2.8% of the 597,000 mail ballots cast.\n\nSecretary of the Commonwealth Al Schmidt announced a ballot redesign last year aimed at reducing the number of rejections.\n\nHere are some of the most common mail-in ballot errors with a brief explanation and how to avoid them:\n\nNaked ballot\n\nA naked ballot means it's missing the security envelope. In the Instagram Reel above, Montgomery County Director of Voter Services Dori Sawyer showed CBS Philadelphia's Kim Hudson how to properly fill out a mail ballot.\n\nOnce you've made the selections on your ballot, first put it in the inner security envelope.\n\nThen that security envelope goes in the larger labeled envelope that you mail back to your county elections office (or drop in a mail-in ballot drop box).\n\nSolution: Put your mail-in ballot in the inner security envelope and then put it in the outer, signed and dated, envelope before sending.\n\nNo date or wrong date\n\nProblem: Mail-in ballots must be marked in the date field with the date you are mailing them - which has to be before Election Day. A lot of people have been writing their birthdate in this field - but it should be a date in March or April 2024 - prior to April 23.\n\nThe redesigned ballots have the date field pre-filled with a \"20\" in the year position - to avoid people writing their birthdate, according to Schmidt's office.\n\nSolution: Put the correct date, the date you are returning/mailing your ballot, in the date field.\n\nNo signature\n\nSome people also returned the mail-in ballot without a signature.\n\nSolution: Sign your ballot!\n\nWho is on the 2024 Pennsylvania primary ballot?\n\nPresident\n\nThe battleground state's primary election is relatively late, and Republican Donald Trump is currently running unopposed since former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley suspended her 2024 GOP presidential campaign in early March.\n\nDemocrat Joe Biden is also running unopposed in the primary. This comes as his remaining challenger Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesota dropped his long-shot Democratic primary bid against Biden in early March.\n\nSenate\n\nDemocrat U.S. Sen. Bob Casey does not face a primary opponent and neither does Republican challenger David McCormick. Control of the U.S. Senate is on the line in 2024, and Casey's bid for a fourth term is expected to be one of the nation's most expensive and closely watched races.\n\nPrimary voters will also have to make their choices in other races.\n\nCongress\n\nAll 17 incumbents \u2014 nine Democrats and eight Republicans \u2014 are running for reelection in Pennsylvania's 17 congressional seats.\n\nOnly a handful of the seats are expected to be competitive in the November general election.\n\nIn the primary, just five have a direct challenger from within their party: Democratic Rep. Dwight Evans of Philadelphia, Pittsburgh-area Democratic U.S. Rep. Summer Lee and Republican U.S. Reps. Mike Kelly of Butler and Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Bucks County.\n\nEvans is facing former Philadelphia Register of Wills Tracey Gordon to lead the 3rd District encompassing several areas of Philadelphia.\n\nFitzpatrick's bid for reelection is also gaining attention. He is facing a challenge from Mike Houck for his 1st District seat. The winner will face Democratic challenger Ashley Ehasz.\n\nIn the 7th District in eastern Pennsylvania, three Republicans are vying for the nomination to challenge Democratic U.S. Rep. Susan Wild of Allentown. They are state Rep. Ryan MacKenzie, IT firm owner Kevin Dellicker and lawyer Maria Montero.\n\nMeanwhile, in southcentral Pennsylvania's 10th District, six Democrats are seeking the nomination to challenge Republican U.S. Rep. Scott Perry of York County. They are former public radio executive Blake Lynch, business consultant John Broadhurst, former TV news personality Janelle Stelson, Harrisburg City Council member Shamaine Daniels, retired Marine Corps pilot Michael O'Brien and Rick Coplen, a teacher and retired Army officer.\n\nAttorney general\n\nFive Democrats filed for the party's primary.\n\nThey include state Rep. Jared Solomon of Philadelphia, Delaware County District Attorney Jack Stollsteimer, former state Auditor General Eugene DePasquale, former federal prosecutor Joe Khan and Keir Bradford-Grey, the former head of Philadelphia's and Montgomery County's public defense lawyers.\n\nOn the Republican side, York County's district attorney, Dave Sunday, and state Rep. Craig Williams of Delaware County filed to run.\n\nTreasurer\n\nStacy Garrity, the Republican incumbent, filed to run for a second four-year term. On the Democratic side, two filed to run: state Rep. Ryan Bizarro of Erie and Erin McClelland, a two-time congressional candidate in suburban Pittsburgh who has helped run various human services organizations.\n\nAuditor general\n\nThe Republican incumbent, Tim DeFoor, filed to run for a second four-year term. On the Democratic side, two filed to run: state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta of Philadelphia and Lehigh County Controller Mark Pinsley.\n\nPrimary elections in New Jersey and Delaware\n\nIn New Jersey, voters will cast their primary ballots on June 4 and the deadline to register is set for May 14.\n\nDelaware canceled its primary that was initially set for April 2 after lawmakers approved the legislation in March. The primary was not seen as needed because Biden and Trump, the prevailing presidential candidates, do not have challengers within their party.

                "description": "NOTICE: On April 23, 2024, the U.S. Department of Labor (Department) announced a final rule, Defining and Delimiting the Exemptions for Executive, Administrative, Professional, Outside Sales, and Computer Employees , which will take effect on July 1, 2024. The final rule updates and revises the regulations issued under section 13(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act implementing the exemption from minimum wage and overtime pay requirements for executive, administrative, and professional (EAP) employees. Revisions include increases to the standard salary level and the highly compensated employee total annual compensation threshold, and a mechanism that provides for the timely and efficient updating of these earnings thresholds to reflect current earnings data. \u00a0 Final Rule Webinar: Restoring and Extending Overtime Protections This webinar provides a general overview of requirements under section 13(a)(1) of the FLSA, and will discuss the final rule's revisions, including scheduled increases to certain earnings thresholds required for exemption. Regla Final: Restablecimiento y ampliaci\u00f3n de la protecci\u00f3n del sobretiempo En este grupo de diapositivas le proporcionaremos una visi\u00f3n general de la Exenci\u00f3n para Ejecutivos, Administrativos y Profesionales. A continuaci\u00f3n, hablaremos de las fechas importantes de la Regla Final 2024, seguidas de los cambios realizados bajo esta Regla Final 2024, al nivel de salario est\u00e1ndar, el nivel de compensaci\u00f3n anual total del empleado de alta compensaci\u00f3n y el Mecanismo de Actualizaci\u00f3n. \u00a0 Employees are exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act\u2019s minimum wage and overtime protections if they are employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity, as those terms are defined in the Department\u2019s regulations at 29 CFR part 541 . To fall within the EAP exemption, an employee generally must meet three tests: be paid a salary, meaning that they are paid a predetermined and fixed amount that is not subject to reduction because of variations in the quality or quantity of work performed; be paid at least a specified weekly salary level; and primarily perform executive, administrative, or professional duties, as provided in the Department\u2019s regulations. The Department\u2019s regulations also provide an alternative test for certain highly compensated employees who are paid a salary, earn above a higher total annual compensation level, and satisfy a minimal duties test. The final rule will increase the standard salary level and the highly compensated employee total annual compensation threshold on the rule\u2019s effective date on July 1, 2024, and on January 1, 2025, when changes in the methodologies used to calculate these levels become applicable. The final rule also provides for future updates of these levels every three years to reflect current earnings data. These scheduled increases are displayed below. DATE STANDARD SALARY LEVEL HIGHLY COMPENSATED EMPLOYEE TOTAL ANNUAL COMPENSATION THRESHOLD Before July 1, 2024 $684 per week (equivalent to $35,568 per year) $107,432 per year, including at least $684 per week paid on a salary or fee basis. July 1, 2024 $844 per week (equivalent to $43,888 per year) $132,964 per year, including at least $844 per week paid on a salary or fee basis.

The final rule updates and revises the regulations issued under section 13(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act implementing the exemption from minimum wage and overtime pay requirements for executive, administrative, and professional (EAP) employees.

To fall within the EAP exemption, an employee generally must meet three tests: be paid a salary, meaning that they are paid a predetermined and fixed amount that is not subject to reduction because of variations in the quality or quantity of work performed; be paid at least a specified weekly salary level; and primarily perform executive, administrative, or professional duties, as provided in the Department\u2019s regulations. The Department\u2019s regulations also provide an alternative test for certain highly compensated employees who are paid a salary, earn above a higher total annual compensation level, and satisfy a minimal duties test. The final rule will increase the standard salary level and the highly compensated employee total annual compensation threshold on the rule\u2019s effective date on July 1, 2024, and on January 1, 2025, when changes in the methodologies used to calculate these levels become applicable.

        "text": "2024 US presidential election\nMost asked questions on US Elections\n\nWhen is the next US presidential election?\n\nThe 2024 US election is scheduled for Tuesday, November 5, 2024.\n\nThe winning candidate will begin a four-year term in the White House in January 2025 following the election.\n\nWho are the candidates?\n\nIn the United States, elections are usually defined between the two main parties, the Republican party and the Democratic party. Each nominates a presidential candidate by holding a series of state primaries and/or caucuses. There are differences between the parties, and the process varies from one state to another.\n\nOne of the biggest polling days is known as Super Tuesday, so-called because more than a dozen states hold their primary contests on that day. This year, it took place on March 5.\n\nPresident Biden announced his re-election bid earlier this year and has won enough support to secure the Democratic Party nomination despite some long-shot challenges.\n\nIn the Republican Party, former President Donald Trump saw off his last remaining challenger, former UN ambassador Nikki Haley, and has won enough primary contests to propel him over the finish line to be nominated the Republican candidate. Some independent candidates are also running for president, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr, nephew to former president John F. Kennedy.\n\nHow does the US presidential election work?\n\nCandidates compete for 538 electoral college votes, with 270 needed to win. Each state's electoral votes, based partly on population, are won by the candidate who wins the most votes there. The winner-takes-all rule applies in most states, meaning the leading candidate receives all of that state's electoral votes. Since most states lean toward one party, attention focuses on battleground states, where either candidate could win.\n\nWho can vote?\n\n18-year-old or older US citizens can vote in the presidential election held every four years.\n\nWhy are general elections held on Tuesday after the first Monday in November?\n\nWhat is the lame-duck period?\n\nElection Day is strategically placed about a month before the Electoral College vote to avoid conflicts with the harvest and harsh weather in agrarian societies. Voting on Tuesday instead of Monday accommodated those travelling to vote, especially those from remote areas, who preferred to avoid traveling on Sunday, a day of religious observance. By choosing the first Tuesday after the first Monday, lawmakers ensured Election Day would be different from November 1, when merchants tallied their monthly accounts.\n\nThe time between elections and the inauguration in the US is called the \"lame duck period.\" A president becomes a lame duck after a successor is elected, during which the outgoing and incoming presidents usually transition power.",

        "text": "Pennsylvania primary election results 2024\nPHILADELPHIA (CBS) \u2014 Polls across Pennsylvania are closed and results for the 2024 primary election are pouring in. See live results of Pennsylvania's attorney general race, U.S. House and other statewide races at the links below.\n\nPa. primary election results\n\nWho was on the 2024 Pennsylvania primary ballot?\n\nPresident\n\nThe battleground state's primary election is relatively late, and Republican Donald Trump is currently running unopposed since former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley suspended her 2024 GOP presidential campaign in early March.\n\nDemocrat Joe Biden is also running unopposed in the primary. This comes as his remaining challenger Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesota dropped his long-shot Democratic primary bid against Biden in early March.\n\nSenate\n\nDemocrat U.S. Sen. Bob Casey did not face a primary opponent, and neither did Republican challenger David McCormick. Control of the U.S. Senate is on the line in 2024, and Casey's bid for a fourth term is expected to be one of the nation's most expensive and closely watched races.\n\nPrimary voters made choices in other races.\n\nCongress\n\nAll 17 incumbents \u2014 nine Democrats and eight Republicans \u2014 are running for reelection in Pennsylvania's 17 congressional seats.\n\nOnly a handful of the seats are expected to be competitive in the November general election.\n\nIn the primary, just five have a direct challenger from within their party: Democratic Rep. Dwight Evans of Philadelphia, Pittsburgh-area Democratic U.S. Rep. Summer Lee and Republican U.S. Reps. Mike Kelly of Butler and Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Bucks County.\n\nIn the 3rd District, Evans defeated Philadelphia Register of Wills Tracey Gordon, the Associated Press projects.\n\nFitzpatrick won the Republican nomination for U.S. House in Pennsylvania's 1st Congressional District, the AP projects.\n\nIn the 7th District in eastern Pennsylvania, three Republicans were vying for the nomination to challenge Democratic U.S. Rep. Susan Wild of Allentown. State Rep. Ryan Mackenzie defeated IT firm owner Kevin Dellicker and lawyer Maria Montero, the AP projects.\n\nMeanwhile, in southcentral Pennsylvania's 10th District, six Democrats sought the nomination to challenge Republican U.S. Rep. Scott Perry of York County: public radio executive Blake Lynch, business consultant John Broadhurst, former TV news personality Janelle Stelson, Harrisburg City Council member Shamaine Daniels, retired Marine Corps pilot Michael O'Brien and Rick Coplen, a teacher and retired Army officer. The AP projects Stelson won.\n\nAttorney general\n\nDemocrat Eugene DePasquale and Republican Dave Sunday won their primary elections for Pennsylvania attorney general Tuesday, the AP projects.\n\nFor the Democrats, the AP projects DePasquale, the former state auditor general, defeated four others, state Rep. Jared Solomon of Philadelphia, Delaware County District Attorney Jack Stollsteimer, former federal prosecutor Joe Khan and Keir Bradford-Grey, the former head of Philadelphia's and Montgomery County's public defense lawyers.\n\nOn the Republican side, Sunday, York County's district attorney, defeated Rep. Craig Williams of Delaware County for the nomination, according to the AP.\n\nTreasurer\n\nDemocrats also nominated Erin McClelland, a two-time congressional candidate in suburban Pittsburgh who has helped run various human services organizations, to challenge Republican state Treasurer Stacy Garrity. McClelland prevailed despite being heavily outspent by her party-endorsed rival.\n\nAuditor general\n\nThe Republican incumbent, Tim DeFoor, filed to run for a second four-year term.\n\nDemocrats nominated State Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta of Philadelphia to challenge DeFoor.",

        "text": "Judith Bronstein elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences\nThe American Academy of Arts and Sciences announced today the election of their newest 250 members, including Judith Bronstein, a University of Arizona Distinguished Professor in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and a BIO5 Institute member.\n\nThe academy was founded in 1780 to help the young nation face challenges through shared purpose, knowledge and ideas. Academy members include those who discover and advance knowledge and those who apply knowledge to the problems of society. More than 14,500 members have been elected since the academy's founding.\n\nImage Judith Bronstein\n\n\"This recognition came out of the blue, and that's the best kind,\" Bronstein said. \"When I look at the list of people in ecology and evolution in the academy, I see so many people I admire and so many old friends. Now, they're all emailing me and saying wonderful things. It's nice to see that my work all these years has made a difference.\"\n\nBronstein was one of the first ecologists to focus on mutually beneficial cooperation between species, called mutualism, and what the various instances of mutualism have in common. As a young faculty member in the early 1990s, she was already the world's foremost expert in the field. Over the years, she has prioritized fostering the careers of younger scientists through mentorship and collaboration. She teaches undergraduate and graduate courses and is currently working on a monograph on mutualism to summarize all that has been gleaned from the field in the decades since her work began.\n\nBronstein was a teenager when Earth Day was first celebrated on April 22, 1970. The event inspired her to make a difference. Later, at Brown University, she took classes in environmental policy and science and found a passion for the world of academia.\n\nShe earned her doctoral degree in ecology and evolutionary biology in 1986 from the University of Michigan. She joined the UArizona faculty in 1989 and was recognized as a University Distinguished Professor in 2012. In 2016, she was elected a Fellow of the Ecological Society of America, and in 2023, she earned the Distinguished Achievement in the Conceptual Unification of the Biological Sciences award from the American Society of Naturalists, a recognition of which she is particularly proud.\n\n\"Judith Bronstein exemplifies the type of scholar and educator dedicated to the goals of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences,\" said Elliott Cheu, interim senior vice president for research and innovation. \"While her work in the area ecology and mutualism is world-famous, her impact on our local community and passion for supporting our local educational system is truly amazing. We are lucky to have such a distinguished faculty member at the University of Arizona.\"\n\n\"I am thrilled for professor Bronstein, and for our department, college and university,\" said Michael Worobey, head of the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology in the College of Science. \"I have had the pleasure of working alongside Judie (Bronstein) in ecology and evolutionary biology for more than 20 years, and she is utterly deserving of this \u2013 one of the highest honors bestowed on scientists in the United States. Judie (Bronstein) is a triple threat; Her teaching, service and research impacts are profound. She does world-class research and scholarship, then works tirelessly to communicate it to others and train new generations of scientists. She is a national treasure, and she embodies exactly what makes universities and academia indispensable institutions, which matter now more than ever.\"\n\nThe American Academy of Arts and Sciences has elected innovative thinkers from each generation, including Benjamin Franklin and Alexander Hamilton in the 18th century; Ralph Waldo Emerson and Maria Mitchell in the 19th; and Robert Frost, Martha Graham, Margaret Mead, Milton Friedman and Martin Luther King Jr. in the 20th. The current membership includes more than 250 Nobel and Pulitzer Prize winners.\n\n\"We honor these artists, scholars, scientists and leaders in the public, nonprofit and private sectors for their accomplishments and for the curiosity, creativity and courage required to reach new heights,\" said David Oxtoby, president of the academy. \"We invite these exceptional individuals to join in the academy's work to address serious challenges and advance the common good.\"\n\nBronstein joins many other UArizona faculty elected to the academy, including Roger Angel, Noam Chomsky, John Hildebrand, Renu Malhotra, George Rieke and Marcia Rieke.\n\nInduction ceremonies for new members will take place in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in September.",

whereas there were reports of voters being intimidated, voters being denied their right to vote, ballot boxes being stuffed, protocols from the precincts being falsified on a massive scale and independent domestic election observers being detained; whereas Russia illegally organised voting in the occupied Ukrainian territories of Crimea, Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia, at times amid violence and threats by armed Russian soldiers; whereas Russia also has a record of organising illegal voting in Abkhazia and South Ossetia and in Transnistria, against the will of the Georgian and Moldovan authorities;\n\nD. whereas the Russian authorities did not invite OSCE/ODIHR to observe its election, which runs contrary to Russia\u2019s commitments and obligations as an OSCE participating state; whereas this was the second Russian election in a row to have been held without impartial and independent international election observers in the country;\n\nE. whereas the Central Electoral Commission of the Russian Federation unreasonably refused to register as candidates any politicians critical of the regime or of the war of aggression, including some who had reportedly collected more than 100 000 signatures, as prescribed by the national legislation;\n\nF. whereas Alexei Navalny, the most powerful figure in the democratic opposition and the 2021 laureate of the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, was murdered in a Siberian penal colony on 16 February 2024, just weeks before the so-called presidential election; whereas Navalny had been serving an unfounded, politically motivated prison sentence; whereas the full responsibility for his murder lies with the Russian state and with its president Vladimir Putin in particular;\n\nG. whereas Russia\u2019s 1993 Constitution limited the president to two consecutive terms of office, but Vladimir Putin has been in power continuously since 2000, finding different ways to circumvent this limit; whereas the sham referendum of 2020 cannot be perceived as valid and was enacted in violation of the laws and international commitments of the Russian Federation; whereas the renewed presidential term of Vladimir Putin is viewed as unconstitutional by numerous experts; whereas since 2022, the Kremlin regime has implemented various restrictive election monitoring laws, while supporters of opposition parties are routinely targeted, detained and often charged, largely under the new law passed in February 2024 permitting property and asset confiscation for any individual criticising the war in Ukraine;\n\nH. whereas Russia\u2019s authoritarian regime has used such increasingly fraudulent and farcical so-called elections for decades to provide a semblance of democracy in order to continue to concentrate all power in the hands of Vladimir Putin; whereas the government suppresses any dissent with the support of loyalist security forces, a subservient judiciary, a state-controlled media environment ensuring a continuous flood of propaganda and disinformation, and a legislature consisting of a ruling party and pliable opposition factions;\n\nI. whereas the other candidates running in this sham election were representatives of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (CPRF), New People, and the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR), and are currently under EU and US sanctions because of their support for the war in Ukraine;\n\nJ. whereas Putin\u2019s \u2018electoral victory\u2019 with 87 % of the vote, a clearly inconceivable number for a free and fair election, derived from a clearly manipulated outcome from polling stations throughout Russia, from Adygea to Yamalo-Nenets; whereas this shows the cavalier and flagrant manner in which elections are misused by the Putin regime to continue into its 24th year in power;\n\nK. whereas since the start of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the Russian authorities have increased their repression of political opposition, the media, civil society and the LGBTIQ community by curtailing rights and individual liberties even further to stifle domestic dissent;\n\nL. whereas many Russian voters bravely expressed their anger at and opposition to the Kremlin regime and the farce it presented as an election by engaging in acts of resistance at polling stations; whereas crowds descended on polling places at noon on the final day of the so-called election in support of the \u2018noon against Putin\u2019 demonstration that Alexei Navalny had also called for before he was murdered in prison after being subjected to torture and inhumane treatment;\n\nM. whereas the Kremlin regime has decimated a generation of Russian civil society, democratic political opposition, and human rights organisations, including Memorial and the Moscow Helsinki Group; whereas the number of political prisoners in Russia, estimated to be at least 1 000, exceeds levels seen even during the late Soviet period, and there has been a significant increase in the number of individuals detained for criticising Putin\u2019s policies, particularly concerning the war in Ukraine; whereas according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, Russia is holding at least 22 journalists in prison;\n\nN. whereas the EU has frequently expressed its unequivocal solidarity with all those dissidents and the Russian people, who, despite the threat to their freedom and their lives and the pressure from the Kremlin and the Russian authorities, continue to fight for freedom, human rights and democracy; whereas the EU hosts a variety of Russian dissidents and representatives of the media and civil society who were forced to leave Russia as their criticism of the government put them at significant risk of retaliation from the authorities;\n\nO. whereas the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Russian Federation has concluded that there is no longer any safe space for civic action or political opposition within Russia;\n\nP. whereas the Venice Commission, in its Opinion No 992/2020, concluded that the speed of the preparation of the 2020 constitutional amendments was clearly inappropriate, that the hastily adopted 2020 amendments to the Constitution of Russia have disproportionately strengthened the position of the president and that the ad hominem exclusion from the term limits of the current and previous presidents contradicts the very logic of the adopted amendment limiting the president\u2019s mandate to two terms;\n\nQ. whereas, in its Resolutions 2519 (2023) and 2540 (2024), the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe called on European governments to recognise Vladimir Putin as illegitimate after the end of his current presidential term and to cease all contact with him, except for humanitarian purposes and in the pursuit of peace;\n\nR. whereas, in its 2021 recommendation on the direction of EU-Russia political relations[1], Parliament concluded that the constitutional changes implemented in June 2020 were illegal, as did the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in its Resolution 2519 (2023);\n\nS. whereas the Russian Federation has been carrying out an illegal, unprovoked and unjustified war of aggression against Ukraine since 24 February 2022; whereas this war of aggression constitutes a blatant and flagrant violation of the UN Charter and of the fundamental principles of international law;\n\nT. whereas on 17 March 2023, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin in view of his responsibility for the war crime of unlawful deportation and transfer of Ukrainian children during Russia\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine;\n\n1. Strongly denounces all electoral violations committed by the regime of Vladimir Putin during the so-called Russian presidential election of 15 to 17 March 2024, as well as the preceding long-standing and systemic repression and violations of civil and political rights; underlines that Russia\u2019s so-called presidential election was held in a climate of fear and repression and in the context of an illegal, unprovoked and unjustified war of aggression against Ukraine; notes that during the so-called presidential election, there were no genuine alternative candidates, no free media, no credible observers and no political freedoms; concludes that the so-called presidential election in Russia was illegitimate and undemocratic;\n\n2. Concludes that this farcical performance by the Russian authorities had the single goal of creating the appearance of electoral legitimacy for Vladimir Putin, his policy of relentless domestic repression and, most of all, the war of aggression against Ukraine;\n\n3. Unequivocally condemns the illegal so-called election conducted in the territories of Ukraine that Russia has temporarily occupied, namely the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, the City of Sevastopol and parts of the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions; stresses that holding an election in these territories constitutes a clear breach of Ukrainian sovereignty and a distinct violation of international law, in particular the UN Charter; deplores the use of the threat of violence by the Russian authorities, as people were forced to vote in the presence of armed Russian soldiers; reiterates that, as stated by the High Representative on behalf of the EU, the EU will not recognise the holding of this so-called election in the territories of Ukraine or its outcome; calls for EU restrictive measures against those involved in the organisation and execution of the illegal polls;\n\n4. Underlines that the refusal to allow independent international observation of the Russian presidential election, in accordance with Russia\u2019s international commitments as an OSCE participating state, points to an unprecedented degree of democratic backsliding and a critical lack of willingness to honour international commitments and respect established principles of cooperation within international institutions; stresses that the decision of the Russian authorities not to invite the OSCE/ODIHR election observation mission to observe the election shows that they want to deny voters an impartial and independent assessment of the election;\n\n5. Urges the Member States of the European Union and the international community not to recognise the outcome of the Russian presidential election as legitimate, as it was held in the illegally occupied territories of Ukraine, and, even within Russia, was neither free nor fair, did not meet the basic international electoral standards, and thus lacked democratic legitimacy, and urges to limit relations with Putin to matters necessary for regional peace as well as humanitarian and human rights purposes, for example prisoner exchanges, the return of deported children to Ukraine or calling on the release of political prisoners;\n\n6. Salutes the bravery of the thousands of people in Russia who are protesting against Putin\u2019s regime and seeking to transform their country into a democracy, including by acts of resistance during the so-called election, such as the protests that crowded polling places in Russia and abroad at noon on Sunday 17 March 2024;\n\n7. Reiterates that the Kremlin regime and Vladimir Putin personally bear criminal and political responsibility for the death of their most prominent opponent, Alexei Navalny; calls for an international investigation into the circumstances surrounding his death, with the aim of holding those responsible to account;\n\n8. Continues to call for the immediate and unconditional release and compensation of all political prisoners, including Vladimir Kara-Murza, Oleg Orlov, Alexei Gorinov, Alexandra Skochilenko, Dmitry Ivanov, Ioann Kurmoyarov, Viktoria Petrova, Maria Ponomarenko, Dmitry Talantov, Yuri Dmitriev, Lilia Chanysheva, Ksenia Fadeeva, Ivan Safronov and Ilya Yashin, unjustly imprisoned journalists, including Alsu Kurmasheva and Evan Gershkovich, and their families, for the restoration of freedom of expression and association in Russia and for increased international scrutiny and monitoring of human rights abuses in Russia;\n\n9. Urges the Russian authorities to provide immediate access to comprehensive medical care for political prisoners whose health is in critical condition, most notably Vladimir Kara-Murza; reminds Russia to adhere to its international obligations on the rights of prisoners;\n\n10. Calls on the Russian authorities to grant consular officials access to prisoners with dual citizenship;\n\n11. Reiterates that the EU should stand in full solidarity with Russian civil society that has subscribed to universal democratic values and rejected imperialism, and should make use of the European human rights violations sanctions regime to sanction perpetrators of human rights violations; denounces the escalation of human rights violations by the Kremlin regime and condemns the ongoing crackdown on government critics, human rights defenders, anti-war activists and independent journalists, as well as the increased suppression of LGBTIQ activists;\n\n12. Calls for the EU and its Member States to work with international partners and organisations to provide support to political prisoners, in particular medical and legal assistance, which is being limited or denied to them, and to seek ways to secure their release; reiterates its call for the diplomatic representations of the EU and its Member States to continue to closely monitor court proceedings against members of the Russian political opposition and the conditions in which they are being held in prison; calls for the EU and its Member States to continue to raise awareness about the deteriorating human rights situation in Russia and to pressure the Russian Government to uphold its international obligations;\n\n13. Calls for the EU and its Member States to continue to actively support independent Russian civil society organisations, independent media outlets and human rights defenders; calls for the EU and its Member States to actively engage with and offer support to the Russian democratic opposition who oppose Russia\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine;\n\n14. Urges the Member States to provide humanitarian visas and other support to Russian dissidents, including lawyers, who are at risk of political persecution; reiterates its call for an EU-wide multi-entry visa scheme for human rights defenders and politically persecuted individuals and for the existing flexibility to be used to address gaps in legislation, as proposed by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights in its 2023 report entitled \u2018Protecting Human Rights Defenders at Risk: EU entry, stay and support\u2019; stresses, in this regard, that such schemes may also extend to opposition leaders, civil society activists and otherwise politically persecuted persons;\n\n15. Urges the EU institutions and the Member States to prepare for a situation in which Russia, like Belarus, ceases issuing passports in its consulates, in which case it may be necessary for the EU and all its Member States to recognise de facto statelessness and issue travel documents, as provided for in Article 28 of the UN Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons;\n\n16. Calls for the simplification of processes for Russian dissidents in the EU to register organisations and entities, open bank accounts and carry out other administrative tasks in order to allow them to continue their work in exile;\n\n17. Deplores the fact that the Prime Minister of Hungary, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, chose to break ranks with the EU and congratulate Vladimir Putin on his sham re-election;\n\n18. Expresses support for the work of the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Russian Federation, Mariana Katzarova, and calls on the Member States to ensure that the UN Human Rights Council extends her mandate again in 2024;\n\n19. Reiterates its unwavering solidarity with the people of Ukraine and its support for the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, within its internationally recognised borders; reiterates, therefore, its strong condemnation of Russia\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine and demands that Russia and its proxy forces terminate all military actions, cease attacks against residential areas and civilian infrastructure, withdraw all military forces from the entire internationally recognised territory of Ukraine, end forced deportations of Ukrainian civilians, release all detained Ukrainians, particularly children, and permanently cease violating or threatening the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine;\n\n20. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the Vice-President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the governments and parliaments of the Member States, the Council of Europe, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, and the Russian authorities.",

        "text": "US Supreme Court to decide if Trump has immunity in election interference case\nUS Supreme Court to decide if Trump has immunity in election interference case\n\nReuters Former US President Donald Trump and Special Counsel Jack Smith\n\nA historic case, one that could affect both Donald Trump's legal and political fates and define the scope of presidential power, lands before the nine justices of the US Supreme Court on Thursday. Lawyers for Mr Trump and Special Counsel Jack Smith will square off in a hearing on whether former presidents have immunity from criminal prosecution for actions they take while in office. Mr Smith charged the former president last year with allegedly attempting to overturn the results of the 2020 election. But Mr Trump said he could not be indicted under the US Constitution. The trial has been on hold while the dispute made its way up to the top court in the country. The case is already historic - Mr Trump is the first former president to have been charged with federal crimes. And the Supreme Court decision, which may not come until June, will be historic as well.\n\nIf the court rules Mr Trump can be prosecuted, then the trial will move forward, but will probably restart in late summer at the earliest, in the heart of the presidential election season. If it decides that he does have immunity, Mr Trump may see other criminal cases against him thrown out. Mr Smith had pressed the court to make a decision in December, but it declined. \"Richard Nixon famously said that the American people deserve to know whether their president is a crook,\" said Kermit Roosevelt, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania. \"The Supreme Court doesn't seem to agree. They're fine with preventing this from being decided before the election.\"\n\nWhat Donald Trump's lawyers could argue\n\nMr Trump's case hinges in large part on a 1982 court decision involving another Republican White House occupant, Mr Nixon, that presidents are immune from civil liability - lawsuits brought by private citizens - for actions taken as part of their official duties. Mr Trump's lawyers contend that the principles behind that decision also apply to criminal liability. \"The president should be able to do his job without fearing that justice system is going to be used to harass or retaliate against them,\" said Prof Roosevelt, who worked as a clerk for former Supreme Court Justice David Souter. Complicating matters is the part of the US Constitution that says leaders who are removed from office through a Senate impeachment trial are still \"liable and subject to indictment, trial, judgment and punishment, according to law\". Mr Trump's lawyers argue it means that former presidents can only be criminally tried after they've been impeached and found guilty by the US Senate. Mr Trump was found not guilty after his February 2021 impeachment trial for inciting the 6 January attack on the capitol.\n\nGetty Images Agents raided Mr Trump's Florida home in 2022 looking for classified documents\n\nMr Trump is also taking an \"absolute\" position on presidential immunity, said Georgetown University Law Professor David Super. His lawyers have asserted that opening former presidents to criminal prosecution would have serious consequences for the separation of power between the executive and judicial branches of government and the office of the presidency. This may be because the former president's actions - attempting to reverse election results to remain in power - appear strongly to be in his own self-interest, said Prof Super. The Supreme Court justices may not see them as part of his official duties. \"He's really taken an all or nothing stand here,\" he said. \"That may not be foolish, but it certainly is risky.\"\n\nHow Jack Smith's team may respond\n\nThe special counsel's office is also warning of extreme consequences, saying that if presidents are fully immune from criminal prosecution while in office, they can freely violate any law. During oral arguments at a lower court, one judge mused that under Mr Trump's reasoning, a president could order a special forces squad to kill a political opponent and not be charged. Mr Trump's assertion that former presidents are protected as long as they aren't convicted in an impeachment trial also opens a loophole, the prosecutors say. Presidents could commit crimes late in their term or resign prior to Senate conviction and evade prosecution. \"No person is above the law - including the president,\" Mr Smith wrote in a Supreme Court brief laying out the arguments he will present on Thursday. While there are no past examples of a former president being prosecuted, Mr Smith also points to Mr Nixon. He says the pardoning of Mr Nixon for the Watergate cover-up after he left office is proof that past presidents were aware that they were open to criminal charges.\n\nSome Supreme Court scenarios...\n\nThe justices - three of whom were appointed by Mr Trump - could rule former presidents have blanket immunity or hold they do not have any criminal immunity. The court could also issue a decision somewhere in the middle. For example, it could outline requirements for juries to consider, such as whether a former president was carrying out official duties. Or it could rule Mr Trump may have some level of immunity but leave it to a lower court to make that determination before trial. \"I think that, politically, that will be a very attractive option,\" said Mr Super. \"I don't think that they would like to be solely responsible for ending these prosecutions.\" Such an outcome would leave Mr Smith's prosecution in limbo, however, opening the door to further challenges and delays.\n\nMore on the US election\n\nIn such a politically charged case, the justices may try to issue a unanimous decision, Mr Roosevelt said, as they did in another case involving Mr Trump and Colorado's primary ballot. That would probably be a measured ruling that does not give Mr Trump blanket protection but leaves some opening for presidential immunity, he said. But the court could also fracture along its ideological fault lines. Mr Super envisioned an outcome where the three most conservative justices endorse sweeping immunity, the three most liberal give Mr Trump no protection and the remaining three come down somewhere in between. Then, the holding of those middle justices would carry the day - and also create a muddle for lower courts.\n\nThese are the far-reaching implications",

During the half century that followed, successive U.S. administrations pursued policies intended to isolate the island country economically and diplomatically. The United States has sanctioned Cuba longer than it has any other country.\n\nPresident Barack Obama took some extraordinary steps to normalize U.S. relations with Cuba, meeting with leader Ra\u00fal Castro and restoring full diplomatic ties. However, President Donald Trump largely reversed course, hitting Cuba with a raft of new sanctions and redesignating it as a state sponsor of terrorism. The Joe Biden administration has eased some restrictions, but renewed anti-regime protests in Cuba, combined with the country\u2019s worsening humanitarian situation and a massive wave of emigration to the United States, have further complicated the policy challenge.\n\nWhat triggered the falling out between Washington and Havana?\n\nThe tumultuous U.S.-Cuba relationship has its roots in the Cold War. In 1959, Fidel Castro and a group of revolutionaries seized power in Havana, overthrowing the U.S.-backed government of Fulgencio Batista. After the Cuban Revolution, the United States recognized Fidel Castro\u2019s government but began imposing economic penalties as the new regime increased its trade with the Soviet Union, nationalized American-owned properties, and hiked taxes on U.S. imports. After slashing Cuban sugar imports, Washington instituted a ban on nearly all U.S. exports to Cuba, which President John F. Kennedy expanded into a full economic embargo that included stringent travel restrictions.\n\nWhat was the Cuban Missile Crisis?\n\nThe United States severed diplomatic ties with Cuba and began pursuing covert operations to overthrow the Fidel Castro regime in 1961. The missile crisis arose after Cuba allowed the Soviet Union to secretly install nuclear missiles on the island following a botched CIA attempt to topple Castro, known as the Bay of Pigs invasion. U.S. surveillance aircraft uncovered the Soviet installations in October 1962, setting off a thirteen-day showdown between Kennedy and Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev that threatened to escalate into nuclear war.\n\nKennedy demanded that the Soviets remove the weapons and ordered the U.S. Navy to impose a maritime quarantine of Cuba to block additional arms from reaching the island. In the end, Khrushchev agreed to withdraw the missiles in exchange for a pledge from Kennedy not to invade Cuba and to remove U.S. nuclear missiles from Turkey. The crisis was a turning point in the Cold War, as the two superpowers made efforts to avoid nuclear confrontation.\n\nHow did relations evolve over the rest of the Cold War?\n\nIn the decades that followed, economic and diplomatic isolation became the major prongs of U.S. policy toward Cuba. In 1982, President Ronald Reagan labeled Cuba a state sponsor of terrorism [PDF] for its support of leftist militant groups in Africa and Central America. Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton signed laws\u2014the Cuba Democracy Act of 1992 and Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996, also known as the Helms-Burton Act\u2014that strengthened U.S. sanctions and stated that the embargo would remain in place until Cuba transitioned to a democracy that excludes the Castro family and upholds fundamental freedoms.\n\nSome adjustments in 1999 allowed for the export of U.S.-made medical supplies and food to the island. Restrictions tightened, however, under President George W. Bush, whose Commission for Assistance to a Free Cuba increased enforcement of existing sanctions.\n\nHow did U.S.-Cuba relations normalize?\n\nDuring his 2008 presidential campaign, Barack Obama said isolating Cuba had failed to advance U.S. interests and that it was time to pursue diplomacy with the Castro regime. Several weeks after taking office, he eased restrictions on remittances and travel, allowing Cuban Americans to send unlimited money to Cuba and permitting U.S. citizens to visit Cuba for religious and educational purposes.\n\nAs Obama began softening U.S. policy toward Cuba, the island signaled an openness to reform under the new leadership of Fidel\u2019s brother, Ra\u00fal. Facing an aging population, a heavy foreign debt load, and economic hardship amid the global downturn, Ra\u00fal Castro began liberalizing Cuba\u2019s state-controlled economy in 2009. His reforms included decentralizing the agricultural sector, relaxing restrictions on small businesses, opening up real estate markets, allowing Cubans to travel abroad more freely, and expanding access to consumer goods. Cuba\u2019s private sector swelled as a result, and the number of self-employed workers nearly tripled between 2009 and 2013.\n\nObama and Ra\u00fal Castro surprised the world in late 2014 by announcing that their governments would restore full diplomatic ties and begin to ease more than fifty years of bilateral tensions. The historic moment marked the culmination of eighteen months of secret diplomacy brokered by Pope Francis, during which the parties agreed to an exchange of prisoners, including Cuban intelligence officers and an American contractor, among other concessions.\n\nDaily News Brief A summary of global news developments with CFR analysis delivered to your inbox each morning.

The Obama administration further loosened restrictions on remittances and travel, as well as on trade, telecommunications, and financial services. It also removed Cuba\u2019s designation as a terrorism sponsor, a major obstacle to normalization. The two governments reopened their embassies\u2014a move that was met with widespread public support in both countries\u2014and negotiated a spate of bilateral agreements [PDF].\n\nIn early 2016, Obama took another significant step toward normalization, visiting Havana in what was the first trip to Cuba by a sitting U.S. president since Calvin Coolidge in 1928. In a keynote address broadcast live, with Ra\u00fal Castro sitting in the audience, Obama urged both countries to press on with reforms. The Cuban government should continue political and economic liberalization, and the U.S. Congress should lift the trade embargo, he said. Later that year, U.S. commercial airlines began offering service between the countries for the first time in more than fifty years.\n\nDays before leaving office in January 2017, Obama repealed the Clinton-era \u201cwet-foot, dry-foot policy\u201d [PDF], which allowed Cubans who came to the United States illegally to pursue permanent residency. The move, which the Cuban government welcomed, brought the U.S. government\u2019s treatment of Cubans in line with its handling of other unauthorized immigrants.\n\nWhat policy changes did President Trump make?\n\nThe death of Fidel Castro and the election of Donald Trump in 2016 rekindled debates over U.S.-Cuba policy. While in office, Trump followed through on campaign pledges to reverse course on much of the Obama administration\u2019s thaw with Cuba.\n\nIn 2017, the Trump administration prohibited commerce with businesses controlled by or operating on behalf of the Cuban military, intelligence agencies, and security services. It also banned Americans from traveling to Cuba individually for educational and cultural exchanges. Months later, the administration said it would pull most of its embassy staff from Havana after American and Canadian diplomatic workers suffered unexplained injuries, including hearing loss and cognitive impairment, which later became known as \u201cHavana Syndrome.\u201d Many of the U.S. embassy\u2019s functions, including the processing of most visas, were suspended. The Cuban government denied involvement in the mysterious attacks and urged the United States not to cut diplomatic ties. (The U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine found that directed, pulsed radio-frequency energy was the most plausible explanation for the injuries among those it considered.)\n\nWashington turned up its pressure on Havana in 2019, when it began allowing U.S. nationals to sue entities that traffic in or benefit from property confiscated by the Cuban regime. Congress provided for this in the Helms-Burton Act, but past U.S. presidents had routinely waived the provision. Canada and the European Union, both major foreign investors in Cuba, condemned the move as a violation of international law and pledged to protect their companies by fighting the decision through the World Trade Organization.\n\nIn addition to ending almost all individual travel to the island, Trump banned group educational exchanges in 2019. His administration prohibited cruise ships and other vessels from sailing between the United States and Cuba, banned U.S. flights to Cuban cities other than Havana, suspended private charter flights to Havana, and barred U.S. travelers from staying at hundreds of establishments linked to the Cuban government or Communist Party. (Americans have long sidestepped travel restrictions by flying to Cuba through other countries, including Mexico.) Administration officials framed the travel bans as an effort to keep tourism dollars out of Cuban government coffers. The White House further targeted Cuba\u2019s finances by curbing remittances and imposing economic sanctions. In 2018, the United Nations estimated that U.S. trade restrictions had cost Cuba more than $130 billion since the embargo began. That same year, Ra\u00fal Castro\u2019s hand-picked successor, Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel, took office as president.\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration grew increasingly wary of Cuba\u2019s close ties with the embattled socialist regime in Venezuela. In 2018, National Security Advisor John Bolton characterized Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela as a \u201ctroika of tyranny,\u201d blaming their governments for massive human suffering and regional instability. The Trump administration sought to staunch the flow of oil from Venezuela to Cuba by sanctioning shipping firms and Cuba\u2019s state oil company. It also banned Cuban officials from entering the United States for their alleged complicity in Venezuela\u2019s human rights abuses and, as one of Trump\u2019s final acts, redesignated Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism, reversing the Obama administration\u2019s 2015 determination.\n\nWhere does the Biden administration stand on Cuba?\n\nAs a candidate, Joe Biden pledged to reverse Trump\u2019s policies on Cuba, which he said did not advance human rights and democracy. After taking office, the Biden administration said it hoped to eventually lift remittance restrictions and enable Americans to travel to Cuba, and it began a review of other Trump administration actions. It also appointed a high-level official to oversee the State Department\u2019s response to the unexplained injuries U.S. diplomats sustained in Cuba. (U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in 2023 that the injuries were not likely to be caused by a foreign adversary, though some politicians are calling for a renewed assessment.) At the same time, Havana made some economic reforms, including easing restrictions on private businesses and unifying its dual currencies. It also expressed openness to Cuban American investors. In April 2021, D\u00edaz-Canel replaced Ra\u00fal Castro as the first secretary of the Communist Party, ending decades of leadership by the Castro family.\n\nHowever, the prospects for rapprochement faced new hurdles following the July 2021 outbreak of nationwide protests, Cuba\u2019s largest in nearly three decades. Demonstrators said they were reacting to worsening economic conditions, including power outages, shortages of food and medicine, and spiking inflation. Analysts attributed these woes to a combination of U.S. restrictions, government mismanagement, and a nearly 90 percent drop in foreign currency due to a pandemic-related collapse in tourism. Cuba\u2019s leaders responded by blaming foreign provocateurs, arresting protest organizers, and clamping down on internet and social media access across the island.\n\nBiden called on the regime to respect Cubans\u2019 rights to protest and \u201cfreely determine their own future,\u201d and his administration imposed new sanctions on several Cuban officials, including high-level members of the national police. In Congress, many Democrats argued that Washington should help ameliorate Cuba\u2019s humanitarian crisis, while some influential policymakers, including Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), pressed Biden [PDF] to expand Trump-era sanctions, bolster the island\u2019s internet access, and warn Havana against encouraging mass migration to the United States. In May 2022, following its Cuba policy review, the White House announced a series of measures to ease restrictions on the island, including expanding U.S. flights into the country, reestablishing a family reunification program, and lifting the remittance cap for families. Some critics, including Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chair Bob Menendez (D-NJ), have argued that the new measures will not help foster democracy, but rather bolster the communist government.\n\nConditions on the island continue to deteriorate. In March 2024, hundreds of demonstrators took to the streets to decry mass power outages and food shortages. Unlike with the 2021 demonstrations, the government responded to this unrest by ramping up electricity generation and distributing subsidized food rations, some of which China supplied. Havana also reiterated its accusations that Washington was stoking public dissent with the aim of overthrowing the communist-run government, which the White House denied.\n\nMeanwhile, Cuba\u2019s increasingly bleak economic situation has resulted in what experts say is the island\u2019s largest wave of emigration in modern history. Since fiscal year 2021, U.S. border officials have encountered nearly five hundred thousand Cubans at the southern U.S. border. In an effort to manage irregular migration, the Biden administration announced in January 2023 that up to thirty thousand Cubans would be eligible for entry into the country each month as part of a humanitarian parole program; the program also applies to migrants from Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. However, that April, the administration restarted deportation flights to Cuba after a two-year pause.",

        "text": "Poll Vaulting: Cyber Threats to Global Elections\nExecutive Summary\n\nThe election cybersecurity landscape globally is characterized by a diversity of targets, tactics, and threats. Elections attract threat activity from a variety of threat actors including: state-sponsored actors, cyber criminals, hacktivists, insiders, and information operations as-a-service entities. Mandiant assesses with high confidence that state-sponsored actors pose the most serious cybersecurity risk to elections.\n\nOperations targeting election-related infrastructure can combine cyber intrusion activity, disruptive and destructive capabilities, and information operations, which include elements of public-facing advertisement and amplification of threat activity claims. Successful targeting does not automatically translate to high impact. Many threat actors have struggled to influence or achieve significant effects, despite their best efforts.\n\nWhen we look across the globe we find that the attack surface of an election involves a wide variety of entities beyond voting machines and voter registries. In fact, our observations of past cycles indicate that cyber operations target the major players involved in campaigning, political parties, news and social media more frequently than actual election infrastructure.\n\nSecuring elections requires a comprehensive understanding of many types of threats and tactics, from distributed denial of service (DDoS) to data theft to deepfakes, that are likely to impact elections in 2024. It is vital to understand the variety of relevant threat vectors and how they relate, and to ensure mitigation strategies are in place to address the full scope of potential activity.\n\nElection organizations should consider steps to harden infrastructure against common attacks, and utilize account security tools such as Google\u2019s Advanced Protection Program to protect high-risk accounts.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe 2024 global election cybersecurity landscape is characterized by a diversity of targets, tactics, and threats. An expansive ecosystem of systems, administrators, campaign infrastructure, and public communications venues must be secured against a diverse array of operators and methods. Any election cybersecurity strategy should begin with a survey of the threat landscape to build a more proactive and tailored security posture.\n\nThe cybersecurity community must keep pace as more than two billion voters are expected to head to the polls in 2024. With elections in more than an estimated 50 countries, there is an opportunity to dynamically track how threats to democracy evolve. Understanding how threats are targeting one country will enable us to better anticipate and prepare for upcoming elections globally. At the same time, we must also appreciate the unique context of different countries. Election threats to South Africa, India, and the United States will inevitably differ in some regard. In either case, there is an opportunity for us to prepare with the advantage of intelligence.\n\nThe variety of threat actors and intentions exposes election-related targets to a range of cyber threat vectors. In addition to tactics that Mandiant commonly associates with cyber intrusion activity, such as phishing, exploitation of internet-exposed systems, and data theft, election cyber threat activity also seeks to influence public perceptions and voter choices. The tactics to accomplish this public-facing objective often leverage disruptive tactics. This includes web defacements, DDoS attacks, as well as publicizing intrusions and stolen data via leak sites or social media campaigns. Foreign state aligned information operations disseminate content on websites and social media. This is often intended to mislead target populations or encourage social divisions and mistrust in leaders and institutions.\n\nDespite the variety of cybersecurity challenges facing election ecosystems, it is important for the security community to remain level-headed. Information operations and disruptive cyber campaigns thrive when their impacts are built up. This makes objective and data-driven analysis essential. The variety of election cyber threat vectors presents complexity, but also highlights that direct election result interference attempts account for a small proportion of the overall threat landscape.\n\nDiversity of Targets: Protecting the Entire Election Ecosystem\n\nThe attack surface of an election involves a range of entities. This includes election systems and infrastructure, election administrators, entities involved in running the election, and organizations involved in political campaigning \u2014 including news and media organizations (Figure 1). The ease of targeting and nature of cyber threat activity (cyber espionage, information operations, extortion, etc.) can vary across entities within these categories.",

But Mr Trump said he could not be indicted under the US Constitution. The trial has been on hold while the dispute made its way up to the top court in the country.\n\nThe case is already historic - Mr Trump is the first former president to have been charged with federal crimes.\n\nAnd the Supreme Court decision, which may not come until June, will be historic as well.",

        "text": "America's billion-dollar bet on US chipmaking \u2013 DW \u2013 04/25/2024\nJoe Biden is desperate to bring advanced chipmaking to the country, and is willing to pay a lot for it. Using the CHIPS Act, the government is splurging billions to lure manufacturers. But can they compete with Taiwan?\n\nThe long US presidential election campaign is well underway, and Joe Biden can use all the good economic news he can get. The economy, or at least voters' perception of it, will have a lot to do with his chances for reelection.\n\nIn March, employers created more than 300,000 jobs and unemployment stood at 3.8%. At the same time, March's inflation rate rose a bit over February and it's anyone's guess when interest rates will come down.\n\nOne thing the president is convinced of is the importance of semiconductor chips \u2014 and making those chips in the US. In 2022, the government passed the CHIPS and Science Act and is now squeezing out every dollar it can to attract manufacturers, and that's adding up to be a lot of dollars.\n\nIs Taiwan's weakness America's advantage?\n\nToday, semiconductors power much of our modern life, from smartphones, vehicles and satellites to military equipment, data centers and generative artificial intelligence.\n\nThough semiconductor chips were invented in America, manufacturing has mostly moved elsewhere. Currently, most high-end semiconductor chips are made in Taiwan. Only about 10% of chips are made in the US, and none of the most advanced ones. Even superchips designed in the US by the likes of Nvidia, are made elsewhere.\n\nTaiwan, the semiconductor superpower To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nOne problem with this system is the vulnerability of global supply chains. Natural disasters, pandemics and human factors like embargoes and armed conflicts have had an impact on supply chains, said Alan Rae, director of the NYS Centers of Excellence and Advanced Technology at the University at Buffalo in New York.\n\nThe reliance on Taiwan is especially fraught. Nearby China claims the island and many fear a possible military strike or invasion that would substantially disrupt the world's economy. Plus, the island recently suffered from its strongest earthquake in 25 years.\n\nRae, an expert on semiconductor manufacturing with decades of experience, is a keen industry watcher. \"Taiwan has done a superb job building a complete ecosystem for leading-edge chip production,\" he told DW. \"Duplicating this will take significant money and effort but is achievable.\"\n\nAmerica responds with CHIPS and Science Act\n\nTo diversify away from Taiwan and Southeast Asia, a number of countries like Germany are trying to attract chipmakers. But the US is more determined to onshore advanced chipmaking than most. The Biden administration sees this as a way to build up domestic jobs and overcome national security vulnerabilities.\n\nThe CHIPS and Science Act is its main tool. Here, \"chips\" stands for \"Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors.\" One provision of the law gives $39 billion (\u20ac36.6 billion) in federal grants to the Commerce Department to lure companies to build or expand US-based semiconductor manufacturing. It allocates another $75 billion for loans, among other measures.\n\nCommerce Secretary Gina Raimondo thinks the US is on track to produce 20% of world's leading-edge logic chips by 2030 Image: Jack Gruber/USA TODAY Network/Imago Images\n\nAt a podium discussion in February, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said semiconductors are the \"most important piece of hardware in the 21st century\" and that the US must cement its leadership role in this crucial industry.\n\nTo help make this happen, her department is using money from the CHIPS Act to make \"targeted investments in relentless pursuit of achieving our national security objectives,\" she said.\n\nImportantly, they are focusing on research and manufacturing clusters and projects that will be operational by 2030 to \"maximize our impact in this decade.\"\n\nBillions in grants are being handed out\n\nNow the money is starting to flow, with the first grants going to GlobalFoundries, Microchip Technology and BAE Systems.\n\nIn March, Biden announced a $8.5 billion grant for Silicon Valley-based Intel to help it build up chip production across four states. It was the biggest grant so far and comes with an additional $11 billion in loans.\n\nIn early April, another $6.6 billion in direct funding and $5 billion in loans was announced for Taiwan-based TSMC to build in Phoenix, Arizona. The company plans to invest more than $65 billion in three manufacturing facilities. The first site should be online 2025.\n\nA week later, the US government announced $6.4 billion for South Korea's Samsung to expand an existing facility plus build two new ones in Texas. The company, which has been manufacturing in America since 1996, also promised to set up a research and development operation in the state. In total, the company is expected to invest more than $40 billion.\n\nBuilding up an industry in an election year\n\nNext in line is Micron Technology, the biggest maker of memory chips in the US. Micron is set to receive up to $6.1 billion in grants from the US government to help build semiconductor plants in New York and Idaho, the White House said Thursday.\n\nThat will bring total federal grants to more than $33 billion and leave just over $6 billion to splash out on the industry. In addition to these direct grants and loans are billions in promised tax credits to cover a large part of building costs.\n\nConstruction and manufacturing should create tens of thousands of well-paid jobs. But big investments are only one side of the equation; workforce development is also important, and so is access to a supportive supplier ecosystem, said Rae.\n\nSupply chains have been optimized for economics but not flexibility says Alan Rae Image: AFP\n\nCreating jobs and bringing manufacturing back to the United States are a big part of Biden's economic policy. But investing billions in a single industry \u2014 no matter how important \u2014 may not woo enough voters.\n\nMoreover, voters' memories are short, said John Mark Hansen, a professor of political science at the University of Chicago in Illinois. Still, evidence shows that \"a strong economy benefits the party of the incumbent president and a poor economy hurts it.\"\n\nAnd looking at the economy, \"the best predictor of election outcomes is the growth in real disposable income per capita,\" Hansen told DW. In other words how much money people take home after inflation and taxes. There are still a few months before the election in November, \"but it doesn't look as bad for Biden as everybody seems to think.\"\n\nEdited by: Uwe Hessler",

Transferability is helping projects get built more quickly and affordably, which will create good-paying jobs and lower energy costs for families.\u00a0The Inflation Reduction Act created two new credit delivery mechanisms\u2014elective pay (otherwise known as \u201cdirect pay\u201d) and transferability\u2014that are enabling state, local, and Tribal governments; non-profit organizations; Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories; and many more businesses to take advantage of clean energy tax credits. Until the Inflation Reduction Act introduced these new credit delivery mechanisms, governments, many types of tax-exempt organizations, and many businesses could not fully benefit from tax credits like those that incentivize clean energy construction.\u00a0\u201cThe Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s new tools to access clean energy tax credits are a catalyst for meeting President Biden\u2019s historic economic and climate goals. They are acting as a force multiplier, enabling companies to realize far greater value from incentives to deploy new clean power and manufacture clean energy components,\u201d said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. \u201cMore clean energy projects are being built quickly and affordably, and more communities are benefitting from the growth of the clean energy economy.\u201d\u201cThanks to President Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act, more small businesses, startups, and other businesses can now benefit from game-changing clean energy tax credits by using the innovative transferability tool,\u201d said White House National Economic Advisor Lael Brainard. \u201cWe are already seeing businesses eager to participate in the transfer market, with more than 50,000 registration numbers requested for projects or facilities pursuing transferability. These final rules will provide additional clarity and certainty for clean energy investments in communities across the country.\u201dThe Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s transferability provisions allow businesses to transfer all or a portion of any of 11 clean energy credits to a third-party in exchange for tax-free immediate funds, so that businesses can take advantage of tax incentives if they do not have sufficient tax liability to fully utilize the credits themselves. Entities without sufficient tax liability were previously unable to realize the full value of credits, which raised costs and created challenges for financing projects.The Inflation Reduction Act also allows tax-exempt and governmental entities to receive elective payments for 12 clean energy tax credits, including the major Investment and Production Tax Credits, as well as tax credits for electric vehicles and charging stations. Businesses can also choose elective pay for a five-year period for three of those credits: the credits for Advanced Manufacturing (45X), Carbon Oxide Sequestration (45Q), and Clean Hydrogen (45V).\u00a0 Final rules on elective pay were issued in March.To facilitate taxpayers transferring a clean energy credit or receiving a direct payment of an energy credit or CHIPS credit, the IRS built IRS Energy Credits Online (ECO) for taxpayers to complete the pre-file registration process and receive a registration number. The registration number must be included on the taxpayer\u2019s annual return when making a transfer election or elective payment election for a clean energy credit. The registration process helps prevent improper payments to fraudulent actors and provides the IRS with basic information to ensure that any taxpayer that qualifies for these credit monetization mechanisms can readily access these benefits upon filing a return and making an election.As of April 19, more than 900 entities have requested approximately 59,000 registration numbers for projects or facilities located across all 50 states plus territories. Approximately 97% of these projects are pursuing transferability.\u00a0 A wide variety of credits are being used, but the bulk transferability-related registrations are related to solar and wind projects using the investment or production tax credit.\u00a0 In addition, more than 1,300 projects or facilities submitted are pursuing elective pay, including submissions from more than 75 state and local governments to register approximately 650 clean buses and vehicles through elective pay.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The value of the tax credits for these projects is not determined during the pre-filing registration process and is instead determined after an entity files their tax return.\u00a0\u00a0The number of registration number requests described above does not include cases where an entity has not yet formally requested a registration number, including those who may have work saved in progress in IRS ECO. Registration numbers, which speed return processing and help prevent improper payments, are being issued on a rolling basis.\u00a0 The IRS has already issued approximately 40,000 registration numbers.###",

And what are Biden\u2019s goals for a second term?\n\nA year on from that announcement and with the 2024 election campaign in full swing, the president has yet to lay out a formal agenda for 2025-29. That has frustrated many in his own party who believe that Biden, still struggling with low approval ratings, needs to communicate to voters how he plans to improve their lives if they grant him four more years in the White House.\n\nThe administration has briefed reporters on an expansive agenda, however. Priorities include abortion rights, gun control and lowering the cost of living.\n\n\u2022",

        "text": "Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies Home\nAward Winners of 2024 NP Research Grants!\n\nApril 2024\n\n\n\nThe Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies (CCPS), in collaboration with AU\u2019s Washington College of Law (WCL) and Purdue University\u2019s Center for Research on Diversity and Inclusion (CRDI), is proud to announce the winners of our 2024 New Perspectives in Studies of American Governance research grants. With support from Hewlett Foundation\u2019s U.S. Democracy program, we are supporting seven new projects that stand to transform political scientists\u2019 collective understanding of American governance and representation. This marks the second time we are awarding these grants, reaffirming our commitment to fostering innovative research that sheds new light on the intricacies of American governance.\n\n1. How Legislative Institutions Evolve: Member Identity, Experience, & Democratic Norms in U.S. Congressional Reforms\n\nProf Emily Baer, University of New Hampshire\n\nAbstract: This project examines how Congress evolves \u2013 or fails to evolve \u2013 to meet the needs and interests of new generations of lawmakers and leaders. Research suggests that members draw on a more limited set of influences in the contemporary era than in earlier historical periods, including partisanship and ideology. How does the increasing diversity of lawmaker identities and backgrounds shape institutional reform debates \u2013 and the power and role of leaders \u2013 in the U.S. Congress? This project leverages archival documents and interviews to identify influences on lawmakers\u2019 beliefs about the structure of institutions, how such influences have changed over time in response to broader political, cultural, social, and economic shifts, and how lawmakers\u2019 increasingly diverse backgrounds and experiences shape the structure of the legislative branch. It contributes to vital debates on the linkage between lawmaker identities and representation in Congress and will improve our understanding of how legislative institutions evolve in Congress.\n\n2. Representation in the U.S. Senate in the Digital Age: An Analysis of Rhetorical Representation\n\nProf. Stephanie Davis, University of Arkansas at Little Rock\n\nAbstract: Changes in the electorate, technology, communication styles and methods affect the way representatives build the electoral connection with their constituents. In particular, the introduction of Twitter/X has provided a low-cost way for representatives to bypass traditional media intermediaries to communicate directly with constituencies. This study expands on a comprehensive analysis of U.S. Senators' Twitter communication strategies, exploring the evolution of digital home styles and their impact on constituent relationships. Leveraging a novel dataset of 1,682,025 tweets from 165 senators (January 2008 to February 2023), the project\u2019s initial findings reveal that senators strategically deploy digital messaging that focuses on localized reputation-building and national policy advocacy to enhance electoral prospects. To continue studying the relationship between senators and their home constituency, we will conduct a systematic analysis of the tweet text, examining how senators\u2019 use localized language to build on their electoral connection with their constituents on a global digital platform.\n\n3. How Disparities in Candidate Wealth Matter for Diversity in Congress\n\nProf. Ryan Mundy, Prof. Savannah Plaskon, and Prof. Danielle Thomsen, University of California, Irvine\n\nAbstract: Congressional candidates are increasingly defined by their ability to raise vast sums of money. Yet far less attention has been given to the financial resources of candidates themselves. We examine how wealth disparities influence who runs, who wins, and how candidates pave their paths to Congress. We focus on two components of candidate warchests that are expected to be intricately tied to wealth: self-funding patterns and access to high-dollar, \u201cmax-out\u201d donors. One paper explores whether wealthy candidates receive more max-out contributions and how max-outs are related to electoral success. Another paper analyzes racial and gender disparities in self-finance and their connection to the personal assets of candidates. We draw on new data on candidate race, gender, and wealth as well as FEC data on the amount and timing of individual contributions and candidate loans. Our project sheds new light on self-finance and a small but critical segment of rich donors. The dramatic resource disparities across candidates have important implications for diversity and representation in Congress.\n\n4. The Federal Government\u2019s Role in High Rates of Felon Disenfranchisement Among Native Americans\n\nProf. Melissa Rogers, Claremont Graduate University, Prof. Joseph Dietrich, Towson University, and Prof. Jean Schroedel, Claremont Graduate University\n\nAbstract: Influential research argues that felon disenfranchisement laws had the intent and effect of denying the vote to African-Americans. This research, however, cannot explain the adoption and expansion of these laws in Western states with small Black populations. We document the increasing stringency of felon disenfranchisement laws in these states following the extension of Native American suffrage. While most research focuses on state actions in felon disenfranchisement, we argue that federal policies also substantially impact Native Americans. When Native Americans are arrested for felonies on most reservations, they are under federal jurisdiction. Federal courts impose longer sentences than most states for equivalent crimes, and felons are not eligible for parole, a key point when voting rights are restored in many states. Jurisdictional challenges, legal ambiguities, and concerns with voting violations strongly discourage Native felons from voting after completing their (longer) sentences. We use mixed methods to highlight the role of federal policies. Using McGirt v. Oklahoma as a \u201cnatural experiment\u201d in federal versus state jurisdiction, we show that federal felons are more often disenfranchised and for longer periods. We also conduct interviews in South Dakota and Nebraska to identify differences in voting outcomes between federal and state jurisdiction for Native Americans.\n\n5. A Crisis of Communication: Reporting on the Realities of Covering a Digital Congress\n\nProf. Annelise Russell, University of Kentucky\n\nAbstract: Social media tells the day-to-day story of Congress, but this research goes behind the digital curtain to understand the media relationships at the core of that communication. The rapid-response media environment tests the capacity of journalists to cover Congress, demanding real time updates in a digital-first environment. Journalists in Congress build relationships over social media or text message, a trend further reinforced by the global pandemic. Congressional reporters are asked to do more to meet the information exchange, not only producing content, but developing a digital brand for themselves. Journalists fuel and react to the narratives coming out of Congress, while adapting to a world where their power also comes from followers in addition to proximity. This project overs a multi-disciplinary approach, bridging communication, journalism, and political science, to consider the dynamics of the digital information exchange in Congress. This research offers an important and new perspective about how journalists influence the daily dialogue in Congress and what that means for how information is shared in a political, hybrid media system.\n\n6. Electability Politics: How and Why Black Americans Vote in Primary Elections\n\nProf. Jasmine Smith, George Washington University\n\nAbstract: How do Black Americans make political decisions in primary elections? How is this decision making unique compared to other groups? To answer this question, I test competing theories about descriptive representation, substantive representation, and strategic voting. I draw from literature in race, ethnicity, and politics that details Black Americans\u2019 party affiliation and preference for same race candidates. I also draw from literature that analyzes the role of voters in primary elections that concludes that voters use candidate ideology in primary elections, and that voters support candidates that can win the general election.\n\nI argue that for Black Americans the most important factor in electoral decision-making is how likely the candidate is to win the general election. I argue that due to Black Americans\u2019 unique historical political experience, Black Americans weigh electability as the most important criteria for vote choice in primary elections. Relying on their electability strategy, Black Americans forego their preferences for same race and same policy candidates and instead vote for candidates able to win the general election. I also argue that Black Americans exhibit unique behavior compared to other racial and ethnic groups in primary elections. I test these claims using a survey experiment.\n\n7.

        "text": "Election might decide fate of FTC noncompetes ban\nThe 2024 U.S. presidential election will be decisive for the Federal Trade Commission's ban on noncompete agreements, especially if legal challenges fail to block the rule's implementation.\n\nThe president appoints FTC commissioners. Depending on whether Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump or President Joe Biden, a Democrat, win the election, the five-member commission could flip position. The existing FTC is comprised of three Democrats and two Republicans. The latter voted against the final rule banning noncompete agreements passed by the FTC this week in a 3-2 vote. The rule is supposed to take effect 120 days after being published in the Federal Register.\n\nAt the beginning of the term, the Biden administration indicated the desire to regulate use of noncompete agreements in the labor market, tasking the FTC with taking action either through banning or limiting use of those agreements. However, the FTC's action to ban noncompetes met opposition from Republican FTC commissioners who argued that such rulemaking should be Congress' responsibility. Meanwhile, the FTC is also facing lawsuits from tax services provider Ryan LLC and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which similarly question the FTC's rulemaking authority.\n\n\"Let me be clear: My dissent today should not be interpreted to mean that I endorse all noncompete agreements,\" FTC Commissioner Melissa Holyoak said during an FTC webcast of the vote. \"To the contrary, I support the commission's prosecution of anticompetitive noncompete agreements where the facts and law support such enforcement. However, no matter how important, conspicuous and controversial the issue, an administrative agency's power to regulate in the public interest must always be grounded in a valid grant of authority from Congress.\"\n\nRobert Milligan, a business attorney at Seyfarth Shaw, said noncompete bans themselves aren't necessarily a Democrat vs. Republican issue. The Republican FTC commissioners' opposition wasn't based on the merits of the noncompetes ban itself but on the FTC's authority to pass such rules.\n\nIf the FTC's noncompetes ban isn't delayed or struck down by the courts, the presidential election could be a deciding factor in whether a noncompete ban comes from the FTC or through legislation proposed by Congress, Milligan said.",

        "text": "18 indicted in alleged 2020 fake Arizona elector scheme tied to Trump, AG announces\nAn Arizona grand jury indicted 18 people Wednesday in the ongoing investigation into an alleged attempt to use alternate electors after the 2020 presidential election as part of a wider alleged conspiracy to falsely declare then-President Donald Trump the winner, the state's attorney general announced. Former Trump adviser Rudy Giuliani and former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows are among those facing charges in the case.\n\nThe alleged fake electors and defendants named in the indictment were Kelli Ward, Tyler Bowyer, Nancy Cottle, Jacob Hoffman, Anthony Kern, James Lamon, Robert Montgomery, Samuel Moorhead, Lorraine Pellegrino, Gregory Safsten and Michael Ward, with several other defendants not named.\n\nWard was the Arizona Republican Party chair, and Hoffman and Kern are both Arizona state senators. Hoffman had in the past several weeks been pursuing a position with the Republican National Committee.\n\nThe defendants, according to the indictment, are accused of pressuring election officials to change the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. After the secretary of state, board of supervisors and GOP Gov. Doug Ducey certified that Joe Biden had won the election in Arizona over Trump, the defendants, who were the Republican presidential electors for Arizona, voted for Trump and then-Vice President Mike Pence. They were, the indictment says, \"falsely claiming to be the duly elected and qualified Electors for President and Vice President of the United States from the State of Arizona.\"\n\nIn a statement, Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes said the indictments were the results of a \"thorough\" 13-month investigation. \"I will not allow American democracy to be undermined,\" Mayes said. \"It is too important.\"\n\nAdditional defendants' names were redacted from court documents because they had not yet been served, Mayes said. Some, however, could be identified by their descriptions in court documents.\n\nThe indictment described Trump as \"Unindicted Coconspirator 1.\" Trump has repeatedly called such prosecutions \"witch hunts.\"\n\nOne of the unnamed defendants, referred to as \"an attorney for Unindicted Coconspirator 1 who was often identified as 'the Mayor'\" was confirmed to be Rudy Giuliani, who was later served an indictment. Jenna Ellis, another attorney who joined Giuliani in helping spread baseless claims of widespread voter fraud, also appears to be described in the documents.\n\nAnother unnamed defendant is referred to as Trump's chief of staff in 2020, which would have been Mark Meadows. Another unidentified defendant was the Trump campaign's Director of Election Day Operations, a title that belonged to Mike Roman.\n\nAttorney George Terwilliger, who represents Meadows, told The Associated Press that while he hadn't seen the indictment, naming Meadows would be \"a blatantly political and politicized accusation and will be contested and defeated.\"\n\nTed Goodman, a political adviser to Giuliani, told the AP the indictment shows \"the continued weaponization of our justice system.\"\n\nWhile Ellis did not directly publicly comment, she replied, \"It's been a great day to keep serving a faithful God\" on X when a user asked her, \"it wasn't the best of days for you was it?\"\n\nIn a statement on X, the Republican Party of Arizona called the indictments \"politically motivated\" and a \"blatant abuse of legal authority aimed to disrupt, distract, and interfere in the 2024 election.\"\n\nTrump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said in a statement that the case is a \"another example of Democrats' weaponization of the legal system.\"\n\nProsecutors are accusing the defendants of deceiving Arizonans \"by falsely claiming that those votes were contingent only on a legal challenge that would change the outcome of the election.\"\n\nHowever, the indictment says that in fact, the defendants intended to use their false votes to \"encourage (Vice President) Pence to reject the Biden-Harris votes on January 6, 2021, regardless of the outcome of the legal challenge.\" They allegedly hoped that when six other states with false GOP electors submitted their uncertified votes for Trump and Pence, that Pence would either declare Trump the winner, \"delay the proceeding and have individual state legislatures determine their electors, or have Congress resolve any claimed uncertainty about the validity of election results in Arizona and six other states\" in Trump's favor.\n\n\"The scheme failed,\" prosecutors said in the indictment, when Pence accepted all certified Biden-Harris votes on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nHoffman told the Arizona Republic in a statement that he is \"innocent of any crime,\" and \"I look forward to the day when I am vindicated of this naked political persecution by the judicial process.\"\n\nAn attorney for Lamon also told the Arizona Republic the indictment is \"a politically motivated prosecution.\"\n\nThe Arizona Republican Party called the indictments a \"blatant and unprecedented abuse of prosecutorial power\" and said it \"condemns these actions in the strongest terms.\"\n\nThe charges being brought include fraud, forgery, and conspiracy, which are class 2, 4, and 5 felonies, Mayes said.\n\nArizona is one of seven states that Trump lost in 2020 where the former president's allies allegedly attempted to create a fraudulent register of electors.\n\n\"Unwilling to accept\" the fact that Biden won the 2020 presidential election, the defendants \"schemed to prevent the lawful transfer of the presidency\" by raising false claims of election fraud and organizing fake elector votes, the indictment said.\n\nThe alleged fraud was committed to prevent \"the lawful transfer of the presidency of the United States,\" keeping \"Trump in office against the will of Arizona voters, and depriving Arizona voters of their right to vote and have their votes counted,\" court documents said.\n\nThe Arizona indictments came as Trump and 18 of his associates face charges of racketeering, election fraud and other charges in Fulton County, Georgia, over an alleged effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election, including the alternate elector scheme. That indictment alleged that some of the defendants solicited legislators to appoint new electors in other states besides Georgia, including Arizona.\n\nIn August of last year, the former president was indicted by a federal grand jury over alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. That indictment, stemming from special counsel Jack Smith's investigation into Trump's actions following the 2020 election, cited a memo outlining a strategy for Trump supporters to serve as fake electors.\n\nThe former president has denied all wrongdoing in both of those cases.\n\nKathryn Watson, Scott MacFarlane and Olivia Rinaldi contributed reporting.",

        "text": "Election 2024: Is Donald Trump an Isolationist?\nIs Donald Trump an isolationist?\n\nClaims abound that he is. A quick Google search turns up titles such as: \u201cTrump Is an Isolationist, Professor Says\u201d; \u201cMike Pence Warns Donald Trump Is Embracing Isolationism Over American Leadership\u201d; and \u201cDonald Trump and the New Isolationism.\u201d New York Times columnists state flatly that \u201che is an isolationist.\u201d And, of course, \u201cAmerica First\u201d was the slogan of choice more than eight decades ago of those who wanted the United States to stay out of the war in Europe.\n\nOf course, whether Trump is an isolationist or not depends on what one means by the term. If \u201cisolationism\u201d simply means being skeptical of how U.S. foreign policy has been practiced for the past eight decades and doubtful of the benefits to the United States of exercising global leadership, then Trump qualifies as an isolationist. Since taking out a full-page ad in the Boston Globe, the New York Times, and the Washington Post in September 1987, attacking Japan, Saudi Arabia, and other countries \u201cfor taking advantage of the United States,\u201d he has been arguing that America\u2019s friends and allies have been getting Washington to sacrifice America\u2019s blood and treasure \u201cto protect their interests.\u201d\n\nThe Water's Edge James M.

As Charles Kupchan writes in his deeply researched and thoughtful book Isolationism: A History of America\u2019s Efforts to Shield Itself from the World: isolationism is \u201ca grand strategy aimed at disengagement with foreign power and the avoidance of enduring strategic commitments beyond the North America homeland.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s here that Trump departs from true isolationists like Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky. Trump has always been less concerned about whether America is engaged in the world and more concerned about what it is getting from that engagement. Trump\u2019s many complaints about NATO and the U.S.-South Korea alliance, for instance, aren\u2019t based on the fear that they entangle the United States in the geopolitical affairs of other countries. His complaints are instead that those allies haven\u2019t paid enough for the privilege of U.S. protection. His mantra seemingly has been, \u201cif you pay, we stay.\u201d Likewise, the national security strategy issued during Trump\u2019s presidency hardly read like a call to \u201cCome home, America.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s love for tariffs also doesn\u2019t make him an isolationist. Throughout the nineteenth century, when George Washington\u2019s \u201cgreat rule of conduct\u201d to \u201csteer clear of permanent alliances\u201d was the bedrock principle of U.S. foreign policy, tariff policy sparked bitter political fights. There the fault lines ran between states with substantial manufacturing interests, which saw tariffs as good for business, and states that depended more on agriculture, which didn\u2019t.\n\nTrump is better described as a protectionist, a nationalist, and above all, a transactionalist. The distinction is not merely an academic one. It points to the fact that a Trump return to the White House next January doesn\u2019t mean an inevitable U.S. retreat from the world. The choices he makes will depend in large part on whether America\u2019s friends and allies make good on their promises to do more and create space for him to trumpet his deal-making skills. U.S. leadership may be in less supply under a second Trump presidency, but U.S. presence abroad could well continue.\n\nCampaign Update\n\nJoe Biden made news in a live interview today with radio host Howard Stern. The president said he would be \u201chappy to debate\u201d Trump. Biden didn\u2019t say how many debates he would agree to. At a break during his trial in Manhattan, Trump responded on Truth Social:\n\nThe results of Tuesday\u2019s Republican presidential primary in Pennsylvania returned the spotlight to a potential Trump weakness. He won the race overwhelmingly, picking up 84 percent of the vote. However, nearly 17 percent of Pennsylvania Republicans who went to the polls on Tuesday voted for Nikki Haley, who dropped out of the race last month. The biggest anti-Trump votes were in the Pennsylvania suburbs. The results in Pennsylvania were similar to those in other battleground states like Georgia and Wisconsin.\n\nThe Candidates in Their Own Words\n\nBiden signed into law on Wednesday the bill that provides $95.3 billion in aid to Israel, Taiwan, and Ukraine. He hailed the aid package because \u201cit\u2019s going to make America safer. It\u2019s going to make the world safer. And it continues America\u2019s leadership in the world, and everyone knows it.\u201d\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Biden Video Pause Video Pause Biden Embed\n\nYesterday, Biden went to Syracuse, New York, to announce that the U.S. government will provide Micron Technology with $6.1 billion in subsidies to build semiconductor \u201cfabs\u201d in New York and Idaho. Biden argued that government support is \u201cbringing advanced chips manufacturing back to America after 40 years. And it\u2019s going to transform our semiconductor industry, a pillar of a modern economy. And it\u2019s going to create an entirely new ecosystem in research, design, manufacturing of advanced chips here in America.\u201d\n\nThe Chris Stigall Podcast released an interview with Trump on Monday. Asked about the House\u2019s passage of the Ukraine aid bill on Saturday without any provisions for border security, Trump said he would \u201cstraighten out the border. I don\u2019t need anything from Congress.\u201d As for the situation in Ukraine, the former president said that \u201cnobody can understand it\u201d and that \u201cBiden\u2019s words to Putin, those words were essentially, if you know anything about psychology or anything else, those words were leading him to go in.\u201d However, Trump didn\u2019t criticize the decision to send aid to Ukraine or claim credit for forcing changes in the aid package. He instead argued that \u201cyou just can't leave, you just can't let that whole thing happen. It would be a slaughter, and we'll have to see what happens.\u201d\n\nTrump also declined to criticize aid for Ukraine in an interview on Real America\u2019s Voice. He instead defended Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, who cooperated with Democrats to move the bill to the House floor. Trump praised Johnson for turning some of the aid to Ukraine into a loan\u2014though a loan that the United States can forgive\u2014and being \u201cvery strong with me\u201d in calling on NATO members to spend more on defense.\n\nBiden told a story at a campaign rally that triggered a diplomatic tiff. He said that his uncle was killed during World War II after his plane was shot down over \u201can area where there were a lot of cannibals in New Guinea at the time.\u201d Papua New Guinea\u2019s prime minister, James Marape, responded with a statement that \u201cPresident Biden\u2019s remarks may have been a slip of the tongue; however, my country does not deserve to be labeled as such.\u201d Marape further suggested that \u201cit is time for the USA to find as many remains of World War II in PNG as possible, including those of servicemen who lost their lives like\u201d Biden\u2019s uncle. Trump jumped on Biden for his \u201ccannibals\u201d comment, saying that \u201ceverything\u2019s a lie with this guy\u201d and that \u201che\u2019s a strange guy, he\u2019s demented in many ways.\u201d\n\nCornel West gave an interview to the Washington Post on Monday. He argued that \u201cthe crisis in the Republican Party, the undercutting and the neofascism of Trump on the one hand, and now the Democratic establishment especially around Gaza\u201d requires him to stay in the race.\n\nWhat the Pundits Are Saying\n\nThe New York Times detailed how Robert F. Kennedy Jr. secured a spot on the Michigan ballot in November. Kennedy will be running as a candidate of the Natural Law Party, \u201cFor 22 years, [Doug] Dern, a bankruptcy lawyer with a small practice outside Detroit, has almost single-handedly kept the Natural Law Party on Michigan\u2019s ballot.\u201d Dern has done so out of a belief that \u201csomeday, a candidate is going to come along who\u2019s going to be perfect for it. Someday, the third parties are going to be hot.\u201d Being named the Natural Party\u2019s candidate saved the Kennedy campaign a lot of work. Michigan state law requires \u201cindependent candidates without any party backing\u201d to gather \u201cbetween 12,000 and 60,000 signatures, including 100 signatures from each of at least half of the state\u2019s congressional districts.\u201d All Kennedy needed to make the Natural Law Party\u2019s ballot was the consent of Dern, the party chair, and the party\u2019s secretary.\n\nPolitico\u2019s Alex Ward and Daniel Lippman examined the jockeying in Republicans circles for senior national security positions in a potential second Trump administration. \u201cAmong the names are Richard Grenell, a former ambassador to Germany whom Trump has called his \u201cenvoy\u201d to the world and is known for fiercely fighting with the media; Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), a former ambassador to Japan who is comfortable in Trump world and traditional Republican circles; Elbridge Colby, the former senior Pentagon official pushing American officials to invest more in countering China; and Robert O\u2019Brien, Trump\u2019s fourth national security adviser and a self-described Reagan Republican.\u201d\n\nA team of Reuters reporters examined the steps that U.S. allies are taking to ingratiate themselves with Trump and other Republicans in the event that the forty-fifth president returns to the White House. \u201cGermany is waging a charm offensive inside the Republican Party. Japan is lining up its own Trump whisperer. Mexican government officials are talking to Camp Trump. And Australia is busy making laws to help Trump-proof its U.S. defense ties.\u201d\n\nWhat the Polls Show\n\nGallup released its Rating World Leaders report on Tuesday. Gallup polled people in one hundred thirty countries in 2023 about their views of a range of global powers. The median global approval rating of the United States was 41 percent, the same as in 2022 but down four percentage points from 2021, the first year of Biden\u2019s presidency. The median rating for the United States during Trump\u2019s presidency ranged from 30 to 33 percent.\n\nAn Axios Vibes survey conducted by the Harris Poll found that 51 percent of Americans support mass deportation of undocumented immigrants. In terms of party identification, support for mass deportations was highest among Republicans, with 68 percent expressing approval. But 42 percent of Democrats did as well. There was also substantial support for mass deportations across racial and ethnic lines, with 56 percent of Whites, 45 percent of Latinos, and 40 Blacks expressing support. Trump has vowed to conduct \u201cthe largest domestic deportation operation in American history.\u201d\n\nThe Campaign Schedule\n\nThe Republican National Convention opens in Milwaukee in eighty days (July 15, 2024).\n\nThe Democratic National Convention opens in Chicago in 115 days (August 19, 2024).\n\nElection Day is 193 days away.\n\nInauguration Day is 269 days away.\n\nSinet Adous assisted in the preparation of this post.",

        "text": "Democrats are worried. But will RFK Jr take more votes away from Trump?\nDemocrats are worried. But will RFK Jr take more votes away from Trump?\n\nBBC Robert F Kennedy Jr, an independent presidential candidate, says he's drawing support from across the political spectrum\n\nMike Panza showed up early to a comedy benefit to support the Kennedy campaign for president.\n\nWearing a Star Wars-themed shirt and queuing outside the Royal Oak Theatre in this Detroit suburb, he talked about what drew him to the one candidate in the 2024 race identifiable solely by his initials - RFK Jr.\n\n\"I'd like a return to the middle of the road,\" said Mr Panza, 44. \"His stance on health care is really appealing. Kennedy wants to make people healthy, he wants to make the country healthy.\"\n\nMr Panza, who works as an environmental officer, might sound like a disaffected Democrat. But when I ask who he voted for in 2020, he answers immediately: \"Trump.\"\n\nInterviews with dozens of Robert F Kennedy Jr supporters here point to a paradox about the independent candidate, one of the biggest wildcards in November's presidential election.\n\nConventional wisdom, backed up by some opinion polls, says that Mr Kennedy, a member of the country's most famous - and Democratic - political family, presents more of a threat to Joe Biden than to the Republican nominee Donald Trump.\n\nHowever, other recent surveys, interviews with supporters and a closer look at the issues that animate Mr Kennedy's base tell a different story - that perhaps Mr Trump is the candidate who should be more worried.\n\n\"Given the status of politics in Michigan right now, I would say he's probably more damaging to Trump,\" said Corwin Smidt, a politics professor at Michigan State University. \"But it's a very uncertain situation.\"\n\nMr Kennedy is consistently polling in the teens or high single digits, percentage-wise. By all indications he is the most popular independent or third-party candidate in decades.\n\nExperts say support for third-party candidates tends to decline closer to the election, and that Mr Kennedy is extremely unlikely to win the White House. Yet, because of the tight electoral map, his significant support has the potential to influence results in some states - including Michigan, a key battleground - and ultimately determine who becomes the next president.\n\nA campaign graphic displayed inside the theatre. The presidential administration of his uncle - John F Kennedy - was known as 'Camelot'\n\nJust a few miles away from the comedy show, local Republicans in suburban Macomb County hold a pro-Trump rally every Sunday at a wide intersection surrounded by strip malls, fast-food outlets and a gas station.\n\nThis is hotly contested territory. Mr Trump carried around 53 percent of voters in Macomb, in both 2016 and 2020.\n\nBut in the last election, the share of the vote going to third-party candidates declined, allowing Joe Biden to improve on Hillary Clinton's slice of the vote by about 3.5 percentage points. It was one small piece that allowed Biden to flip Michigan back into the Democratic column in 2020.\n\nAt the gathering of a couple of dozen Republicans waving American flags and handmade pro-Trump signs, reaction to the Kennedy campaign ranged from guffawing bemusement to mild approval.\n\nPeter Kiszczyc is a regular at these rallies. He says he's glad that independent candidates such as Mr Kennedy Jr and left-winger Cornel West have entered the race.\n\n\"Some leftists will vote for them,\" said Mr Kiszczyc, 69, who emigrated to Michigan from Poland in the 1980s. \"Some things I like about RFK, some I don't.\"\n\nBut he was in deep agreement with one of Mr Kennedy Jr's most noteworthy - and controversial - issues. \"All of us support his position against vaccination,\" he said, gesturing at the small crowd of Trump fans.\n\nPeter Kiszczyc is a local Republican activist who agrees with Kennedy on one thing - his stance on vaccinations\n\nAfter a career as an environmental lawyer, Mr Kennedy headed the anti-vaccine organisation Children's Health Defense. Its support and fundraising skyrocketed - as did Mr Kennedy's profile - during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nHis activism has put Mr Kennedy on the opposite side to most Democrats of a cultural and political divide that formed during the pandemic - and which was particularly acute in Michigan.\n\nIn April 2020, then-President Trump focused his ire on Gretchen Whitmer, the state's Democratic governor, for imposing lockdown measures, tweeting: \"LIBERATE MICHIGAN!\" The state was the site of numerous protests against Ms Whitmer's Covid policies, including tense armed rallies at the state capitol.\n\n\"A lot of the anti-Whitmer voters went for Trump in 2020,\" said Mr Smidt, the Michigan State professor.\n\nHe noted that many Michiganders drawn towards Mr Kennedy's position on healthcare and vaccines tend to lean conservative - and thus would more naturally fall into Mr Trump's camp.\n\n\"Democrats in Michigan are not like Democrats in California,\" he said.\n\nA number of Kennedy supporters back at the theatre - who paid $99 each for a comedy ticket - declared that they were opposed to lockdowns, masks, and Covid vaccines.\n\n\"I think the whole pandemic was mismanaged,\" said Sara White, a 43-year-old mother who said she opposed school closings and vaccine mandates. Ms White described herself as a former Democrat - \"I voted for Obama,\" she said - but noted that in 2020, she cast her ballot for Mr Trump.\n\nThe evening began with a short campaign video made by the creator of Plandemic, a series of conspiratorial documentaries about Covid.\n\nThe jokes skewed towards issues on the Make America Great Again agenda, including poking fun at gender terminology, \"woke\" young people and National Public Radio.\n\nAfter the comedy, Mr Kennedy remarked: \"There are people outside tonight who worry that I'm going to take votes away from President Biden and get President Trump elected.\n\n\"And there are people who I run into every day who are worried that I'm going to take votes away from President Trump and get President Biden elected. And both of them think that's going to be the end of our republic\u2026 I think our democracy is stronger than that.\"\n\nMr Kennedy's \"pox on both your houses\" message resonates with Liz Glass, a 59-year-old self-described recovering Democrat who owns a deli in Boyne City, in northwest Michigan. She voted for Mr Biden in 2020, but won't again.\n\n\"I'm disgusted,\" she said in a phone interview. \"It seems like the two major parties just want you to hate the other one, more than they have anything to offer that's positive.\"\n\nBut Mr Kennedy looks unlikely to be able to take advantage of one the biggest issues for disaffected Democrats, including Michigan's sizable Arab-American population - the continuing war in Gaza. A staunch ally of Israel, he has rejected calls for a ceasefire.\n\nDemocratic protesters outside Mr Kennedy's comedy fundraiser called the independent candidate a \"spoiler\"\n\nThe two main candidates are - for obvious reasons - attempting to paint Mr Kennedy as a natural ally of the opposite side.\n\nMr Trump has offered various opinions on RFK Jr, calling him \"Crooked Joe Biden's Political Opponent, not mine\" on his Truth Social account - but more recently calling him \"a Democrat 'Plant'\".\n\nThe interactions between the two have been even more complicated than that. Although Mr Kennedy is a frequent critic of Mr Trump, he claims that he was approached by allies to see if he would be interested in being Mr Trump's running mate. The Trump campaign has vigorously denied the claim.\n\nBrian Hughes, a senior Trump adviser, called Mr Kennedy an \"ultra-leftist\".\n\n\"Despite the dreams of the liberal echo chamber, Kennedy is an existential threat to Joe Biden not President Trump,\" Mr Hughes said in a statement, citing Mr Kennedy's views on taxes, fossil fuels and gun control. \"That's why Biden and his liberal cronies are desperately fighting to keep Kennedy off the ballot in several states.\"\n\nHowever, a recent NBC News survey indicated that 15% of Trump supporters would switch their votes to Mr Kennedy when presented with his name as an option - as compared to 7% of Biden voters.\n\nThat's a break from several previous polls which showed Mr Kennedy pulling more support away from Mr Biden.\n\nDemocrats are still worried about that possibility. Local Democratic activists protesting outside the fundraiser called him a \"spoiler\". And Democrats have mounted legal challenges to Kennedy's efforts to get on the ballot. In Michigan those have come to naught, as Kennedy recently gained ballot access after being nominated by the tiny Natural Law Party.\n\nIn a statement to the BBC, Michigan Democratic Party Chair Lavora Barnes took aim at the Kennedy campaign. \"The choice is clear this November, we must re-elect President Biden, and there are simply no alternatives,\" she said.\n\nAt this point in the campaign the overall effect of Kennedy's bid is unknowable, said Merrill Matthews, a resident scholar with the conservative Institute for Policy Innovation who has studied the history of third-party campaigns.\n\nBut, Mr Matthews said, his presence in the race could cause a number of surprises, not only in close battlegrounds like Michigan but states which seem relatively safe for either candidate.",

        "text": "How Trump changed his stance on absentee and mail voting \u2014 which he used to blame for election fraud\nWhy some Wisconsin voters stand by Trump despite legal cases\n\nFormer President Donald Trump announced a major change in a long-held position, and it's one that could boost his numbers at the ballot box this fall.\n\nWith little fanfare, in a post on Truth Social last Friday evening, Trump urged supporters to use early and absentee voting methods.\n\n\"ABSENTEE VOTING, EARLY VOTING, AND ELECTION DAY VOTING ARE ALL GOOD OPTIONS. REPUBLICANS MUST MAKE A PLAN, REGISTER, AND VOTE!\" Trump wrote.\n\nThe post \u2014 a marked shift in Trump's rhetoric about voting practices \u2014 is the result of a monthslong effort by advisers close to the former president and external groups, CBS News has learned.\n\nSenior advisers have been encouraging him to embrace votes \"no matter how they come,\" according to a high-ranking Republican source with knowledge of the conversations.\n\n\"He understands that a lot of his supporters want to get out and vote for him, and that's a resource advantage to us,\" the source said.\n\nTrump has opposed early, absentee and mail voting for years, blaming the practices for election fraud and conditioning voters to distrust those methods. He has repeatedly called only for in-person voting on Election Day and paper ballots, even though he has routinely used early voting.\n\n\"We have to get rid of mail-in ballots because once you have mail-in ballots, you have crooked elections,\" Trump said in his victory speech after the Iowa caucuses in January.\n\nOne of the key factors in bringing Trump around on early and mail-in voting was the data advisers were able to show him that suggested the campaign could effectively broaden its outreach to swing voters in battleground states if the Republican base was comfortable with voting early.\n\nAdvisers believe this would enable Trump to level the playing field with Mr. Biden on Election Day, since Democrats have historically benefitted from early and absentee voting.\n\nHowever, it remains to be seen whether Trump can consistently encourage early-voting efforts leading up to the election. There are already signs that old habits may lead to some mixed messaging. On Thursday night, in an interview with Newsmax, Trump said elections need to be brought back to \"paper ballots.\"\n\n\"You need voter ID and same-day voting,\" Trump said. Most ballots cast in the U.S. have a paper record \u2014 93% did in 2020, according to the Brennan Center.\n\nVoter behavior shifted dramatically in 2020: more Americans embraced early voting as the coronavirus pandemic complicated and depressed in-person voting.\n\nSixty-nine percent of voters nationwide cast their ballot either by mail or voted early in the 2020 election, making it the highest rate of nontraditional voting in a presidential election, according to the Census.\n\nIn addition to the change in Trump's rhetoric, Republicans will have to contend with a widening chasm between the two parties on support for absentee and early voting. Overall, the gap between Democrats and Republicans on early voting has increased, although it varies by state, says Kabir Khanna, CBS News' deputy director of Elections & Data Analytics.\n\nFor example, Pennsylvania \u2014 a key battleground \u2014 has exhibited the largest party splits by vote method. In 2020, Mr. Biden won the mail-in and absentee votes by over 50 points, while Trump won the Election Day vote by over 30 points. Ultimately, Mr. Biden narrowly won the state by a margin of 1.2%.\n\nHowever, in other battleground states where voting by mail has been more common in recent years, both parties tend to take advantage of early voting.\n\nIn Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina and Texas, the vast majority of ballots for both candidates were cast ahead of Election Day in 2020 \u2014 about 80-90% depending on the state, meaning most Biden and Trump voters cast their ballots early in these four states in the height of the pandemic. Texas has a long in-person early-voting period but strictly limits mail-in voting.\n\nStill, Republican voters in these states tend to favor voting in person more than voting by mail these days, Khanna says.\n\n\"In Georgia and North Carolina, more Trump voters than Biden voters showed up to vote early in person in 2020,\" Khanna said. \"Persuading them to vote absentee may be a bigger lift for the campaign.\"\n\nThe shift in Trump's rhetoric comes also as new leadership at the Republican National Committee has made revitalizing absentee and early voting programs, known as ABEV for short, a top priority.\n\nThe RNC's existing program, titled \"Bank Your Vote,\" was launched in 2023 and included websites educating voters in all 50 states about how to vote early.\n\nThe embrace of early voting practices was met with open arms by Republican groups that lobbied Trump advisers for a change and stressed that more needed to be done ahead of November.\n\nJessica Anderson, the president of the conservative super PAC Sentinel Action Fund, which focuses heavily on turning out early and absentee voters, said an embrace of ABEV programs would be a game changer for Republicans in the 2024 presidential race.\n\n\"President Trump's embrace of early and absentee voting should be a clarion call for conservatives to unite behind this winning strategy for 2024,\" Anderson said. \"We can no longer go into Election Day hundreds of thousands of votes behind because we refuse to adapt to the rules on the ground \u2014 as much as we may not like them.\"\n\nKabir Khanna contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Democrats are worried. But will RFK Jr take more votes away from Trump?\nMike Panza showed up early to a comedy benefit to support the Kennedy campaign for president.\n\nWearing a Star Wars-themed shirt and queuing outside the Royal Oak Theatre in this Detroit suburb, he talked about what drew him to the one candidate in the 2024 race identifiable solely by his initials - RFK Jr.\n\n\"I'd like a return to the middle of the road,\" said Mr Panza, 44. \"His stance on health care is really appealing. Kennedy wants to make people healthy, he wants to make the country healthy.\"\n\nMr Panza, who works as an environmental officer, might sound like a disaffected Democrat. But when I ask who he voted for in 2020, he answers immediately: \"Trump.\"\n\nInterviews with dozens of Robert F Kennedy Jr supporters here point to a paradox about the independent candidate, one of the biggest wildcards in November's presidential election.\n\nConventional wisdom, backed up by some opinion polls, says that Mr Kennedy, a member of the country's most famous - and Democratic - political family, presents more of a threat to Joe Biden than to the Republican nominee Donald Trump.\n\nHowever, other recent surveys, interviews with supporters and a closer look at the issues that animate Mr Kennedy's base tell a different story - that perhaps Mr Trump is the candidate who should be more worried.\n\n\"Given the status of politics in Michigan right now, I would say he's probably more damaging to Trump,\" said Corwin Smidt, a politics professor at Michigan State University. \"But it's a very uncertain situation.\"\n\nMr Kennedy is consistently polling in the teens or high single digits, percentage-wise. By all indications he is the most popular independent or third-party candidate in decades.\n\nExperts say support for third-party candidates tends to decline closer to the election, and that Mr Kennedy is extremely unlikely to win the White House. Yet, because of the tight electoral map, his significant support has the potential to influence results in some states - including Michigan, a key battleground - and ultimately determine who becomes the next president.",

        "text": "UMMA Leads Coalition of Art Museums Across the Country in Unprecedented Civic Engagement Campaign Ahead of 2024 Election \u2013 University of Michigan Museum of Art\nAs reported recently in the New York Times, a coalition of 10 art museums, all on public university campuses, are set to play a crucial role in the 2024 U.S. presidential election season. Brought together by UMMA to share their collective work, these museums will present a series of non-partisan exhibitions and events across the country aimed at showcasing the power of art in fostering civic engagement.\n\nGuided by the shared belief that art museums play an integral role in strengthening civil society, the collective plans support a more engaged citizenry, provide places for people to come together collectively, learn to disagree, and build empathy across differences.\n\nIn addition to UMMA, the coalition consists of art museums on college campuses including those at Michigan State University, Penn State University, UCLA, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, University of Iowa, University of Nebraska, University of Oregon, and University of Wisconsin-Madison. Many of the museums are in areas of the country often cited as \u201cpurple states,\u201d where political divisions can be heightened.\n\nDesigned to unify disparate conversations around democracy and bridge political divides across their varied campuses, the coalition will host high-profile exhibitions, public programs, and collaborative initiatives each designed for their unique communities. Many of these programs have begun to roll out and will continue into the Fall 2024 election season.\n\n\u201cThere is no better place for this kind of community building and civic participation than art museums,\u201d said Christina Olsen, Director of UMMA. \u201cArt brings people together and helps us understand and accept our differences in ways few other things can. This partnership with other art museums on college campuses makes it clear how essential the role we all play in our communities can be.\u201d\n\nThese collective efforts aim to make a meaningful and tangible difference in: countering political polarization; exploring democratic values through art; creating educational opportunities for the public audiences they serve; demystifying the voting process for young and first-time voters; and driving awareness and action through engagement in civic life.\n\nUMMA will also organize plans to release an \u201cElection Dialogue Deck\u201d, a deck of cards featuring works of art from all 10 collections, which includes guidance and prompts for hosting conversation exercises for political reflection. Physical versions of the decks of cards will be available at all campuses, and a digital version will be made available this fall.\n\n\u201cArtists have long confronted the thorniest and most difficult issues of their times, and works of art do incredible work in nurturing complex conversations,\u201d said Jon Seydl, Director of the Krannert Museum at UI Urbana-Champaign. \u201cIt makes good sense to draw on our collections and exhibitions to think together about our current moment. Our coalition also provides a laboratory in which each of our museums can learn from one another and our communities.\u201d\n\nAdditional details about each museum\u2019s plans are shared below (in alphabetical order):\n\nMichigan State University (Eli and Edythe Broad Art Museum)\u2014The Eli and Edythe Broad Art Museum will partner with The Judith Center, a new non-profit organization founded by artist Kathryn Andrews that brings together women artists, activists, and thought leaders to spur conversation. Together the MSU Broad Art Museum and the Judith Center will commission artists to create posters that deal with the issue of misogyny and sexism in the U.S. and the lack of representation and involvement of women in politics. The initial five commissioned posters will be displayed at the museum, just steps away from the Michigan state capitol in Lansing, starting in spring 2024, leading up to and through the fall election cycle.\n\nThe Pennsylvania State University (Palmer Museum of Art) \u2014 will feature the rich diversity of art being produced by native, transplanted, and adopted Pennsylvanians in the present moment that speak to the politics of race and representation, activism and social justice, while Politics and Daily Life, will present a range of politically inflected imagery from the permanent collection to catalyze conversations around empowerment, injustice, propaganda, patriotism, and protest. In addition, the Palmer will host a series of student engagement programs, including a \u201cFight for Your Rights pARTy\u201d and \u201cThe Art of the Vote,\u201d where Penn State students can register to vote and reflect on the power of art to communicate, question, and inspire change.\n\nRutgers University (Zimmerli Art Museum) \u2014In fall 2024, the Zimmerli Art Museum will continue its collaboration with the Eagleton Institute\u2019s Center for Youth Political Participation, a non-partisan effort to register, mobilize, and engage Rutgers University students to participate in politics and vote in local, state and national elections. The effort, known as RU Voting, will organize volunteers to conduct voter registration campaigns at museum events, including Zimmerli\u2019s monthly art party, SparkNight. RU Voting Interns are leading the ongoing efforts that began in January 2024. In addition, the Zimmerli will open Smoke and Mirrors, an exhibition that disrupts normative ideas about accessibility in public spaces by showcasing fifteen artists with disabilities, organized by guest curator Dr. Amanda Cachia (University of Houston), a leading scholar in disability studies and activism.\n\nUCLA (Hammer Museum) \u2014 The Hammer Museum has been a voting center and polling location for several election cycles; that will continue during the 2024 presidential election. The museum will host a variety of democracy and civic engagement-related programming this year, including a Super Tuesday Viewing Party, a documentary film series about elections, and an event related to the U.S. Constitution.\n\nUniversity of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (Krannert Art Museum)\u2014The Krannert Art Museum will open a collaborative installation interrogating ideas of democracy, social justice, and social movements. The installation will feature works selected by the Krannert community, including local high school students. It will be installed on the Museum\u2019s entrance wall during the fall 2024 semester. In addition, the museum will host an arts advocacy event \u2013 in tandem with a state organization \u2013 to provide training for advocacy for the regional arts communities of Champaign-Urbana.\n\nUniversity of Iowa (Stanley Museum of Art) \u2014The Stanley Museum of Art will open To My Friends at Horn: Keith Haring and Iowa City on May 4, 2024. Keith Haring envisioned a world where art functioned as a pillar of education and civic life, and this was particularly evident in his dedication to working with children. By revisiting the artist\u2019s two trips to Iowa City, where he painted a mural at an elementary school in 1989, this exhibition considers the artist\u2019s commitment to freedom of expression as foundational for a democracy to flourish. Also on view is Generations, an installation of the permanent collection that focuses on displacement, immigration, and transnational circulation, questions of equity and sovereignty, and ecological crisis.\n\nUniversity of Michigan (UMMA) \u2014After hosting successful voting initiatives in 2020 and 2022, UMMA is expanding its commitment to civic responsibility and demystifying the voting process. In collaboration with the Creative Campus Voting Project (CCVP) led by Stephanie Rowden and Hannah Smotrich, UMMA will transform one of its galleries into a fully functional City Clerk\u2019s office to allow registration, absentee ballot requests, and early voting for Ann Arbor voters. CCVP will design the space with artful elements to make voting accessible and anxiety-free. In addition, artist Philippa Pham Hughes will curate an exhibition involving works from the Museum\u2019s collection arranged on a commissioned mural installed directly on the gallery wall. Hughes\u2019 installation will be an interactive experience and include relational events, discussions, and lectures aimed at engaging the \u201cexhausted majority\u201d to counter political polarization.\n\nUniversity of Nebraska (Sheldon Museum of Art) \u2014 The Sheldon Museum of Art exhibition (In)credible: Exploring Trust and Misperceptions encourages visitors to consider how we sort through the vast amount of available information to determine what is, or is not, trustworthy. During the fall 2024 semester, a second iteration of the installation will build upon the first, directly tying media literacy to voter rights and election fairness. Sheldon is also working with Husker Vote Coalition, a nonpartisan University of Nebraska-Lincoln committee run out of UNL\u2019s Student Leadership, Involvement, and Community Engagement Office, to host voter registration tables where people can register to vote, check their voter registration status, sign up to vote by mail for elections in Nebraska or out of state, and learn more about voting.<\n\nUniversity of Oregon (Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art) \u2014The museum\u2019s major fall exhibition, Necroarchivos de las Americas \u2013 An Unrelenting Search for Justice, explores art from across Latin America that confronts political violence, whether created by the state or by political and private actors operating outside the bounds of the established order. In works that range widely in artistic method and aesthetic strategy, Necroarchivos (\u201cdeath files\u201d) poses the question of what price societies pay when the rule of law breaks down, or when the state actively takes arms against its own citizens. Artists represented include Doris Salcedo, Rafael Lozano-Hemmer, Teresa Margolles, Voluspa Jarpa, Luis Camnitzer, and others.\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison (Chazen Museum of Art) \u2014 The Chazen Museum of Art has served as a polling place for the City of Madison since 2020, which will continue with the 2024 election cycle. The museum opens early on election day and turns over its spacious lobby to poll workers and citizens of the precinct.",

        "text": "Local Elections in Turkey: How did we get here and what\u2019s next?\nTurkey\u2019s March local elections unseated President Re\u00e7ep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s Justice and Development Party (AKP) in several cities and districts nationwide. The AKP lost all but 12 metropolitan municipalities (out of 30) and 21 city municipalities (out of 50) to the opposition, ceding the local governments in Turkey\u2019s largest and most vibrant cities with larger tax bases and greater financial potential. Coming in second in an election for the first time since 2001, this was a surprising defeat to the ruling party, which had built its way to political hegemony in the country through municipal services and the provision of local social and public goods.\n\nFor over two decades, Erdo\u011fan designed Turkey\u2019s past, present, and future. First elected mayor of \u0130stanbul in 1994, Erdo\u011fan rose to prominence in Turkish politics thanks to his performance in the metropolitan municipality. Since 2002, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s AKP has become a dominant force thanks to successive electoral wins, thereby controlling the national government, overseeing most municipalities, and designing the country\u2019s political institutions. In the 2023 national elections, Erdo\u011fan once again won the presidential race and captured the majority of the seats in the parliament, including several seats won by the far-right Islamist parties.\n\nShift to the right\n\nIn the lead-up to the twin elections of May 2023, Erdo\u011fan, wary that he might lose the presidential seat and parliamentary majority, was concerned with the deepening economic crisis. Inflation had soared to 70%, and relief efforts following the February 2023 earthquake were poorly managed.\n\nIn response to his government's growing failures, Erdo\u011fan hoped that ideological appeal to religious and nationalist values and political polarization would consolidate his base; his supporters feared that Turkey\u2019s religion, family values, and national integrity were at stake.\n\nTo consolidate the right-wing vote, he co-opted far-right parties with more conservative agendas, like the Kurdish Islamist Huda-Par and neo-Islamist YRP, to preempt defection among his supporters. Erdo\u011fan accepted some of the YRP\u2019s demands, which broadly included that the AKP government quit attempts to establish gender equality, repeal the legislation to prevent violence against women and domestic violence, restrict the scope of alimony payments to women, and criminalize adultery.\n\nThe AKP\u2019s electoral alliance with the far-right reinforced its shift toward autocratic Islamization, which had been underway in the last decade.\n\nThe AKP\u2019s electoral alliance with the far-right reinforced its shift toward autocratic Islamization, which had been underway in the last decade. Since 2011, Erdo\u011fan, with his growing popularity, exerted greater influence over the Turkish media and courts, suffocated Turkish civil society, and put pressure on electoral councils to overturn results when they were unfavorable. As he subverted democratic practices, he also hollowed out secularism and turned public institutions into agents of Islamization.\n\nErdo\u011fan redefined the mission of the Directorate of Religions Affairs (Diyanet) to expand its scope of activities to \u201cprotection of the family,\u201d while the government restricted abortion and insisted that women have at least three children, stop having Cesarean sections, and refrain from divorce. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s government also \u2018reformed\u2019 the education system to introduce greater religious content into the school curriculum and increase the number of religious schools, which received a disproportionate share of the public budget.\n\nAfter carrying out a series of symbolic gestures, in 2021, President Erdo\u011fan pulled Turkey out of the Council of Europe\u2019s Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence Against Women (The \u0130stanbul Convention), which the country hosted and signed in 2011.\n\nWhen Turkey\u2019s vibrant women\u2019s rights movement mobilized to protest this decision, the AKP government reacted with force, restricting their freedom to protest and assemble. Women\u2019s rights activists were detained and harassed by security forces while pro-government media defamed their activism as anti-Islamic and anti-family. Women\u2019s associations have also been subject to increased scrutiny by the Ministry of Interior which carries out frequent audits. The courts placed further pressure on the movement when a prosecutor initiated an investigation against the largest women\u2019s platform for alleged \u201cillegal and immoral activities.\u201d\n\nAKP\u2019s twin pivot towards Islamization and authoritarianism posed serious threats to political rights and civil liberties and challenged the country\u2019s secular democratic institutions.\n\nAKP\u2019s twin pivot towards Islamization and authoritarianism posed serious threats to political rights and civil liberties and challenged the country\u2019s secular democratic institutions. Despite this growing repression, the women\u2019s rights movement remained resilient and the most visible pro-democratic movement in the country.\n\nAKP in recent elections\n\nStill, Erdo\u011fan managed to get elected president in 2023. So, why did he lose the local elections ten months later?\n\nAlthough the opposition bloc was demoralized and disintegrated after the May 2023 elections, leadership change in the main opposition, deepening economic hardships for middle and low-income families, and the lower stakes of local elections affected the outcome. The fact that the YRP split the vote by fielding its candidates against the AKP also enabled defections among Erdo\u011fan supporters and made the YRP the third-largest party with more than 6% of the votes.\n\nAside from these short-term factors, Turkey, despite Erdo\u011fan\u2019s autocratic leadership, has a strong democratic stock. Since the first multi-party election in 1950, Turkish voters have gone to the polls to hold their leaders accountable for their underperformance. Women held suffrage since the 1930s and have been a critical part of electoral politics and regularly exercised their rights, even if they have yet to achieve equal representation in elected offices. They indeed formed the majority of voters in the local elections.\n\nTheir choices have, in fact, given direction to Turkish politics. Conservative women, for instance, have long supported Erdo\u011fan partly because he expanded the educational and professional space for women who wear headscarves.\n\nThe party\u2019s increasing attacks on women\u2019s rights did not help either, as younger devout women have begun to turn their backs on Erdo\u011fan\u2019s party.\n\nThat support has started to wane in recent months, though. Many defected as they faced challenges in managing family finances due to rampant inflation and declining real wages. The fact that mayors from the main opposition party catered to their local needs with free transportation for mothers, as well as subsidized childcare, milk, and bread, made them a viable option to the underperforming and increasingly corrupt AKP. The party\u2019s increasing attacks on women\u2019s rights did not help either, as younger devout women have begun to turn their backs on Erdo\u011fan\u2019s party.\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nThe local elections proved that Turkish democracy is quite resilient, and the public has maintained its sense of efficacy and electoral accountability despite the country's recent shift toward authoritarianism.\n\nAlthough the recent political trends seem to favor the opposition, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s government will remain in charge of national, economic, social, and educational policies until 2028. He also has an oversized influence over the media and the courts. Besides, the YRP is now the third largest party. To co-opt the party and appeal to its base, Erdo\u011fan may pursue greater conservatism and make policy concessions, which may directly affect women.\n\nHe might submit to the pressure of this small but vocal conservative group. He could try to set local governments up for failure by restricting their purviews and budgets, which could harm their prospects of delivering services to the people. He already tried this with the \u0130stanbul and Ankara municipalities, yet the local election results proved their limited impact. Still, Erdo\u011fan has a few tricks up his sleeve. The next four years will be critical for the future of democracy in Turkey.\n\nThe views expressed in this piece are those of the author and do not express the official position of the Wilson Center.",

        "text": "Voters in battleground states say the economy is a top issue\nWisconsin voters weigh in on immigration and economy ahead of presidential election\n\nVoters' impressions of how good each presidential candidate is for the economy could determine the outcome of the 2024 Presidential election.\n\nIn Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, where President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are engaged in close contests, most voters said the economy will be a major factor in deciding whom they will cast their ballot for, results from a CBS News and YouGov poll show.\n\nIn Michigan, 80% of voters say the economy is a top issue for them, followed by 77% of voters who say inflation is. Seventy-two percent of voters ranked the state of democracy as one of the issues that matter most to them. Biden currently has a narrow lead over Trump in the state.\n\nIn both Pennsylvania and Washington, 80% of voters similarly ranked the economy as one of the topics they care most about this election.\n\nOther lower-ranked topics included candidates' stances on gun policy, crime, the U.S.-Mexico border and abortion.\n\n\"It's so evident that the economy remains a central issue, but how people interpret the economy, the issues they want addressed to deal with their own economic situation \u2014 that's a complicated questions with complicated answers,\" said CBS News chief election and campaign correspondent Robert Costa.\n\nAbout 6 in 10 people polled by CBS News said they rated the economy as \"fairly bad\" or \"very bad,\" despite economic measures such as low unemployment, growing wages and a resilient stock market, which point to a strong U.S. economy.\n\nThat could pose a challenge for Democrats who Costa said are eager to get \"that labor voter, the union member\" to vote Democratic and pull ahead of Trump.\n\n\"They know that those working voters, at times hear the call of the Trump campaign and his message on immigration. And it can be appealing to those voters, and so that's why Democrats are really trying to focus on the economy by focusing on labor,\" Costa said.",

        "text": "How Foreign Governments Sway Voters with Online Manipulation\nAlmost half of the world population heads to elections in 2024. To counter disinformation activities aimed against the voters on social media, we must first understand how they work\n\nThe year 2024 is one of the biggest election years in history, with billions of people going to the polls around the globe. Although elections are considered protected, internal state affairs under international law, election interference between nations has nonetheless risen. In particular, cyber-enabled influence operations (CEIO) via social media\u2014including disinformation, misinformation or \u201cfake news\u201d\u2014have emerged as a singular threat that states need to counter.\n\nInfluence ops initially skyrocketed into public awareness in the aftermath of Russian election interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. They have not since waned. Researchers, policy makers and social media companies have designed varied approaches to counter these CEIOs. However, that requires an understanding, often missing, of how these operations work in the first place.\n\nInformation, of course, has been used as a tool of statecraft throughout history. Sun Tzu proposed more than 2,000 years ago that the \u201csupreme art of war\u201d is to \u201csubdue the enemy without fighting.\u201d To that end, information can influence, distract or convince an adversary that it is not in their best interest to fight. In the 1980s, for example, the Soviet Union initiated Operation Infektion/Operation Denver aimed at spreading the lie that AIDS was manufactured in the U.S. With the emergence of cyberspace, such influence operations have expanded in scope, scale and speed.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nVisions of cybergeddon\u2014including catastrophic cyber incidents wreaking havoc on communications, the power grid, waters supplies and other vital infrastructure, resulting in social collapse\u2014have captured public imagination and fueled much of the policy discourse (including references to a \u201ccyber Pearl Harbor\u201d).\n\nYet, cyber operations can take another form, targeting the humans behind the keyboards, rather than machines through code manipulation. Such activities conducted through cyberspace can be aimed at altering an audiences\u2019 thinking and perceptions, with the goal to ultimately change their behavior. Organizing political rallies in an adversary state would be an example of mobilization (behavioral change). As such, modern cyber-enabled influence operations represent a continuation of international competition short of armed conflict. As opposed to offensive cyber operations that might hack networked systems, shut down a pipeline or interrupt communications, they focus on \u201chacking\u201d human minds. That comes in particularly handy when a foreign power wants to meddle in someone else\u2019s domestic politics.\n\nCEIOs operate by establishing self-sustaining loops of information that can manipulate public opinion and fuel polarization. They are \u201ca new form of \u201cdivide and conquer\u201d applied to geopolitical condition of competition rather than in war,\u201d I recently argued with a co-author in the Intelligence and National Security journal.\n\nBut how do these operations work? In order to understand that, we can use the military concept of the observation-orientation-decision-action (OODA) loop, which is widely used in planning strategy and tactics. The model helps explain how individuals arrive at decisions relevant to daily life: individuals in a society (us) take information from our environment (observation) and make strategic choices as a result. In the case of a dogfight (close-range aerial battle), the strategic choice would lead to pilot\u2019s survival (and military victory). In day-to-day life, a strategic choice might be selecting the political leader that would best represent our own interests. Here, changing what is being observed by injecting additional information into the observation part of the OODA loop can have significant repercussions. CEIOs aim to do precisely that, by feeding different parts of the public with targeted messages at the observation stage aimed to ultimately change their actions.\n\nAmanda Monta\u00f1ez; Source: A Discourse on Winning and Losing, by John R. Boyd; Air University Press, 2018\n\nSo how do CEIOs interrupt the OODA loop using social media? Cyber-enabled influence operations function on common principles that can be understood through an identification-imitation-amplification framework. First, \u201coutsiders\u201d (malicious actors) identify target audiences and divisive issues through social media microtargeting.\n\nFollowing this, the \u201coutsiders\u201d may pose as members of the target audience by assuming false identities, through imitation which increases their credibility. An example is the 2016 Russian CEIO on Facebook, which bought ads to target U.S. audiences, manned by the infamous \u201ctroll factories\u201d in St. Petersburg. In these ads, trolls assumed false identities and used the language that suggested that they belonged to the targeted society. Then they try to achieve influence through messages designed to resonate with target audiences, promoting a sense of in-group belonging (at the expense of any larger assumed community, such as the nation). Such messages may take the form of traditional disinformation, but may also employ factually correct information. For this reason, using the term CEIO, instead of \u201cdisinformation,\u201d \u201cmisinformation\u201d or \u201cfake news,\u201d might provide more analytical precision.\n\nFinally, tailored messages are amplified, both in content (increasing and diversifying the number of messages) and by increasing the number of target groups. Amplification can also occur via cross-platform posting.\n\nConsider an example: a post by a recently enlisted soldier who recounts their lived experience of seeing September 11th on TV and says that it was this event that motivated them to join the military. This is a post that was shared by the Veterans Across the Nation Facebook page. The content of this post may be entirely fabricated, and VAN may not exist \u201cin real life.\u201d However, such a post, while fictional, can have the emotive impact of authenticity, particularly in how it is visually presented on a digital media platform. And it can be leveraged for purposes other than promoting a shared sense of patriotism, depending on to what content it becomes linked and amplified through.\n\nIn its CEIO using Facebook, the Russian Internet Research Agency targeted diverse domestic audiences in the U.S. through specifically crafted messaging aimed at interfering in the 2016 election , as recounted in the Mueller Report. Reportedly, 126 million Americans were exposed to Russian efforts to influence their views, and their votes, on Facebook. Different audiences heard different messages, with groups identified using Facebook\u2019s menu-style microtargeting features. Evidence shows that the majority of Russian-bought ads on Facebook targeted African Americans with messages that did not necessarily contain false information, but rather focused on topics including race, justice and police. Beyond the U.S., Russia reportedly targeted Germany, as well as the U.K.\n\nTo effectively make strategic decisions, individuals must correctly observe their environments. If the observed reality is filtered through a manipulated lens of divisiveness, manageable points of social disagreement (expected in healthy democracies) can be turned into potentially unmanageable divisions. For example, the popular emphasis on polarization in the U.S. ignores the reality that most people are not as politically polarized as they think. Trust in institutions can be undermined, even without the help of \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\nAs the identification-imitation-amplification framework highlights, the question of who can legitimately participate in debates and seek to influence public opinion is of crucial importance and has a bearing on what is the \u201creality\u201d that is being observed. When technology allows outsiders (foreign malicious actors) to credibly pose as legitimate members of a certain society, the potential risks of manipulation increase.\n\nWith about 49 percent of the global population participating in elections in 2024, we must counter CEIOs and election interference. Understanding imitation, identification and amplification is just the starting point. Foreign influence operations will utilize truthful information to sway public opinion. We must think deeply about what that means for domestic political affairs. Furthermore, if cyberspace provides access and anonymity facilitating influence operations aimed at swaying audiences and affecting elections, democracies must effectively limit that access to authentic, legitimate users while staying true to principles of free speech. This a hard task, one we urgently need to undertake.\n\nThis is an opinion and analysis article, and the views expressed by the author or authors are not necessarily those of Scientific American.",

Generate Key Takeaways\n\nA history professor whose formula has successfully predicted the outcome of all but one presidential election since 1984 has indicated that President Joe Biden is tracking to win in 2024.\n\nAllan Lichtman, who has been teaching at American University for five decades, uses a system of 13 \u201ckeys\u201d to the White House to make his call.\n\nIn a recent interview with the Guardian, Lichtman noted that Biden has already got two keys under his belt: the incumbency key, and the contest key, after he faced no serious contenders for the incumbent party nomination.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s two keys off the top. That means six more keys would have to fall to predict his defeat. A lot would have to go wrong for Biden to lose,\u201d Lichtman said.\n\nHe will likely make his final prediction in August, according to the Guardian.\n\nThe other keys, which are structured as true or false questions, include whether or not the incumbent candidate has been tainted by a major scandal, whether there has been social unrest during the term, whether the incumbent has achieved major military successes or failures, and whether or not the challenging candidate is charismatic or a national hero.\n\nHistory professor Allan Lichtman, pictured here lecturing at American University in 2008, claims he has a perfect record at predicting elections since 1984. NICHOLAS KAMM- via Getty Images\n\nLichtman\u2019s only blemish on his record is his prediction that Al Gore would defeat George W. Bush in 2000.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nBut Lichtman claims that call was nonetheless correct since Gore won the popular vote. He contends that Gore would have won the election had he not been wronged in Florida, which Bush won by a razor-thin margin, prompting a recount dispute and a highly controversial U.S. Supreme Court decision.\n\nHe was among a select few who predicted former President Donald Trump\u2019s win in 2016.\n\nHe noted, in his Guardian interview, that his system is \u201crobust\u201d because it is based on history \u2014 and unprecedented events are currently taking place.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s always possible there could be a cataclysmic enough event outside the scope of the keys that could affect the election, and here we do have, for the first time, not just a former president but a major party candidate sitting in a trial and who knows if he\u2019s convicted \u2014 and there\u2019s a good chance he will be \u2014 how that might scramble things,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nA national poll shared by CNN on Sunday shows Trump leading Biden by 6 percentage points despite currently being on criminal trial and facing felony charges in three other indictments.\n\nRelated...",

        "text": "Crisis in Somalia: What you need to know and how to help\nHere are five reasons why the International Rescue Committee\u2019s Emergency Watchlist ranks Somalia as one of the countries most at risk of experiencing a worsening humanitarian crisis in 2024.\n\nAt a glance At a glance 6.9 million in need of humanitarian support\n\n3.8 million people internally displaced\n\n4.3 million people facing crisis, or worse, levels of food insecurity\n\nSupport the IRC's response\n\nHeightened conflict and climate shocks are increasing humanitarian needs in Somalia as communities work to recover from the country\u2019s most severe drought in four decades, which has reduced food insecurity, nutrition and water, sanitation and hygiene levels across the country.\n\nThe drought and its subsequent impacts catapulted Somalia to the forefront of the Emergency Watchlist last year. Although urgent requirements persist, humanitarian needs are expected to gradually alleviate throughout 2024.\n\nHowever, the risk of climate shocks, coupled with political tensions and the government's offensive against the Al-Shabaab group, may intensify demands in Somalia, potentially reversing the progress made towards recovery.\n\nRead on to learn more about the risks that Somalia faces in 2024.\n\nSevere drought pushes Somalis to the brink of starvation\n\nSomalia faced its worst drought in four decades spanning from 2021 to 2023, resulting in a critical food crisis for 7.9 million people\u2014about half of Somalia\u2019s population. Drought-related impacts continue to affect 4.3 million individuals across Somalia including an estimated 727,000 who are teetering on the brink of starvation.\n\nThe drought also decimated livelihoods, especially those in the agro-pastoral sector. During the drought in Somalia, over 3.5 million livestock perished, equivalent to a third of the country's total. This has led to the devastation of livelihoods, triggering significant displacement and urban migration. Even if water and land conditions are rehabilitated, the recovery of livestock levels and the dependent livelihoods would span 5 to 10 years.\n\nFatuma, a mother of four, has lived in the Seenilow camp for internally displaced persons in Baidoa, Southwest State\u2014one of Somalia\u2019s regions most impacted by drought\u2014 for three years. She survived critical shortages of food and drinking water, brought on by Somalia\u2019s severe drought. Photo: Shukri Abdulkadir for the IRC\n\nClimate shocks poised to exacerbate needs\n\nSevere flooding in late 2023 displaced more than 706,000 people in central and southern Somalia, indicating the country\u2019s vulnerability to climate shocks. The flooding not only harmed bridges and roads, but also disrupted supply routes. Furthermore, it led to a rise in cases of diarrhea and cholera by impairing water and sanitation services and infrastructure.\n\nAs the country is set to enter its long rainy season, any additional flooding would exacerbate displacement and the spread of waterborne disease, particularly for people without access to clean water and sanitation services. This would devastate Somalia\u2019s already fragile agricultural and pastoral industries, leading to crop failures, reduced household purchasing power, elevated food prices, heightened dependence on imports and ultimately escalate the threat of food insecurity.\n\nThe Ban Edad is one of the several camps for internally displaced persons where flooding destroyed makeshift homes, critical infrastructure and contaminated water sources in 2023. Photo: Shukri Abdulkadir for the IRC\n\nClashes between government forces and nonstate groups will harm civilians\n\nThe Somali government launched a major offensive against Al-Shabaab in August 2022. Since then, the government has made limited territorial gains in central Somalia before pushing south into the group\u2019s traditional stronghold.\n\nThroughout the offensive, civilians have been displaced by violence\u2014accelerating the humanitarian needs brought on by food insecurity and climate shocks. As Al-Shabaab comes under pressure from government forces, civilian areas will remain vulnerable to large-scale violence. Populations in areas controlled by the armed group will likely face increased tax collection from the armed group.\n\nFurthermore, Al-Shabaab could seek to exploit the withdrawal of troops from the African Union\u2019s multidimensional military, police and civilian mission, mission in Somalia (ATMIS) and target civilians during Somalia\u2019s local and regional elections scheduled for June and November 2024.\n\nHalima and her five children moved to a camp for internally displaced people in Dhusamareb, Somalia after a combination of conflict and climate shocks forced them to leave their home in Bay for Dhusamareb. Photo: Mustafa Saeed for the IRC\n\nFragmented politics could drive violence\n\nIn February 2023, clashes erupted between Somaliland forces and Dhulbahante clan-affiliated troops in the contentious zone straddling Somaliland and Puntland State in northern Somalia. The conflict stems from disputes over the Las Anod region, claimed by both the secessionist administration of Somaliland and indigenous clan leaders, resulting in the displacement of over 150,000 individuals to date. Violence has largely subsided since October 2023 but no formal ceasefire has been agreed upon.\n\nAny reinvigoration of conflict in Las Anod would drive additional needs, displacement and strain critical services. Somaliland's upcoming presidential elections in 2024, following postponements from 2022, serve as a potential trigger for unrest.\n\nAlmost 7 million people in Somalia are in need of humanitarian support\u2014including the 3.8 million who are internally displaced. Photo: Shukri Abdulkadir for the IRC\n\nHumanitarian access constraints and funding shortfalls\n\nThe significant demand for humanitarian aid in Somalia is hampered by prolonged violence, impeding the efforts of aid workers to provide services. Accessing regions directly controlled by armed groups remains and will remain a formidable challenge.\n\nWhile the government makes limited territorial gains, continued fighting along supply lines will prevent the delivery of critical services and pose security risks to humanitarians. Consequently, ACAPS judges the humanitarian access constraints in Somalia to be \u201cvery high\u201d (4 out of 5).\n\nMeanwhile, Somalia\u2019s humanitarian response plan received just 45.8% of its necessary funding for 2023 and its 2024 plan has received just 10% of necessary funding by April. Aid delivery will falter while nearly half of Somalia\u2019s population requires humanitarian assistance.\n\nAn IRC mobile health team delivers malnutrition support in Olol Village, Dhusamareb district, Somalia. Photo: Mustafa Saeed for the IRC\n\nHow is the IRC supporting Somalia?\n\nThe IRC has been delivering critical services to crisis-affected communities in Somalia since 1981. We currently provide services in Galmudug, Southwest and Puntland states, as well as in the Banaadir (Mogadishu) region.\n\nIn Somalia, the IRC delivers programming in health, nutrition, water and sanitation services, women\u2019s protection and empowerment, and cash assistance. We are continuing our programming to address the impacts of drought and food insecurity and are expanding to new regions where humanitarian needs are mounting.\n\nLearn more about the IRC\u2019s response in Somalia.\n\nHassan Abdi and other members of the IRC\u2019s team at the Dhusamareb field base in Somalia support access to safe water, hygiene and sanitation, and health facilities.

        "text": "What Is the CHIPS Act?\nThe CHIPS and Science Act marks a substantial ramp-up of industrial policy in the United States. The legislation is sparking a great deal of investment activity in the U.S. semiconductor sector, but several challenges and potential pitfalls lie ahead.\n\nSupporters see the policy\u2014and the far-larger Inflation Reduction Act [PDF]\u2014 as a much-needed investment in critical technologies at a time of growing geopolitical friction and climate change. However, some critics fault them for attempting to pick winners and losers in the marketplace, expanding the federal debt, and pursuing too many policy objectives.\n\nDefining the CHIPS Act\n\nSigned into law in August 2022, the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) and Science Act is intended to lure microchip manufacturing back to the United States after several decades of individual companies offshoring the technology. Although the country produced close to 40 percent of the world\u2019s semiconductor supply in 1990, that statistic has slipped to just 12 percent. Taiwan, on the other hand, produces more than 60 percent of the world\u2019s supply of semiconductors and more than 90 percent of the most advanced chips. The United States does not produce any higher-end chips today.\n\nThe World This Week A weekly digest of the latest from CFR on the biggest foreign policy stories of the week, featuring briefs, opinions, and explainers.

Companies are also eligible for a 25 percent tax credit. U.S. and foreign companies with facilities in the United States are eligible for the federal incentives.\n\nThe Act\u2019s Effects Thus Far\n\nThe CHIPS Act has generated a flurry of business activity. Hundreds of companies have submitted statements of interest and requested more than $70 billion in subsidies\u2014nearly double the amount available. Companies have meanwhile announced more than $200 billion in private sector investments since the law passed, even as the Commerce Department is just beginning to dole out subsidies. Building new chip manufacturing facilities comes with a hefty price tag. A new facility can cost more than a nuclear power plant\u2014ranging in price from $5 billion to $20 billion.\n\nThe first CHIPS grant, totaling $35 million, went to BAE Systems\u2014a UK-based defense contractor\u2014in December 2023 to produce chips for F-15 and F-35 fighter jets. Intel, the American chipmaking giant, was approved in March 2024 to receive $8.5 billion in grants and $11 billion in loans\u2014the largest grant awarded to a chipmaker. Intel previously announced it would invest $100 billion over five years to build new U.S. facilities. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) will receive $6.6 billion in grants and $5 billion in loans to support three fabrication plants in Arizona. TSMC\u2019s plans to invest $65 billion in the United States marks the largest foreign direct investment in a greenfield project in U.S. history.\n\nThe Joe Biden administration says that those and other investments put the United States on track to meet the near-term goal of manufacturing 20 percent of the world\u2019s most advanced chips by the end of the decade.\n\nChallenges Ahead\n\nSome experts believe a CHIPS Act II or CHIPS Act III could be needed to completely revitalize the U.S. semiconductor industry and compete with inducements in foreign markets. The European Union passed a similar policy\u2014the European Chips Act\u2014just last year, which puts \u20ac43 billion into the bloc\u2019s industry through the end of the decade. China, on the other hand, has invested billions in the industry year after year\u2014not to mention in other technologies such as artificial intelligence\u2014though it too is heavily reliant on TSMC.\n\nKevin Lamarque/Reuters U.S. President Joe Biden looks at a semiconductor wafer, as he tours the Intel Campus in Chandler, Arizona, on March 20, 2024.\n\nDelays or disruptions to projects are also likely. TSMC and Intel have already delayed the opening of their facilities, pointing to higher costs for construction and issues with their suppliers. Another challenge facing semiconductor companies hoping to break ground in the United States is the current lack of a trained workforce.\n\nSome U.S. partners, businesses, and industry analysts have criticized the requirements and conditions the U.S. government has tied to the CHIPS incentives. South Korea\u2019s trade, industry, and energy minister last year, for example, took issue with stipulations he saw as atypical, including the need to submit business management information and childcare plans for their employees. Also, under the terms of CHIPS Act, chipmakers who are awarded funding are restricted from expanding their facilities in China and other \u201ccountries of concern\u201d for ten years.",

        "text": "FAU/Mainstreet Poll Finds Intriguing 2024 Presidential Race Dynamics\nFAU/Mainstreet Poll Finds Intriguing 2024 Presidential Race Dynamics\n\nAmerican voters share their views on the 2024 presidential race\n\nAs the 2024 presidential race heats up, a survey conducted by FAU Political Communication and Public Opinion Research Lab (PolCom Lab) and Mainstreet Research offers a glimpse into the shifting tides of American politics.\n\nGender, Age and Race Continue to Influence Voting Patterns\n\nIn a striking illustration of the gender gap, likely women voters express a preference for U.S. President Joe Biden (48%), while men exhibit a tilt toward former U.S. President Donald Trump (47%).\n\n\u201cThe divergence in attitudes underscores the complex interplay of gender dynamics in shaping electoral outcomes,\u201d said Dukhong Kim, Ph.D., associate professor of political science at FAU.\n\nAmong all voters, the poll found the two candidates tied at 44% each. However, Biden demonstrates stronger support from older middle-age groups (50-64: 51%) compared to younger middle-age groups (35-39: 32%), and from Black voters (67%) in contrast to non-college-educated white voters (33%). Conversely, Trump garners more support from younger middle-aged groups (50%) compared to younger cohorts (18-34: 32%), and non-college-educated white voters (56%) compared to Black (19%) or Latino voters (37%).\n\nRegarding party allegiance, Biden and Trump both command similar levels of support: Biden (79%) and Trump (81%). However, Independents lean more toward Trump (44%) than Biden (37%).\n\nAge and Personality Matter: Biden\u2019s Age vs. Trump\u2019s Persona\n\nAs voters weigh their options, age and personality factors emerge as pivotal considerations. Although concerns over Biden\u2019s age loom large among some former supporters, critiques of Trump\u2019s language and leadership style drive others away.\n\n\u201cFor those rejecting Trump, personality factors like his language and leadership style loom large, along with legal issues stemming from the Stormy Daniels case. Presidential character remains a major fault line,\u201d said Kevin Wagner, Ph.D., co-director of FAU\u2019s PolCom Lab and professor of political science.\n\nThird-Party Intrigue: Biden\u2019s Surprising Boost with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in the Mix\n\nA surprising twist unfolds with the inclusion of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as a candidate. Contrary to expectations, Biden\u2019s support strengthens with Kennedy in the race, hinting at intriguing dynamics within the electorate.\n\nRespondents were asked, \u201cIf the election for president were held today and the candidates were Joe Biden, Donald Trump, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., which candidate would you support?\u201d Respondents answered with 40% for Biden and 38% for Trump, while 13% selected Kennedy, 6% were undecided, and 3% preferred another candidate.\n\n\u201cInterestingly, Biden actually performs better when Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is included as a candidate, likely because Kennedy pulls more support from Trump\u2019s base than Biden\u2019s,\u201d said Luzmarina Garcia, Ph.D., assistant professor of political science at FAU.\n\nNew York Criminal Trial Has Little Impact on Trump Support\n\nRespondents were asked about Trump\u2019s trial in a New York criminal case regarding accusations of falsifying business records related to a nondisclosure agreement concerning an extramarital affair. When asked about the potential impact of Trump being found guilty on their vote in the presidential election, 64% of respondents indicated it would not sway their decision, while 26% said it would. Additionally, 10% were uncertain. Among registered Republicans, 12.3% acknowledged that a guilty verdict would influence their vote, with 75.7% asserting it would not.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s New York criminal case over alleged hush money payments appears poised to have a small impact. However, since the margins in many of the battleground states are expected to be only a few points, those voters could be the difference,\u201d said Kim.\n\nThe trial\u2019s strongest impact was among younger and non-white voters. Approximately 42% of those aged 18 to 34 said a guilty verdict would influence their vote, while roughly one-third of Black, Hispanic, and other racial and ethnic voters expressed similar sentiments.\n\nEnthusiasm Edge: Democrats Gain Ground in Down-Ballot Races\n\nAmidst the electoral fray, Democrats secure a modest uptick in support among likely voters on the congressional generic ballot (43% vs. 40%). This uptick hints at a potential enthusiasm advantage for Democratic candidates, setting the stage for a fiercely contested battle in down-ballot races nationwide.\n\nThe poll was conducted from Friday, April 26 to Sunday, April 28, among a sample of 1,046 adults, 18 years of age or older, living in the U.S. The survey was conducted using text message recruitment and IVR to complete the survey. Since the text messages were sent to random registered voters, the poll can be assigned a margin of error. The survey is intended to represent the voting population in the U.S. The margin of error for the poll is +/- 3 % at the 95 % confidence level. Margins of error are higher in each subsample.\n\n-FAU-",

        "text": "Political activity DOs and DON'Ts for Reserve Airmen\nIn our democracy, elections are quite common, and with a presidential election this year, we can expect many opportunities for citizens to participate in the democratic process. With this in mind, it is important to be aware of specific political activities guidelines that apply to Reserve service members.\n\n\n\nAll Service members are encouraged to undertake all acts of citizenship, including voting and participating in the political process. However, all reserve service members also have a duty to ensure that their personal activities do not imply official endorsement by the Department of Defense or Department of the Air Force. As individuals, we do not have to be politically neutral, but the Air Force does. The political activities policies outlined below help to ensure the DoD and the DAF as institutions do not influence or appear to be partisan in our nation's electoral process.\n\n\n\nDepartment of Defense Directive 1344.10, Political Activities by Members of the Armed Forces, and individual service regulations outline permitted and prohibited political activities by active duty, Reserve component, and retired service members. These rules regulate how and when service members are able to participate in the political process. Service members who violate these directives could face punishment under the Uniform Code of Military Justice and/or other criminal or administrative penalties.\n\nService members are encouraged to participate in the political process, but they must be careful about not engaging in political activities in the workplace and not using their official positions to advocate for or against political issues. With the directives set forth in DoDD 1344.10 and other regulations in mind, reserve service members should be aware of what they can and cannot do regarding political activities in and out of military status. The below do\u2019s/don\u2019ts are not exhaustive, and service members and employees should consult with their servicing legal office with any questions regarding their personal political activities.\n\n\n\nReserve Service Members Running for Civil Office :\n\nWhat is a civil office?\n\nAn elective office\n\nA Presidentially-appointed position\n\nA position on the executive schedule\n\nA civil office in a State, District of Columbia, a territory, possession, or commonwealth of the US, or any political subdivision\n\nReserve service members ordered to active duty for more than 270-days CANNOT be a nominee or candidate for civil office, unless the Secretary of the Air Force grants permission. For these Reservists on duty for more than 270 days, if SecAF grants permission \u2013 the service member CANNOT hold or exercise the functions of that office while in military status.\n\nReserve service members ordered to active duty for 270-days or fewer CAN remain or become a nominee for civil office (and exercise the functions/hold that office) provided there is no interference with the performance of their military duty.\n\nWhen running for civil office, members not in military status (or ordered to active duty 270 days or less) CAN:\n\nUse rank/grade/affiliation, but must clearly indicate their Reserve status\n\nInclude or permit the inclusion of their current or former specific military duty, title, or position, or photographs in military uniform when displayed with other non-military biographical details\n\nBut! The reserve service member must include a clear and prominent disclaimer when invoking their military status\n\nWhen running for civil office, members not in military status (or ordered to active duty 270 days or less) CANNOT:\n\nUse or allow the use of photographs, drawings, and other similar media of themselves in uniform as the primary graphic representation in any campaign media\n\nDepict or allow their depiction in uniform in a manner that does not accurately reflect their actual performance of duty\n\nPer DoDI 1334.01, Wearing of the Uniform, all service members are prohibited from wearing their uniform during or in connection with furthering political activities, regardless of their status. DoDD 1344.10 and DAF Instruction 51-508 otherwise require reserve service members to be in a military status for the following provisions to apply. These statuses include active duty and inactive duty for training.\n\nVOTING :\n\nCAN: All service members can vote, register to vote and encourage others to vote. Airmen may also fully participate in the Federal Voting Assistance Program.\n\nCANNOT: Use your influence or authority to force others to vote or to interfere with the outcome of the election.\n\nPOLITICAL ACTIVITIES (BOTH PARTISAN & NON PARTISAN) :\n\nCAN: Join political clubs and attend meetings, rallies, fundraisers, debates, and conventions, when not in uniform and not on duty.\n\nCANNOT: Take part in political activities while on duty, in uniform, or as an official representative of the Air Force, or use Air Force property and resources for political purposes. Airmen are never permitted, on or off duty, to join or participate in groups that advocate a supremacist ideology or aim to deny civil rights to individuals.\n\nEXPRESSING POLITICAL VIEWS :\n\nCAN: As a private citizen, and not an official representative of the Air Force, you can sign petitions, display one bumper sticker on your private vehicle, wear political accessories or apparel when not on duty or in uniform or in a federal building, and write a letter expressing your views to editor of newspaper (if you clearly state that the views expressed are those of the individual only and not those of the Air Force or the DoD).\n\nCANNOT: Display political signs or banners other than a bumper sticker on your private vehicle, display signs and banners on base housing, and commissioned officers can\u2019t use contemptuous words against the President and other elected or appointed leaders.\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA :\n\nCAN: Follow and post, like, share, or retweet a message in support of or opposition to a political party, candidate in a partisan race, or partisan political group when not on duty, and not in the workplace.\n\nCANNOT: Do any of the above as an official social media account of the Air Force, use your military rank or official title when posting, or post links to partisan sites or links to partisan fundraising sites. Don\u2019t use social media accounts that are designated for work purposes in your official capacity to engage in politics, and don\u2019t send messages to subordinates that are about partisan politics.\n\nPROTESTS & DEMONSTRATIONS :\n\nCAN: Attend and participate in protests, demonstrations, and similar activities when CONUS, off duty, and not in uniform.\n\nCANNOT: Attend such activities in foreign countries, if such participation includes illegal activity like a breach of the peace, or if the activity is likely to cause violence.\n\nDONATIONS :\n\nCAN: Make monetary donations to political organizations and committees.\n\nCANNOT: Exceed the contribution limits stated in 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441a, solicit donations online or in the workplace.\n\nPOLL WORKERS :\n\nCAN: Serve as an election official (poll worker) in a non-partisan capacity when you have the SECAF\u2019s approval.\n\nCANNOT: Serve as an election official in a partisan capacity, or when in uniform, or when it would interfere with military duties.\n\nService members are encouraged to review DoDD 1344.10 and DAFI 51-508, Political Activities, Free Speech and Freedom of Assembly to understand permissible political activity.\n\nAll members are encouraged to review the Deputy Secretary of Defense\u2019s Feb. 15 2024 memorandum on political activities, available at: https://dodsoco.ogc.osd.mil/Portals/102/Documents/Political%20Activities%20Docs/2024%20DSD%20Memo%20on%20Political%20Activities.pdf?ver=cn0AKGr7lW7iEmpLRuuAUA%3D%3D.\n\n\n\nThe information in this article is provided for informational purposes and is not intended as legal advice.

        "text": "2024 Election Spending Skyrockets\n2024 Election Spending Skyrockets\n\nApril 30, 2024\n\n\n\nThe 2024 Election is shaping up to be one of the most expensive campaign seasons in history, right on the heels of a 2020 election that involved a record level of spending.\n\nWhy it matters: Election spending is skyrocketing, from $6.5 billion in 2016 to $14.4 billion in 2020 and an expected $15.9 billion in 2024. The amount raised by each party, how early funds are raised, and how quickly they are spent can tell us a great deal about the standings of various political races, beyond the polling.\n\nHow will this affect the races?\n\nWhile there is a large amount of media focus on the financial advantage for Democrats, money does not always result in a victory.\n\nIn 2016, former Senator and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton outraised former President Donald Trump $769 million to $433 million and lost the race for the presidency.\n\nIn 2020, President Joe Biden won at the ballot box and was successful as a fundraiser, drawing $1.5 billion to Trump\u2019s $1 billion.\n\nHowever, a lack of funds can limit a candidate\u2019s ability to travel, make expensive ad-buys, and organize voter registration and engagement. Fundraising for down-ballot Senate and House races can be even more crucial, as presidential campaigns receive much more media coverage.\n\nWhere does the 2024 Presidential election stand?\n\nThe race will once again come down to the following seven states: Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Georgia, Arizona, North Carolina, and Nevada. All of these states were decided by a margin of 3% or less in the 2020 election, with Arizona and Georgia being decided by less than 0.5%. Current polling has Biden and Trump within 5% of each other in these states.\n\nBoth of the Presidential campaigns as well as Congressional campaigns are raising record amounts. The Biden campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) raised $90 million in March, while President Trump and the RNC raised $65.6 million.\n\nThe Biden campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) had $192 million cash on hand as of the end of March.\n\nThe Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee (RNC) had $93 million cash on hand late last month.\n\nThe narrative on fundraising has largely focused on Biden\u2019s significant and likely insurmountable cash advantage over the Trump campaign.\n\nThe Trump campaign spent $3.6 million on legal fees in March alone.\n\nIn March, Biden spent $29.2 million , compared with $6.3 million spent in February.\n\nA majority of the Biden campaign\u2019s spending was driven by large ad-buys after the State of the Union address, when Biden began his \u201cmonth of action\u201d travel to swing states.\n\nBiden\u2019s spending may be paying dividends. On March 1, Biden was trailing Trump by 2% in national polls and as of April 30, the two candidates are virtually tied.\n\nCongressional Outlook:\n\nPollsters and pundits have ever so slightly favored the Democrats to retake the House, while the Senate leans Republican with a very favorable GOP map. The combined national campaign committees of Republicans have raised $375 million, while the Democrats have raised $462 million.\n\nSenate: The amount raised for Senate Democratic candidates is $447 million and $273 million for the Republicans, a total of $734 million from both parties for 34 seats.\n\nCurrently, Democratic House candidates have cumulatively raised $528 million, and Republican candidates have raised $574 million.\n\nThe chart below displays each party\u2019s committee fundraising totals as well as their spending.\n\nSource: https://ballotpedia.org/Party_committee_fundraising,_2023-2024\n\nHouse and Senate Observations\n\nThe House majority will likely come down to 22 races rated as toss ups, and at this point, most political analysts believe it to be a coin flip. For an analysis and outlook on the races read here\n\nSeven seats in the Senate are rated as true \u201ctoss ups\u201d and the combined amount of money raised in those races likely will top $300 million. The toss-up seats, their fundraising, and their polling is outlined in the chart below.\n\nPolling in Senate seats is conducted less frequently than for the Presidential election, and while Democrats lead in those races, the margins are expected to tighten.\n\nHouse Fundraising\n\nWhat does this mean: The election to control the House and the Senate is going to be extremely close and any majority won by either party will likely only be by a handful of seats.\n\nPresidential Race : The race is currently a tie and will once again come down to seven states that were decided by margins of 3% or less in 2020.\n\nHouse and Senate : Both chambers will be controlled by a narrow majority, regardless of which party gains control.\n\n2024: This election will be the most expensive ever, and based on current polling is a toss-up at both the presidential and congressional level. Political spending continues to skyrocket cycle after cycle.\n\nIf you live in or near any of the seven swing states, you will almost certainly see and hear the results of all this fundraising this fall. Massive ad-buys are expected to surge after this summer\u2019s party nominating conventions.\n\nContact James Montfort (Jmonfort@crefc.org) with any questions.",

        "text": "Primary Election Types\nThe laws governing primary elections are complex. The following explains general information about primary elections at the local, state, and federal levels, as well as presidential primary elections. Different states and jurisdictions have different requirements to vote and participate in a primary election. To find out more about voting in your state, visit eac.gov/vote or contact your state or local election official.\n\nIn partisan contests, primaries are used to select which candidates will represent a political party in the general election. Nonpartisan primaries are used to narrow the field of candidates for a given office. In presidential primaries, voters are generally voting for party delegates, rather than for candidates themselves. Primary elections differ from caucuses, which also determine nominees for political parties but are party-run and subject to different rules than elections. Most primaries are administered by state and local election officials, although a political party may host and administer primaries in certain circumstances. The manner in which primaries are conducted varies by state.\n\nSpreadsheet of State Primary Types and Associated Election Laws\n\nNonpartisan Primaries\n\nNonpartisan primaries are elections where candidates run with no party affiliation on the ballot. If a candidate for nonpartisan office does not win with a certain threshold (typically 50%), then the candidates with the highest number of votes advance to a general or run-off election. In some states, nonpartisan contests and ballot issues may be included on the same ballot as partisan contests. In other states, partisan contests are on a separate ballot.\n\nImage\n\nOpen Partisan Primary & Open to Unaffiliated Voters\n\n44% of states have either an open partisan primary election or one that is open to unaffiliated voters. Open partisan primary elections generally allow all voters to participate, regardless of their political affiliation. Some states require voters to publicly declare their choice of party ballot at the polling place, after which the poll worker provides or activates the appropriate ballot. Other states allow the voters to make their choice of party ballot within the privacy of the voting booth.\n\nImage\n\nPartially Closed & Partially Open Partisan Primaries\n\n26% of states have either a partially closed or partially open partisan primary. In partially closed partisan primary elections, state parties decide whether they permit voters registered without a political party affiliation to participate in their primary elections. In partially open partisan primary elections, voters are generally allowed to vote for candidates with a different party than they are affiliated, but they must declare their party choice or their party selection may change their party affiliation.\n\nImage\n\nClosed Partisan Primary\n\n20% of states, as well as D.C. have a closed partisan primary. In general, closed partisan primary elections are elections in which only voters affiliated with the political party holding the primary are eligible to participate and voters receive a ballot listing only those candidates running for office for the nomination of the political party with which the voters are affiliated.\n\nImage\n\n\u201cMulti-Party\u201d Partisan Primaries & Other Primary Modes\n\n10% of states have other modes of holding their partisan primary elections that do not fit into open or closed categories. Some of these states have a \"top-two\" or \u201ctop-four\u201d partisan format, where all voters receive a ballot with all candidates, regardless of the party affiliation or the voters or candidates. The two or four candidates with the highest number of votes advance to the general election, even if they have the same party affiliation. Other states have unique rules for conducting their primary election.\n\n17-year-olds\n\nAlthough the federal voting age is 18, over 20 states allow citizens who are 17 but will be 18 by the general election to vote in primary elections. Some states allow 17-year-olds to participate in local and state primaries only, while other states allow 17-year-olds to also vote in congressional primaries. In addition, 17-year-olds may be allowed to vote in presidential primaries or caucuses, depending on state law and political party rules.",
