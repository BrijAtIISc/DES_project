        "text": "US election 2024: Where Biden and Trump stand on key issues\nUS election 2024: Where Biden and Trump stand on key issues\n\nGetty Images / Reuters\n\nAmerican voters will choose between re-electing Democratic President Joe Biden or his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump, to the White House. Here's a look at what they stand for and how their policy proposals compare on 10 key issues.\n\nEconomy\n\nThe economic policy of President Biden has its own name - Bidenomics - and involves building the economy, in his words, \"from the bottom up\". That means investing in infrastructure and manufacturing, clean energy and expanding job opportunities. The economic data shows strong growth and jobs creation under his leadership. But voters feel the pain of high inflation, especially food and petrol. Mr Trump has blamed his successor's big spending for inflation and vowed a return to an agenda of lower taxes and less regulations. He also says he will look to replace Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell, a man he appointed but now accuses of being too \"political\".\n\nImmigration\n\nPresident Biden's promise of a more humane approach on immigration saw him suspend or revoke several Trump-era border policies, lift the refugee admissions cap and expand humanitarian parole. But a massive surge in illegal immigration and ensuing public backlash has prompted the Democrat to shift in favour of more restrictive measures. He is expected to issue an executive order that would allow border officials to limit migrant arrivals and swiftly deport those who enter the US illegally. Mr Trump rallied his congressional allies to kill that bill, claiming it did not go far enough. He is promising, if re-elected, to revive first-term policies that will \"seal the border\" and to carry out \"the largest deportation operation\" in US history. The Republican has also pledged to end birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented migrants and to wage war on Mexican drug cartels.\n\nAbortion\n\nPresident Biden has painted his opponent as the \"architect\" of an assault on reproductive freedom, after a Supreme Court with three Trump-appointed justices overturned Roe v Wade, the landmark 1973 ruling that granted US women the constitutional right to an abortion. With several states moving to restrict abortion access, he is promising to restore the rights afforded by Roe as the law of the land if Democrats win back Congress. Mr Trump calls himself \"proudly the person responsible\" for ending Roe but at the same time has criticised extreme measures in states like Arizona and Alabama. After a muddled few months, he finally set out his position as supporting states' rights to determine their own laws. But he declined to show support for a national law or how many weeks in his view should be the limit.\n\nUkraine aid\n\nPresident Biden has repeatedly urged Congress to continue funding Ukraine, warning that a win for Russia's Vladimir Putin will endanger Europe and embolden another major US adversary - China. Mr Trump warned in February he would \"encourage\" Russia to \"do whatever the hell they want\" to Nato countries if those allies did not meet their financial obligations to the bloc - though he has since softened his rhetoric.\n\nIsrael/Gaza War\n\nPresident Biden remains \"rock solid\" in his support for Israel, providing billions of dollars worth in weapons and urging more aid to the US ally, but has ramped up public criticisms of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about his handling of the war in Gaza. Often boastful of his support for Israel, Mr Trump now says the country must \"finish what they started\" against Hamas militants in Gaza but \"get it over with fast\" because it is \"losing the PR war\".\n\nTaxes\n\nPresident Biden supports raising the corporate income tax rate to 28%, bringing it closer to the 35% rate that prevailed prior to Mr Trump's term. He has also proposed imposing higher tax rates on the wealthiest Americans, cracking down on tax avoidance, and expanding tax credits for low earners and families. He recently escalated Trump-imposed tariffs on China, including a 100 percent tax on its electric vehicles. Mr Trump is pledging across-the-board tax cuts if he returns to office, in part by prolonging soon-to-expire income tax cuts, along with estate and wealth tax breaks, from legislation he signed in 2017. He will maintain the corporate income tax rate at 21% and proposes a universal 10% tariff on all US imports, and a 60% tariff on imports from China.\n\nHealthcare\n\nPresident Biden and Democrats have taken action to lower prescription drugs costs for older people. As the \"Obamacare\" health insurance programme continues to grow in popularity, he has fought to protect and expand coverage, and lower costs, moves that have pushed enrolment to an all-time high. Mr Trump has often vowed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act with \"something better\", but failed to detail an alternative. He and his Republican Party are routinely fending off Democratic claims that he will chip away at the Social Security and Medicare safety nets for American seniors.\n\nCrime\n\nPresident Biden credits investment in public safety for the significant decline in violent crime after major spikes during the first two years of the pandemic. Recent FBI data shows there is a downward trend but many Americans, like those surveyed by Gallup a few months ago, feel that crime is rising. New York recently deployed its National Guard to patrol the city subway in response to a spike in transit crime. Mr Trump has often highlighted violent incidents involving migrants or singled out public safety concerns in Democratic-led cities to paint a picture of surging, out-of-control crime levels under his rival. He has called for the death penalty to be used on drug dealers.\n\nClimate\n\nPresident Biden invested a historic $300bn (\u00a3239bn) into clean energy and climate initiatives through his Inflation Reduction Act. He has also set ambitious new goals for cutting greenhouse gas and vehicle emissions, and spurred a boon in the green energy economy. But some climate activists oppose actions he has taken to boost oil and gas production, including the Willow oil project in Alaska. Mr Trump, by contrast, has again taken up the vow to \"drill, baby, drill\" and unleash domestic energy production, in part to bring prices at the pump down. Domestic production is, however, higher under Mr Biden. At a recent dinner with oil executives and lobbyists, the Republican promised to eliminate Mr Biden's new climate rules and environmental regulations if they donated $1bn to his campaign.\n\nGun laws\n\nPresident Biden signed into law the most significant gun safety legislation in more than two decades, which includes enhanced background checks for gun buyers and other protections. His justice department has also banned the manufacture and sale of \"ghost guns\". He has repeatedly urged Congress to pass a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Mr Trump weakened US gun laws in office, but also took action to ban bump stocks, the accessories that allow semi-automatic weapons to fire more quickly. Accepting the National Rifle Association's endorsement this month, he said he would unravel all of Mr Biden's new gun rules and fire the head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.",

        "text": "Students get a glimpse inside the American presidency, courtesy of White House officials\nRarely does a student get to watch an exclusively curated interview \u2014 produced just for their learning experience \u2014 with a former vice president of the United States.\n\nUniversity of Arizona students recently got that opportunity in a spring semester class focused on the American presidency.\n\nAs the U.S. prepares for this year's presidential election, students in spring session of the course Political Science 205: The American Presidency learned, through recorded interviews featuring bipartisan perspectives, about the role of the presidency and its intersection with civic discourse.\n\nThe American Presidency is an online, asynchronous class open to all students, and has attracted people from various time zones, with students logging in from cities such as Dubai, Madrid, Chicago and Tucson.\n\nThe course is offered in both the fall and spring. The spring course is taught by former White House spokesman and UArizona alumnus Pete Seat, an adjunct instructor in the School of Government and Public Policy in the College of Social and Behavioral Sciences, who conducted a series of recorded interviews with experts specifically for class.\n\nImage Clockwise from top left: Former Vice President Mike Pence; Mike Froman, president of the Council on Foreign Relations and former U.S. trade representative in the Obama administration; former White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten; former White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest; Kristen Welker, moderator of \"Meet the Press\u201d and former White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain.\n\nAmong the featured experts are former White House officials and staff, media personalities, a think-tank director and others from both sides of the aisle. They include former Vice President Mike Pence; former White House chiefs of staff Josh Bolten and Ron Klain; Mike Froman, president of the Council on Foreign Relations and former U.S. trade representative in the Obama administration; Kristen Welker, moderator of \"Meet the Press;\" and Shealah Craighead, former chief official White House photographer for the Trump administration.\n\nThrough the interviews, students learn things like how to craft a presidential speech, what considerations go into building a presidential cabinet, how to think like a political pundit, and what recommendations and suggestions a press secretary might give a president in various scenarios.\n\nStudents in the course learn about the role of the commander in chief, political strategies and governmental interactions, the history of the presidency and the electoral process, all of which Seat hopes gives them a clearer perspective of presidential expectations and responsibilities.\n\n\"I strongly feel that if we want to encourage civic participation, students need a connection to the real world and a practical application to help them understand the difficulty of making decisions in these roles,\" Seat said.\n\nWill Gibson, a political science major who took the class in the spring, said he enjoyed the guest interviews immensely.\n\n\"Professor Seat assembled a remarkable lineup, from a journalist to a chief of staff to a former vice president,\" Gibson said. \"These conversations focus on the triumph and the hardship, the daily life and the unexpected moments, the joy and the difficulty of working near the White House. Their perspectives on public service and civic engagement are so inspiring.\"\n\nNormal people with important jobs\n\nImage Pete Seat\n\nSeat, a vice president at Bose Public Affairs Group in Indianapolis, attended UArizona as an undergraduate theater major and graduated in 2005. His first job after college was working in the White House as a research assistant in the Office of Presidential Scheduling. As he worked his way up to deputy assistant press secretary, he realized the people working in the White House were just \"normal people who happen to have important jobs.\" He hopes to help students understand that as they learn about civic discourse.\n\nIn his recorded interview with Seat, former White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest, who served under President Barack Obama, discussed the open-door policy the president maintained. Earnest highlighted how this policy allowed him to easily access the president's thoughts or arrange rehearsals before briefings. The sense of familiarity Earnest had with the president was surprising to many students.\n\n\"In their discussion posts, students remarked how amazing this was,\" said Seat. \"They never thought a press secretary had this kind of access. One of my goals in this class is to help show that it's easy to watch elected officials and their staff on TV and lose sight of the fact that they aren't different from anyone else.\"\n\nChallenging assignments: Engagement and tough decisions\n\nIn one assignment, students were asked to write a letter to the editor of a newspaper, sharing their candidate preference for the 2024 presidential contest. Seat saw the exercise as a skill that will serve students later.\n\n\"To me, that's part of the civic engagement piece. I want them to be exposed to that process,\" he said. \"Hopefully, it inspires them to write a letter to the editor when there's an issue they care about down the road.\"\n\nAnother task required students to act as president and build their cabinet \u2013 choosing a vice president, secretary of state and other roles \u2013 and provide a rationale for their choices. Caleb Charlie, an undergraduate law major, aspires to run for president someday. The class helped him realize that, ultimately, the Commander-in-Chief carries the load, regardless of those who help make decisions.\n\n\"The presidency is an ever-changing role,\" Charlie said. \"There are always problems, concerns, issues and events happening that affect all Americans, but the president is always the one who takes responsibility for the outcome.\"\n\nSeat believes there are many ways to be civically engaged, whether in the community or politically. Ideally, students in the class will gain a \"deeper, more practical understanding of the process\" and become inspired to ask more questions, he said.\n\n\"The School of Government and Public Policy prides itself in offering rigorous and engaging courses that encourage students to be active in the public sphere. The American Presidency course is a perfect example,\" said Edella Schlager, the school's director. \"Civic engagement is critical for a vibrant democracy, and Pete Seat is providing students with multiple learning and outreach opportunities.\"\n\nOne student shared in an online post at the start of the course that she was taking the class because she was embarrassed by how little she knew about the presidency; she had gone her entire life not knowing the basic functions of the office and why it should matter to her.\n\nThat resonated with Seat, who tailored his class to put students like her as close as possible to the presidency without being in the White House.\n\n\"That's why I'm here, too,\" said Seat. \"For that very reason.\"",

        "text": "Time to Reset the U.S. Trade Agenda\nOver the past three years, U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan have worked to articulate a \u201cworker-centered\u201d trade policy while arguing for a \u201cnew Washington consensus\u201d in U.S. international economic policy that will foster global investment and cooperation on issues like climate and development.1 Tai, Sullivan, and other U.S. officials have succeeded in laying out a vision for American industrial policy, one that has attracted hundreds of billions of dollars of announced investment in U.S. computer chip manufacturing and clean energy technology. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also has popularized the concept of \u201cfriendshoring\u201d\u2014the idea that U.S. allies and partners can benefit as multinational corporations diversify away from China.2 This term first appeared in a 2021 White House report on supply chains.\n\nBut when it comes to the brass tacks of trade\u2014trade deals, tariff lines, the paperwork that companies have to file at the border, and other mechanics\u2014U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s administration has not articulated a coherent agenda. At times, the administration has tried to use the specter of China\u2019s economic threat to generate support for trade deals. One notable example is its signature Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), which is intended to strengthen economic relations between the United States and countries across the Pacific. But geopolitical arguments for deals are failing to carry the day. Last November, deep congressional skepticism and electoral concerns spurred the administration to indefinitely postpone the IPEF trade pillar, and it is unclear whether it will complete the work even after the 2024 election.\n\nWhen it comes to the brass tacks of trade\u2014trade deals, tariff lines, the paperwork that companies have to file at the border, and other mechanics\u2014U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s administration has not articulated a coherent agenda.\n\nFormer president Donald Trump, in his current campaign to return to the White House, does have a clear vision for trade: he has announced plans to deploy tariffs and other protectionist measures to support favored U.S. industries.3 The architect of Trump\u2019s trade policy between 2017 and early 2021, former U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer, has argued that the United States should vigorously deploy tariffs and other trade restrictions both to protect U.S. industry and to force not only China, but a variety of European and Asian countries, to cease unfair trade practices.4 However, a number of experts have raised concerns about the economic impacts of these policies as well as the risks they would pose to U.S. geopolitical relationships.5\n\nResetting America\u2019s trade agenda and developing a trade vision capable of drawing broad support across Washington is going to require the government to, as Steve Jobs would have said, \u201cthink different.\u201d Rather than treating trade deals as a geopolitical endeavor that the United States should suffer through to support America\u2019s allies and partners, or pursuing Trump\u2019s vision of simply reducing trade (the geopolitical argument), the United States should get back to a basic premise that has guided successful trade policy in the past\u2014that policymakers can develop and promote trade policies that advance American economic interests as well as American geopolitical interests.\n\nResetting America\u2019s trade agenda and developing a trade vision capable of drawing broad support across Washington is going to require the government to, as Steve Jobs would have said, \u201cthink different.\u201d\n\nGiven the nature of the economic challenges the United States currently faces, this approach will require policymakers to spend less time on the geopolitics and more time on the economics. That choice, in turn, will encourage a shift in the primary focus away from regional deals and toward narrower sectoral deals that address the problems of greatest concern to most Americans, such as climate, energy, and the looming artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. To actually solve those problems, the United States should be open to using a new set of tools in creating trade deals, including those related to financial instruments, development, and national security. Today\u2019s biggest challenges cannot be solved simply with market access and regulatory cooperation. The next chapter in American trade policy will need to entail new types of sectoral deals between the United States and key allies and partners on a set of issues that include climate and energy, supply chains, and AI and the digital economy.\n\nThe Rise of the Modern Trade Paradigm\n\nRebooting America\u2019s trade agenda first requires understanding why the protrade consensus that prevailed from the 1990s to the mid-2010s\u2014the most recent era of significant U.S. trade dealmaking\u2014broke down.\n\nSince the end of World War II, the United States has undertaken successful rounds of trade dealmaking during periods when trade deals had both a clear geopolitical and a clear economic logic. In the late 1940s, in the aftermath of the war, the deal that fit both U.S. geopolitical and economic interests was the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Geopolitically, American policymakers saw the GATT as a tool to shore up Western alliances in the nascent days of the Cold War.6 From an economic perspective, trade negotiators designed the GATT to be an antidote to prevent a return to the \u201cbeggar thy neighbor\u201d tariff policies of the 1930s, which postwar economists and policymakers saw as having exacerbated the Great Depression. The agreement required reductions in tariff rates and ensured that members accorded each other \u201cmost favored nation\u201d trading status to put further downward pressure on tariffs over time. From a U.S. perspective, American officials also understood the GATT as a tool to help open markets to U.S. goods at a time when the United States was the world\u2019s largest net exporter and needed foreign markets to replace war-driven demand for U.S. industry. Reductions in foreign tariffs on U.S. goods provided a major direct benefit for American industry.7\n\nSince the end of World War II, the United States has undertaken successful rounds of trade dealmaking during periods when trade deals had both a clear geopolitical and a clear economic logic.\n\nThe United States pushed to expand the GATT several times during the Cold War. The so-called Kennedy Round of 1964\u20131967 resulted in additional tariff reductions and began to establish disciplines around dumping, the practice where a country sells a product internationally at a lower price than the product sells for in its home market. The Tokyo Round of the 1970s expanded participation in the GATT to more than one hundred countries, seeking to include much of the nonaligned developing world. It began to try to tackle nontariff barriers and \u201cvoluntary export restraints,\u201d a type of measure where countries would agree to limit export quantities in exchange for avoiding tariffs. With the introduction of a Subsidies Code, the Tokyo Round also began to introduce the concept of rules around subsidies.\n\nHowever, the modern trade orthodoxy that guided U.S. trade policy from the end of the Cold War through the mid-2010s crystallized in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The fall of the Berlin Wall ushered in America\u2019s unipolar moment, when America\u2019s geopolitical policymakers saw an opportunity to use trade and economic relations to anchor its former Soviet adversaries and emerging geopolitical competitors, notably China, in a U.S.-led international order. Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and Bill Clinton, meanwhile, presided over a period of neoliberal economic consensus in Washington that Washington thought was an economic model appropriate for the world as well. Trade policy and trade deals (as well as other policy levers such as the International Monetary Fund) offered a tool to promote that U.S. economic model abroad. This intersection of geopolitics and economics ushered in a remarkably productive period of trade policymaking, with initiatives such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the World Trade Organization (WTO), and free trade agreements (FTAs) with more than a dozen nations. Other related policies included the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), which cut tariffs on imports from democratic countries in Africa in a bid to foster development and democratic progress on the continent.\n\nThe deals of this era had a clear geopolitical logic. NAFTA was designed to strengthen the North American political union and, in the eyes of both presidents Bush and Clinton, to provide an eventual pathway toward a more democratic and economically unified Western Hemisphere\u2014a vision that George H. W. Bush\u2019s son and later president George W. Bush, took further with the Central America\u2013Dominican Republic FTA (CAFTA-DR) a decade after NAFTA entered into force. The WTO, and China\u2019s ultimate accession to it at the end of the decade, reflected the prevailing 1990s geopolitical view that a global trading arrangement would help draw countries like China toward the West. As Clinton said of China\u2019s accession in 1999, \u201cit represents the most significant opportunity that we have had to create positive change in China since the 1970s,\u201d noting that China was \u201cagreeing to import one of democracy\u2019s most cherished values: economic freedom. The more China liberalizes its economy, the more fully it will liberate the potential of its people.\u201d8 Or, as George W. Bush said about U.S. legislation to enact the CAFTA-DR agreement, \u201cthis bill is more than a trade bill. This bill is a commitment of freedom-loving nations to advance peace and prosperity throughout the Western hemisphere.\u201d9\n\nFTAs with Morocco (2004), Bahrain (2005), and Oman (2006), enacted in the years following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, were intended to bolster American allies in the war against Islamic terrorism and with the aspiration that economic progress could reduce the terrorist threat. In a 2003 presidential speech, George W. Bush laid out his economic vision for the region, which proposed bilateral FTAs as stepping stones toward a Middle East Free Trade Area. As he remarked, \u201cacross the globe, free markets and trade have helped defeat poverty, and taught men and women the habits of liberty.\u201d10\n\nThe economic logic behind these deals was as important as the geopolitics. From a macroeconomic perspective, the trade deals of this era reflected a view that the U.S. economy could benefit from offshoring lower-value U.S. manufacturing in order to lower consumer costs, while encouraging the domestic growth of higher-value industries like software, healthcare, and value-added manufacturing. As Clinton put it in 1993, \u201cthis debate about NAFTA is a debate about whether we will embrace [economic] changes and create the jobs of tomorrow, or try to resist these changes, hoping we can preserve the economic structures of yesterday.\u201d11 Trade globalization was thought to create opportunities for new U.S. exports, encourage innovation by forcing companies to compete globally, and lower consumer costs. Furthering Clinton\u2019s argument in support of NAFTA and an aspirational Latin America free trade deal, policymakers also thought that an expanded U.S. trade block could deliver the economies of scale needed to compete with the emerging European Union trade block and growing intra-Asian regional trade.12\n\nWith the texts of the deals themselves, trade policymakers sought to promote the then-prevailing economic consensus in Washington, which championed reduced government subsidies; nondiscrimination for goods produced by other countries; lower regulatory burdens for business, including the then-nascent digital economy; and strong intellectual property (IP) protections. Policymakers also sought to promote higher labor and environmental standards and to tackle challenges like corruption. Senior figures in Washington often spoke of these goals as raising standards internationally and writing global rules based on U.S. rules.\n\nThe WTO\u2019s Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM Agreement), which went into effect in 1995, for example, drastically expanded the pre-WTO GATT\u2019s disciplines regarding industrial subsidies.13 Throughout the text of the WTO agreements and U.S. FTAs, countries agreed to accord \u201cnational treatment\u201d to each other\u2019s goods, committing not to give preference to domestically produced goods. In most U.S. FTAs, and with respect to the countries that have signed up to the WTO\u2019s Government Procurement Agreement, this nondiscrimination commitment even extended to government procurement of goods\u2014meaning that the U.S. government, for example, should not show a preference for U.S.-made cars over foreign cars when buying for the federal fleet.14 Of course, these agreements also required governments to allow U.S. companies to bid on their procurement contracts.15\n\nU.S. FTAs typically included chapters ensuring that FTA partners offered IP protections comparable to U.S. IP protections. Several also sought to codify legal immunity for digital platforms regarding content posted by their users, just as platforms have immunity in the United States from lawsuits over user-posted content. Free data flows generally were protected, and governments made other commitments to not limit the operations of digital platforms operating in their countries. Trade policymakers also regularly touted deal language that promoted workers\u2019 rights and environmental standards.16\n\nThe final chapter of this era of trade policymaking was President Barack Obama\u2019s support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a trade deal between a dozen economies in the Americas and Asia negotiated by the Obama administration in 2016. The TPP expanded on earlier FTAs from the 2000s and early 2010s, including by developing new disciplines on state-owned enterprises and currency manipulation.17 But the Obama administration made its case for the TPP largely on geopolitical grounds, arguing that it would be an important economic counterweight to China\u2019s influence in the Pacific and an economic pillar of the administration\u2019s \u201cpivot to China.\u201d18\n\nThe Modern Paradigm\u2019s Fall From Grace\n\nObama signed the TPP in January 2016. But even as he pushed for congressional ratification of the deal, it was becoming clear that the trade paradigm that had dominated Washington policy discussions since the early 1990s was falling out of favor. By late 2015, key congressional leaders had begun to express skepticism of the emerging TPP provisions, and ultimately they never scheduled a vote on the deal.19 Both of the major presidential candidates in 2016, Democrat Hillary Clinton (who had supported the early development of the TPP while serving as Obama\u2019s secretary of state) and Republican Donald Trump, opposed the deal on the campaign trail, and Trump withdrew the United States from the deal shortly after his inauguration in 2017. (The other members of the deal, led by Japan, moved forward and completed the deal, rebranded as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, in 2018.)\n\nObama signed the TPP in January 2016. But even as he pushed for congressional ratification of the deal, it was becoming clear that the trade paradigm that had dominated Washington policy discussions since the early 1990s was falling out of favor.\n\nAs president, Trump generally eschewed traditional trade deals in favor of a tariff-heavy approach to trade, intended to put pressure on China while protecting U.S. industries, like steel, that he deemed important. Nevertheless, he did successfully enact the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), an overhaul of the NAFTA agreement from twenty-five years earlier. And while some in the trade policy and national security communities hoped that Biden would launch negotiations to reenter the TPP, Biden has instead launched trade initiatives like the IPEF that are intended promote cooperation on trade and standards but do not provide access to the U.S. market as traditional FTAs would. And even without U.S. market access, such initiatives have proved politically controversial. In November 2023, for instance, Biden indefinitely postponed finalization of the trade-related aspects of IPEF owing to concerns by Democrats in Congress that the deal would be politically harmful and due to opposition by American labor unions.20 Biden also quietly postponed nascent trade talks with the United Kingdom and Kenya that began in the last months of the Trump administration, and late last year his trade representative, Katherine Tai, withdrew long-standing U.S. support for proposed digital trade rules at the WTO. Trump, in his campaign to regain the presidency this year, has doubled down on his commitment to tariffs and other protectionist measures rather than deals, floating the idea of imposing a 60 percent tariff on goods imported from China and a 10 percent tariff on products imported from everywhere else.21\n\nOf course, trade has long been a hot-button political issue. Texas billionaire H. Ross Perot made his opposition to NAFTA a signature issue in his 1992 independent presidential campaign against Bill Clinton and incumbent George H. W. Bush, and trade deal approvals have always been hard fought in Congress. But for the twenty-five-year period between 1990 and the mid-2010s, geopolitical and economic logic were able to overcome that political opposition to see deals to fruition. Today, there is scant evidence that new trade deals could get through Congress, and a dwindling number of elected political leaders are willing to argue in favor of them. There are several reasons for this change in political support.\n\nTrade has long been a hot-button political issue. Texas billionaire H. Ross Perot made his opposition to NAFTA a signature issue in his 1992 independent presidential campaign against Bill Clinton and incumbent George H. W. Bush, and trade deal approvals have always been hard fought in Congress.\n\nThe first is the shifting U.S. relationship with China. Although economic research from the 1990s and early 2000s generally found that expanding U.S. trade flows had at most a limited impact on U.S. manufacturing employment, with other factors such as automation playing a larger role, research from the mid- and late 2010s found that the \u201cChina shock\u201d of growing U.S.-China trade in the 2000s had substantially more disruptive impacts on jobs.22 Moreover, communities adversely impacted by the China shock have seen little recovery over the past decade.23 Adverse employment impacts from trade with China, combined with China\u2019s rise as a geopolitical competitor, have led to bipartisan support for \u201cderisking\u201d U.S. supply chains from China, fueled the arguments of trade skeptics, and renewed a focus on U.S. domestic manufacturing.\n\nThe second reason is shifts in domestic political preferences. It is true that some polling shows that the majority of Americans are supportive of trade: a 2023 poll commissioned by the Chicago Council for Global Affairs, for example, found that 74 percent of Americans say \u201ctrade is good for the U.S. economy.\u201d24 But as prominent economist Alan Blinder pointed out several years ago in Foreign Affairs, \u201cmost Americans\u2019 belief in free trade is a mile wide but an inch deep,\u201d with polling responses varying widely depending on which questions are being asked and whether Americans are asked only about trade in the abstract or also about American manufacturing and jobs.25\n\nTrade policy is a classic example of an issue where a constituency that is invested deeply in and affected by an issue, such as specific U.S. industries and workers who face the risk of losses from trade, exert more influence than a majority of voters who may benefit from lower prices but who do not see their well-being as being deeply connected to trade issues. Recent polling by American Compass, a conservative organization that is skeptical of trade deals, has also shown that while a plurality of Americans thinks they personally benefit from globalization, a similar plurality thinks the United States as a whole has been harmed.26 Other recent polling suggests that on trade, more Americans trust Trump, with his zeal for tariffs, than trust Biden.27 Academic research, meanwhile, indicates that while Trump\u2019s tariffs were an economic mixed bag, they won Republicans votes at the ballot box.28\n\nA third reason is that the raw economic benefits of trade deals have become less compelling. Take the TPP as an example: even the Obama administration\u2019s own official estimate found that the TPP would add just 0.15 percent to U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) after a decade, hardly a compelling economic justification for the deal.29 And in the years since Trump abandoned the deal, actual U.S. trade flows have still moved in a beneficial direction: China\u2019s share of U.S. goods imports declined from a high of over 20 percent in the late 2010s to approximately 15 percent last year, while the absolute value of U.S. goods imports from China fell last year to the lowest level in a decade.30 Trade with allies and partners also has grown: since 2017, U.S imports of goods from India are up 37 percent, up 80 percent from Indonesia, up 61 percent from the Philippines, and up a whopping 200 percent from Vietnam\u2014the last of these now exports goods valued at a quarter of its entire GDP to the United States. The United States became India\u2019s largest trading partner in 2023, while U.S. exports to the European Union and European imports from the United States are both up more than 25 percent over the past few years.31 Overall U.S. exports today substantially exceed prepandemic levels, reflecting growing global demand for U.S. energy, agriculture, and manufactured goods, as well as U.S. services.\n\nMeanwhile, Americans traditionally thought to be adversely impacted by trade are doing well. Real wages for lower-income Americans grew strongly in 2023, and, in a reversal of the trend that has prevailed for most of the past two decades, the real wage growth for lower-income Americans over the past two years has been higher than the rate of wage growth for higher-income Americans.32 Women and Black Americans also saw historic gains in the labor market.33 A situation where both U.S. companies and U.S. workers are doing well creates little incentive to open U.S. markets to more competition. Numbers like these reinforce skepticism about the benefits of new FTAs.\n\nAmericans traditionally thought to be adversely impacted by trade are doing well. Real wages for lower-income Americans grew strongly in 2023.\n\nBut perhaps the most important reason for declining U.S. political support for new trade deals is that the economic theory of the case that underpinned the deals of the 1990s to the mid-2010s has fallen out of favor in Washington. At a fundamental level, a bipartisan consensus has emerged in Washington that the United States should rebuild its manufacturing industrial base and focus more on the economic well-being of American workers. Irrespective of whether prioritizing manufacturing optimizes American economic growth, there is strong political support for doing so.\n\nIn some sectors, U.S. domestic support for reindustrialization is driven by geopolitics: Congress\u2019s bipartisan support for the CHIPS Act in 2022, which will provide more than $75 billion in incentives for manufacturing semiconductors in the United States, was driven in part by concern that a conflict between China and Taiwan could cut off America\u2019s access to the chips it needs for industrial, defense, and consumer applications. In other sectors, such as manufacturing clean energy technologies, the push for reindustrialization is driven by a combination of geopolitical desires\u2014ensuring that the United States is not dependent on China for green technologies\u2014as well as domestic economic interests in boosting manufacturing employment in emerging manufacturing sectors. Across the political aisle, Biden\u2019s trade representative Katherine Tai and Trump\u2019s former trade representative Robert Lighthizer are united in a view that a goal of trade policy should be to raise wages and well-being for workers and that, for too long, trade policy has focused on benefits to consumers.\n\nAt a macroeconomic level, this desire to reindustrialize in many respects runs counter to the economic theory that underpinned many of the major trade deals of the past, which posited that U.S. workers would move up into \u201chigher value\u201d sectors like information technology, healthcare, and advanced manufacturing as the United States offshored lower-value (and lower profit margin) types of manufacturing. Moreover, many of the tools that policymakers want to deploy to rebuild manufacturing may run up against the trade rules that the United States long supported. Many of the United States\u2019 European and Asian allies, for example, argue that the manufacturing subsidies the United States adopted in the CHIPS Act and particularly the green energy\u2013focused Inflation Reduction Act violate the spirit and likely the letter of provisions of the WTO and U.S. trade agreements that long sought to limit industrial subsidies or at least give countries the right to retaliate against them.34 Likewise, \u201cBuy America\u201d provisions that direct the U.S. government to purchase American-made products run counter to trade rules on government procurement long supported by the United States.\n\nThe United States confronts a similar dynamic with respect to policymakers\u2019 preferences on technology and the digital economy. Going back to the early days of the internet and continuing through the 2019 U.S.-Japan digital agreement, U.S. trade agreements have sought to promote light-touch regulation of the tech sector, guarantee the free flow of data across borders, and protect tech companies from lawsuits for content posted online. Today, Democrats and Republicans alike are pursuing a much more aggressive regulatory approach to technology companies, including competition policy crackdowns, efforts to repeal companies\u2019 immunity for content posted online, and increased restrictions on cross-border data flows, at least to China. Some members of Congress and policy experts in the United States even want to revisit long-standing patent and copyright protections\u2014such as the Biden administration\u2019s current consideration of exercising \u201cmarch in rights\u201d to override patents to reduce drug costs\u2014arguing that U.S. law has become too protective of intellectual property.35 The rise of generative AI is also likely to prompt a profound reassessment of intellectual property protections. These shifting domestic preferences, much like America\u2019s growing preference for industrial policy, in many ways run counter to provisions historically supported in U.S. trade deals and will require a reassessment and overhaul of the trade rules America pushes for.\n\nHow to Reset the Agenda\n\nFaced with fading support for FTAs, over the past two years trade-focused experts, industry lobbies, and protrade officials in Washington have floated a number of ways to reboot support for trade deals. The most popular approach has been to lean heavily on geopolitical arguments for trade. Commentators and political figures from across the political spectrum have argued that geopolitical competition with China makes trade deals with allies important: a late 2023 report by the bipartisan U.S. House of Representatives Select Committee on China, for example, argued that to compete with China the United States should \u201cpursue trade agreements with strong rules of origin and high standards,\u201d and it suggested Taiwan and possibly the United Kingdom and Japan as partners.36 As the Washington Post put it more succinctly in the title of a 2023 editorial, \u201cTo compete with China, the U.S. should put real trade deals on the table.\u201d37\n\nGeopolitics has been the driving argument for the Biden administration\u2019s IPEF. As Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said at a 2022 launch event, the IPEF \u201cmarks an important turning point in restoring U.S. economic leadership in the region and presenting Indo-Pacific countries an alternative to China\u2019s approach to these critical issues.\u201d38 Commentators such as Matthias Dopfner, meanwhile, have argued that Western democratic states should create a democratic trading block that increasingly would align trade policy with values while establishing the type of large economic scale that drives the efficiency gains that have been a long-standing economic argument for trade.39\n\nThe idea of a broad democratic trading bloc is appealing as a long-term vision. But there is little reason to expect that geopolitical arguments for trade will prevail in the debate\u2014particularly after they failed both to gain support for the TPP and to prevent Biden from postponing the IPEF trade pillar. The political and policy reality is that, aside from America\u2019s robust defense budget, Americans are wary of policies that they perceive as requiring the American taxpayer to pay for the benefit of even other democratic states, as evidenced by the comparatively low levels of U.S. foreign assistance, and, more recently, the sharp congressional debate over continuing U.S. military and economic support to Ukraine.40 Framing trade deals as a sort of tax the United States should pay to strengthen the democratic world against China and other autocracies is unlikely to be a winning argument in the American heartland without a healthy dose of economic self-interest thrown in as well. Moreover, a number of large emerging market democracies that would be an important part of a democratic trading block, such as India and Brazil, have traditionally pursued protectionists trade policies and seem unlikely to be interested in a broad market liberalization in the near or mid-term.\n\nThe idea of a broad democratic trading bloc is appealing as a long-term vision. But there is little reason to expect that geopolitical arguments for trade will prevail in the debate.\n\nA handful of former officials, seeing the political success of the USMCA\u2014Trump\u2019s updated NAFTA\u2014have argued that the new agreement could be expanded to add additional members, potentially ultimately countries on both sides of the Pacific.41 But here, too, both the politics and the policies likely would prove challenging. Although there was broad bipartisan support for USMCA, that support reflected the fact that the United States already had a trade deal with Mexico and Canada (NAFTA) and bipartisan recognition that after twenty-five years, elements of NAFTA were in need of an update. Adding more countries, which would de facto result in the United States entering into new agreements with countries that did not have preexisting FTAs, would carry a different and almost certainly more challenging set of political dynamics. Instead, the way to reset the trade agenda is to start by resetting the economic logic of deals. If successful periods of trade policymaking have occurred in the past when the United States saw deals as advancing both its economic and its geopolitical interests, policymakers need deals that work on the economics as well as the geopolitics.\n\nTo reset the economics, policymakers should start by thinking less about traditional goals of market liberalization and more about discrete global challenges that require international economic cooperation\u2014and possible ways of using trade deals to address those challenges. This would almost certainly mean pivoting from a bilateral or regional approach to trade to a sectoral approach to trade that brings together different sets of international partners to address discrete challenges.\n\nTo reset the economics, policymakers should start by thinking less about traditional goals of market liberalization and more about discrete global challenges that require international economic cooperation.\n\nStart with climate and energy. Global climate change poses an existential threat, as carbon dioxide emissions hit a new global high in 2023 despite years of international promises to address the problem.42 The United States accounts for only about 15 percent of total global emissions, whereas traded goods and services account for perhaps 25 percent of global emissions.43 Trade policy offers a powerful tool to tackle the 85 percent of emissions that originate outside the United States. Meanwhile, many U.S. allies and partners face a near-term challenge of securing their supplies of traditional fossil fuel energy, particularly following Russia\u2019s 2022 war on Ukraine. European allies, for example, have had to scramble to find substitutes for Russian oil and gas. Even the United States remains far too dependent on Russia for uranium for nuclear power.44\n\nA climate and energy agreement could bring together a group of countries with the technologies and critical materials needed to produce clean energy, such as South Korea on battery technology, Indonesia for critical minerals, and the European Union for its role in clean power. The countries could work together to coordinate clean energy supply chains and industrial policies to promote the adoption and manufacturing of clean energy technologies. They also could commit to technological cooperation on clean energy technologies, with members, for example, offering streamlined permitting for nuclear energy construction from other member states. As with any trade deal, there would be an economic give and take: the United States and Europe, for instance, could offer countries access to incentives for green energy manufacturing in exchange for reliable access to critical inputs produced with high environmental and labor standards.\n\nA climate and energy agreement could bring together a group of countries with the technologies and critical materials needed to produce clean energy.\n\nMeanwhile, the United States and Canada, major producers of traditional fossil fuels, could commit to providing access to fuels such as liquefied natural gas to address near-term energy security needs while the green transition is underway. The United States also could commit to maintaining high tariffs on Chinese clean energy technologies, including Chinese clean energy technologies produced in third countries, leveraging supply chain diversification away from China as an incentive for participation. It might also make efforts to lean heavily on the European Union and other allies to agree to impose similar tariffs on their imports of green energy products, such as electric vehicles (EVs), from China.\n\nConversely, countries could coordinate so-called carbon border adjustment mechanisms, which impose tariffs on products based on their carbon emissions, to put pressure on nonmember states like China and other highly polluting countries to reduce their emissions as well. Indeed, the United States and Europe are already discussing miniature versions of coordinated trade action for the clean economy. The proposed Global Arrangement for Sustainable Steel and Aluminum would promote trade in low-carbon steel and aluminum products, and proposed agreements on critical minerals would offer foreign battery materials makers some access to U.S. Inflation Reduction Act subsidies.45 These nascent steps could be bolstered and expanded into a compelling agenda.\n\nA second sectoral area for trade policy focus would be to develop an \u201ceconomic security\u201d arrangement that coordinated industrial policy measures while strengthening supply chains for critical products. Countries such as Germany and Japan have joined the United States in pursuing new industrial policy measures, as in the case of the European CHIPS Act, which provides incentives for semiconductor manufacturing in Europe to match the U.S. version.46 Although this approach is welcome, in that it will likely spur further global production of important products like green technologies and semiconductors, poorly coordinated industrial policy measures risk triggering global subsidy fights and creating incentives for companies to play governments off against one another in a bid to maximize subsidies beyond those strictly needed to spur a project.\n\nMeanwhile, the United States continues to face significant supply chain risks for other key products, such as medical devices and pharmaceutical ingredients. The production of many pharmaceuticals ingredients and some medical devices is concentrated on China and India. The United States, Europe, Israel, and a number of other countries, however, have a strong interest in resilience. An economic security arrangement could enable like-minded countries to coordinate industrial policy measures and promote supply chain resilience across critical products.\n\nAn economic security arrangement could enable like-minded countries to coordinate industrial policy measures and promote supply chain resilience across critical products.\n\nA final area for a sectoral agreement is AI and the digital economy. The United States has already begun to promote shared global standards for AI development through the G7\u2019s Hiroshima process.47 Over time, an AI and digital economy agreement could link G7 political agreements into binding commitments for a larger number of countries to adopt. With respect to the digital economy, such agreements could establish shared standards and rules of managing data flows to strategic competitors, notably China, to prohibitions on government review of source code for apps and software developed in participating countries and expanded access to the digital economy and trusted telecommunications network infrastructure.\n\nSectoral agreements also would let the United States reconceptualize the tools that are included in a trade agreement. Since the first modern FTA in the 1980s, American trade agreements have focused on reducing tariffs and aligning regulations, generally around American standards. But trade\u2014the actual exchange of goods and services and the associated economic activity\u2014depends at least as much on policies and tools outside the scope of these FTAs as it does on FTA provisions: effective infrastructure, streamlined permitting processes, access to capital, and a skilled workforce. It is time for the United States to open the aperture of what a trade agreement can include to bring in a larger set of tools and potential commitments. For example, an AI and digital economy agreement should not be limited to governance and regulatory standards\u2014it also should include meaningful financial commitments to help developing-world partner countries procure secure Western telecommunications equipment, rather than relying on Chinese suppliers. Similarly, a climate and energy agreement should include commitments to work together on streamlining the permitting process for high-priority projects that require a footprint across participating countries.\n\nNational security tools should also be on the table. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) and export controls have come to play a far more prominent role in the international economy in recent years. Here, the United States should use trade deals in an offensive rather than defensive manner, for example, using trade deals to lock in commitments by foreign governments to restrict Chinese acquisitions of strategic companies in their countries. But the United States should also use its own national security tools as an incentive. A climate and energy agreement, for example, should promise to whitelist reputable automotive companies from allied nations like Japan for streamlined CFIUS approval, ensuring that they can invest in promising EV and autonomous driving companies in the United States. A digital economy agreement could include commitments not to impose export controls on allies without advance notice and consultation.\n\nFinally, sectoral deals will let the United States focus trade provisions on specific facilities, rather than country of production. When the Trump administration negotiated the USMCA, for example, it included novel provisions that required workers to be paid at least $16 an hour for automotive parts to qualify for USMCA tariff treatment\u2014essentially meaning that only certain Mexican plants qualify. Sectoral trade agreements are well suited to take this type of approach: a climate and energy agreement, for example, could offer foreign-made electric parts access to some of the subsidies contained in the Inflation Reduction Act, but only for facilities that meet the highest labor and environmental standards.\n\nSectoral agreements also offer a new set of opportunities\u2014to reframe trade deals as solving tangible problems that matter to the American people and to the world at large, and to negotiate rules that would internationalize some domestic policy changes within the United States.\n\nNegotiating large sectoral agreements undoubtedly will be challenging, as countries argue over the scope of covered sectors, market access, and the commitments to put on the table. But sectoral agreements also offer a new set of opportunities\u2014to reframe trade deals as solving tangible problems that matter to the American people and to the world at large, and to negotiate rules that would internationalize some domestic policy changes within the United States.\n\nAddressing China\u2014and Whither the WTO?\n\nOf course, a rebooted U.S. trade agenda is not just about deals with allies\u2014it also requires addressing the U.S. trade relationship with China.\n\nFor many years, the strategic paradigm of U.S. trade policy toward China was defined by the hope that economic ties would persuade China to continue on a course of gradual economic and political liberalization. By the mid-2010s, it was clear that this paradigm had failed, prompting Trump to impose sweeping tariffs in a bid to generate negotiating leverage to compel China to change its economic model. China responded to the tariffs, initially with retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports like agricultural products, and ultimately Trump offered tens of billions of dollars in assistance to U.S. farmers to offset the impacts of Chinese tariffs.48 Later, China offered a handful of concessions as part of a \u201cPhase 1\u201d trade deal, largely to avoid a threatened future tariff escalation. However, China steadfastly refused to make more fundamental changes to its economy and market, and there is no evidence that China\u2019s willingness to reform has increased in the years since.\n\nMoreover, even in the unlikely event that China made additional trade concessions to the United States, it is far from clear that they should be accepted: the United States has a strategic interest in reducing its dependencies on China in critical goods irrespective of whether China offers better terms on trade. For example, even if China somehow offered to allow American firms to produce critical minerals or EV batteries in China on fair terms, the United States has a strategic interest in ensuring that its domestic markets are not reliant on those supplies. The United States of course should pursue appropriate, fair terms for trade in nonstrategic goods, but when it comes to critical products, the U.S. objective should be to derisk the relationship, not for American and Chinese firms to compete on a level playing field.\n\nEven in the unlikely event that China made additional trade concessions to the United States, it is far from clear that they should be accepted.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, the United States should rebalance its China tariffs to prioritize derisking rather than leverage for a deal. For example, it should raise tariffs on products where supply chain vulnerabilities remain acute, like EVs, batteries, medicines, and critical materials, while potentially offering some reductions in tariffs on nonstrategic consumer goods.\n\nEffective derisking will require more than simple tariffs on China, however: it also will require measures to reduce the Chinese content in imports from third countries. There is a growing body of evidence, for example, that some of America\u2019s growing imports from Vietnam are of products composed mostly of Chinese components, with low-value finishing work done in Vietnam. The United States needs to revisit the so-called rules of origin that determine what a product\u2019s country of origin is for tariff purposes to begin derisking the upstream elements of critical supply chains. It also needs to figure out how to tackle China\u2019s dominance in a handful of strategic construction industries, like shipbuilding and port infrastructure, where China\u2019s impacts are global.\n\nThough a U.S. pivot to sectoral agreements and more active management of the U.S.-China trade relationship could offer the potential to reboot the U.S. trade agenda, it will draw even more questions from U.S. allies about whether the United States has any residual support for the WTO. The WTO still serves as a basic framework for trade between nearly 200 countries, but the simple, often unspoken reality is that many American policymakers today regard the WTO as an outdated institution that reflects a different geopolitical moment. One of the WTO\u2019s core tenets is that countries would accord each other preferential \u201cmost favored nation\u201d trade status, in that the United States would set similar tariffs for both competitors like China and allies like Germany. With the resurrection of great power geopolitics as a defining feature of international relations, for most American policymakers it makes little sense for the United States to promote a global trading regime. Instead, most U.S. policymakers would prefer to see the development of a U.S.-centered trading bloc or blocs among allies and partners.\n\nThat said, most of America\u2019s allies remain committed to the WTO, for understandable reasons. As the world\u2019s largest economy, the United States is relatively well-positioned to negotiate bilateral or plurilateral agreements with major trading partners. Most small and midsize countries, however, strongly benefit from a stable global trading system rather than having to negotiate hundreds of bespoke agreements. The WTO also offers smaller countries a set of rules they see as being a valuable check on both the protectionist actions of large countries and for smaller countries to manage trade among themselves. The WTO itself, meanwhile, requires consensus for major changes, making reform unlikely. Moreover, a U.S. withdrawal from the WTO would be costly. It would result in more than one hundred countries around the world having the right to impose higher tariffs on the United States. To avoid that outcome, the United States would have to negotiate an unmanageable number of new deals in a short time frame.\n\nThe WTO also offers smaller countries a set of rules they see as being a valuable check on both the protectionist actions of large countries and for smaller countries to manage trade among themselves.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no clear path forward to resolve global differences on the WTO, given differences of both interest and opinion between the United States and its partners. The simplest path is likely for the United States and China, or perhaps the G7 on one side and China on the other, to reach a kind of mutual detente in which WTO rules would not actually govern trade between them. In many ways, this scenario would simply codify and expand the existing de facto reality between Washington and Beijing, where both Trump\u2019s 2018 tariffs on China and China\u2019s retaliation violate WTO rules, but the two governments effectively have reached a mutual understanding on tariff rates that simply exist outside the WTO system. Over the longer term, however, the world may see global trade continue to move toward discrete blocs\u2014and this trend is already well underway.49 But there is not yet any international consensus on what a vision for that future would look like.\n\nConclusion: Does Trade Policy Matter?\n\nOf course, for many Americans, and many policymakers, a rational lesson of the past few years could be that American trade policy does not need a reboot. Supply chains are diversifying away from China, U.S. exports are up, and real wages for workers are rising. Even if allies and partners complain about the lack of new American trade deals, rising actual trade volumes and closer defense relationships, like the AUKUS nuclear submarine deal with Australia and the UK and closer U.S. military cooperation with the Philippines, help to strengthen geopolitical ties. And even policymakers who want to use trade deals to strengthen geopolitical relations have to acknowledge that the correlation between economic and geopolitical relations is far from perfect. After all, Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 despite decades of European policy aimed at using trade to anchor Russia economically into the West. As Lighthizer told a House committee last year, the iconic rock band the Beatles taught him that \u201cmoney can\u2019t buy me love\u201d and that he doubted that \u201ctransferring our wealth to these people is going to make them like us more.\u201d50\n\nThe best argument is that trade is a key element of solving global challenges that affect us all, like the green energy transition and the risks of AI and the digital economy.\n\nThe strongest argument for rebooting U.S. trade policy ultimately may not be geopolitics, nor even the economic argument that trade deals will help an already-strong U.S economy. Instead, the best argument is that trade is a key element of solving global challenges that affect us all, like the green energy transition and the risks of AI and the digital economy. For trade policy to advance those goals, and win the domestic support that will be needed to make them happen, it is time to develop a trade policy designed around them.\n\nNotes\n\n1 Katherine Tai, \u201cRemarks of Ambassador Katherine Tai Outlining the Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s \u2018Worker-Centered Trade Policy,\u2019\u201d Office of the United States Trade Representative, June 2021, https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/speeches-and-remarks/2021/june/remarks-ambassador-katherine-tai-outlining-biden-harris-administrations-worker-centered-trade-policy; Jake Sullivan, \u201cRemarks by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on Renewing American Economic Leadership at the Brookings Institution,\u201d White House, April 27, 2023, https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/04/27/remarks-by-national-security-advisor-jake-sullivan-on-renewing-american-economic-leadership-at-the-brookings-institution/.\n\n2 See, for example, Janet Yellen, \u201cRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L.

        "text": "2024 presidential election could come down to independents, but what do they want?\nBOSTON - If history is any guide, the key to victory in the November election will be winning the independent vote.\n\nSo what is the mood of independents right now, and how is it different from the electorate at large?\n\nWho are the independents?\n\nThey're the ones who make the difference, the 43% of U.S. voters who identify as independents, compared with just 27% each who say they're Democrats or Republicans.\n\nWhy do they shun the two major parties? According to the new Harvard Center for American Political Studies/Harris poll, they really don't like partisanship and extremism.\n\nFor instance, among all voters, favorable views of the Supreme Court outdrew unfavorable opinions by 13 points. But it was the opposite among independents: 10 points more negative than positive about the court. Fallout from the overturning of Roe v. Wade? The poll doesn't make that clear, but it's likely part of what's rubbing independents the wrong way.\n\nWhat do independents want?\n\nThey like their institutions non-partisan, including Cable TV news.\n\nLeft-leaning MSNBC scored seven points less favorably among these voters than in the poll pool at large. For right-leaning Fox News, the gap was a whopping 21 points.\n\nAnd politicians who come off as ideologically extreme don't sell well with the independents.\n\nA recent poll shows how independents differ from Democrats and Republicans. CBS Boston\n\n\n\nTrump-aligned MAGA Republicans are underwater with all voters by 3%, by 18% with this crucial voter group. Left-wing icon Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez? Independents are nearly twice as likely to have an unfavorable take on her.\n\nAnd the major-party candidates? Indie voters broke for Biden in 2020, but this poll has him underwater by 15 points with them this time around, worse than his poor overall favorability.\n\nBut Trump has work to do here, as well: His unfavorable rating with this crucial voter group isn't much better than Biden's.\n\nWhat's the key to winning over these voters in the fall?\n\nNext time you hear Biden or Trump giving their pitch, take note of how hard they both work to paint the other side as \"extreme.\" That is a word that really turns off independents, and making it stick to your opponent is a crucial step for either side.\n\nAnd you'd better have a good plan for reaching them directly through targeted advertising or direct outreach on the ground. If they watch the party conventions at all, it will be with severe skepticism.",

He is expected to issue an executive order that would allow border officials to limit migrant arrivals and swiftly deport those who enter the US illegally.\n\nMr Trump rallied his congressional allies to kill that bill, claiming it did not go far enough. He is promising, if re-elected, to revive first-term policies that will \"seal the border\" and to carry out \"the largest deportation operation\" in US history.

        "text": "2024 Taiwanese presidential election\nPresidential elections were held in Taiwan on 13 January 2024 as part of the 2024 general elections.[1][2] Tsai Ing-wen of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), the incumbent president of the Republic of China, was ineligible for reelection due to term limits. As such, the DPP nominated Vice President Lai Ching-te, who had secured the party chairmanship by acclamation in March 2023. He selected Hsiao Bi-khim, a former US citizen and the then Representative to the United States, as his running mate. Lai was elected president with a plurality of 40.05% and was inaugurated on 20 May 2024.[3][4][5][6]\n\nThe opposition Kuomintang (KMT) nominated the incumbent New Taipei mayor Hou Yu-ih as their candidate for president in May 2023. In November, Hou chose the former Legislative Yuan member Jaw Shaw-kong to be his running mate. The Taiwan People's Party (TPP) nominated Ko Wen-je, its leader, the former Mayor of Taipei, who in turn chose Legislative Yuan member Cynthia Wu as his running mate. Despite previously saying he would support Hou's nomination, businessman Terry Gou declared his own independent bid in September 2023, before ultimately dropping out in November. Although the KMT and TPP had initially agreed to field a joint ticket in November 2023, the two sides were unable to reach a final agreement, and each announced their own vice presidential candidate on the last day of registration.\n\nThis presidential election had a turnout rate of 71.86%, which was a 3.04% reduction from the 2020 election. This marked the first time since the 2000 election that the winning candidate obtained less than 50% of the vote, and the first time that a party won more than two consecutive presidential elections since direct elections were introduced in 1996.\n\nBackground [ edit ]\n\nTsai Ing-wen, the incumbent President of the Republic of China (Taiwan), was ineligible to seek re-election after serving two terms.\n\nTsai Ing-wen of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) became the first female president after winning the 2016 presidential election, defeating KMT nominee Eric Chu. She won a second term in 2020 and continued to serve until 20 May 2024.[7] Tsai resigned as party chairperson after the DPP suffered losses in the 2022 Taiwanese local elections. She was replaced in an acting capacity by Chen Chi-mai.[8] Tsai's Vice President Lai Ching-te ultimately became the party chairperson by acclamation in late 2022.[9]\n\nQualifications and procedure [ edit ]\n\nPresidential and vice presidential candidates are elected on the same ticket using first-past-the-post voting. This will be the eighth direct election of the president and vice president, the posts having previously been indirectly elected by the National Assembly until 1996. According to the constitution, Tsai, having served two terms, is term-limited from office. Under Article 22 of the Presidential and Vice Presidential Election and Recall Act, only the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), Kuomintang (KMT), Taiwan People's Party (TPP), and New Power Party (NPP), having received more than five percent of the total vote in either the last presidential or legislative election, are eligible to contest the election.[citation needed]\n\nCandidates register with the Central Election Commission. Under Article 23, independent candidates and smaller parties are also eligible to contest, registering as the candidates for president and Vice President by the way of joint signature shall, within five days after the public notice for election is issued, apply to the Central Election Commission to be the presentees recommended by way of joint signature and to receive a list of joint signers, and pay a deposit of NT$1,000,000. If the number of joint signers reaches 1.5% of the total electors in the latest Presidential and Vice Presidential Election within the time limit, which is 45 days under normal circumstances or 25 days in case of a by-election or a reelection, the presentees will be allowed to proceed with contesting in the election after the joint signature documents are examined.[10] For the 2024 presidential election, the number of signatures required for independent candidates was approximately 290,000.[11] The complete petition was to be submitted between 13 and 17 September 2023, and the signature collection period followed from 17 September to 2 November 2023.[12] Presidential candidacies were formally registered between 20 and 24 November 2023.[13] Lots for ballot positioning were drawn on 11 December; the Taiwan People's Party ticket was to be listed first, followed by the Democratic Progressive Party, then the Kuomintang.[14]\n\nTimetable [ edit ]\n\nNominations [ edit ]\n\nDemocratic Progressive Party [ edit ]\n\nIncumbent president, two-time Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential nominee, and former Chair of the DPP Tsai Ing-wen is ineligible to run, having completed two consecutive terms. Tsai resigned as DPP Chair in 2022, following the party's poor performance in the local elections of that year.[21] After Tsai's resignation, Vice President Lai Ching-te (also known as William Lai[22]) was unanimously elected to succeed her as Chair of the DPP.[23] Lai was previously selected to be Tsai's running mate after she defeated him in the 2020 primary.[24] No primary was held, and Lai Ching-te, being the only individual to register in the party's presidential primary, is the nominee of the Democratic Progressive Party.[25][26][27]\n\nIn November 2023, it was reported that Lai was considering selecting Hsiao Bi-khim (also known as Louise Hsiao), Taiwan's representative to the United States, as his running mate.[28] Hsiao resigned from her position as US representative (de facto ambassador) and returned to Taiwan on 19 November.[29] Lai officially named Hsiao as the election running mate on the same day.[30] Upon selecting Hsiao, Lai called his new running mate \"a warrior for democracy\" with whom he shared a common vision for Taiwan. Lai's decision to have Hsiao as his running mate was seen as a nod to the importance between Taiwan's relationship with the US. The Lai-Hsiao ticket formally registered at the Central Election Commission on 20 November 2023.[31]\n\nNominees [ edit ]\n\nKuomintang [ edit ]\n\nHou Yu-ih, the Mayor of New Taipei since 2018, was drafted by the Kuomintang (KMT) on 17 May 2023 to be its nominee for the presidency.[32] Hou faced opposition from Foxconn founder Terry Gou, who had earlier stated that he would support Hou.[33] On 24 November 2023, the Kuomintang named former legislator Jaw Shaw-kong as its vice presidential candidate.[34]\n\nNominees [ edit ]\n\nTaiwan People's Party [ edit ]\n\nKo Wen-je, being the only individual to register in the party's presidential primary, is the nominee of the Taiwan People's Party (TPP).[35][36] On 24 November 2023, Ko selected Cynthia Wu, current legislator since November 2022, as his running mate.[37]\n\nNominees [ edit ]\n\nOther parties and independents [ edit ]\n\nAll independent and minor party candidates needed a minimum of 290,000 signatures to register with the Central Election Commission.[38]\n\nTerry Gou [ edit ]\n\nAdvertising for Terry Gou's presidential campaign remained on public transportation in the days after he suspended his campaign.\n\nBillionaire businessman Terry Gou, who founded the global technology manufacturing company Foxconn in 1974, declared his own presidential run as an independent candidate on 28 August 2023.[39] This was despite previously stating he would support Kuomintang nominee Hou Yu-ih. The KMT described Gou's announcement as 'deeply regrettable'.[40] Lai Ching-te welcomed Gou's entrance into the race, saying he would be happy to take on the challenge.[41] Gou was the first of the mainstream candidates to announce his running mate; he selected actress Lai Pei-hsia [zh] (otherwise known as Tammy Lai) as his running mate on 14 September.[42] Lai had previously played a fictional Taiwanese presidential candidate on a Chinese-language Netflix series, Wave Makers.[43] Gou's campaign was mired by allegations that it was buying signatures.[44] By November 2023, at least 20 separate investigations into fraudulent practices and signature forgeries were opened.[45] 7 people were arrested in what was described as a 'signature-buying scheme' a few weeks earlier.[38] Gou denied these allegations, and claimed that individuals who were buying signatures were acting on their own accord and were not part of his official campaign. Gou submitted his signatures on 1 November 2023.[46] On 13 November, over 900,000 of Gou's submitted signatures were validated by the election commission, qualifying him to run the presidential election.[47] Amidst the deadline to register with the Central Election Commission, Gou released a statement on 24 November dropping out of the race.[48] In a statement, Gou said \"I'm dropping out, but my aspirations live on.\"[49] He did not endorse a candidate.[50]\n\nNine of ten third-party or independent presidential tickets did not meet the signature petition requirements set by the Central Election Commission, and were disqualified from the election. Including Gou, only five presidential candidates and their running mates attempted to submit signatures. The rest are as follows:[52]\n\nElection campaign [ edit ]\n\nA Lai-Hsiao election poster pictured on a bus in January 2024.\n\nThroughout the election campaign, almost all polls showed Vice President Lai Ching-te winning the election by a plurality, with the rest of the vote being split between the KMT and TPP.[53] Lai's lead increased in September 2023, when Terry Gou announced his own independent bid for the presidency.[54] In August 2023, amid campaigning, Lai Ching-te went to Paraguay for an official visit in his capacity as vice president, with two stopovers in the United States.[55] Lai insisted he was not campaigning during the trips.[56] In late October, China opened an investigation into Foxconn, after Chinese tax authorities conducted an audit of the company's subsidiaries in the Guangdong and Jiangsu provinces.[57] Within the final weeks preceding the election, Lai's lead narrowed as the publication of opinion polls ceased.[58]\n\nLai and Hsiao held their first rally together on 26 November 2023, where they called the election a \"fight for the survival of the country\".[59] Lai's campaign used his late pet dog and Hsiao's pet cats as campaign mascots, the cats allegedly referencing Hsiao's \"cat warrior\" diplomacy.[60] Thousands of Taiwanese academics voiced their support for Lai, arguing the DPP would continue to safeguard the country's democracy.[61] Hou of the KMT said Lai was \"paying lip service\" to voters, and described the election as a choice between war or peace. The TPP generally opted for smaller rallies, which primarily attracted younger voters.[59] As usual, temples were visited by party candidates so as to interact with voters.[62]\n\nUnrealized KMT\u2013TPP joint ticket [ edit ]\n\nIn late 2023, talks of a possible joint ticket between the KMT and TPP began.[63] It was initially unclear if the KMT's Hou Yu-ih and the TPP's Ko Wen-je would join as a ticket, let alone who would be the nominee for president and vice president once a joint ticket was announced.[53] The DPP's Lai stated he would be able to take on the challenge of a joint ticket, and criticized the coalition plans, arguing the two parties do not share enough similarity in ideology.[64][failed verification] In November, Ko said that deciding who would lead the ticket as the presidential nominee was the 'only hurdle' remaining in forming the ticket.[53] On 13 November, the KMT and TPP agreed to use polling to determine the composition of the joint presidential ticket.[65] The order of the joint ticket was to be chosen based on opinion polls and publicly announced on 18 November,[66] but the two sides were unable to come to an agreement on that date.[67] On 18 November, the original deal collapsed following a dispute regarding the polling.[68] The KMT and TPP were reportedly unable to come to a consensus surrounding the margins of error.[69] Despite the initial collapse, there were still attempts to form a pan-blue coalition ticket. Terry Gou, who himself had run in the KMT primary, was informally invited to talks as well.[70] A televised press conference between Hou You-ih, Ko Wen-je, Terry Gou, as well as Eric Chu and Ma Ying-jeou took place on 23 November.[71] The press conference did not yield any agreement between any of the involved parties, and was described as \"bizarre\".[72][73] On 24 November, the deadline for candidate registration, each party announced their own vice presidential candidate, eliminating any chance of a pan-blue ticket.[74]\n\nIssues in focus [ edit ]\n\nThe TPP opted for smaller rallies (pictured).\n\nEnergy and economic policy [ edit ]\n\nHou and Ko both support gradually increasing the use of nuclear energy, (Hou supported 18% use by 2050) while the DPP's Lai supports eliminating nuclear energy by 2050. All three candidates agreed to increase use of renewables.[75] The KMT vice presidential nominee criticized the use of solar energy, preferring nuclear power instead.[76] Cost of living featured as a topic of debate, with a third of voters saying economic issues were pressing. Both Lai and Hou pledged to increase the minimum wage.[77] Lai acknowledged there were shortcomings in the government's approach to help younger people in the country, promising minimum wage would increase from NT$26,400 to NT$27,470 by 2025.[78] Additionally, Lai vowed to offer financial support to Taiwanese start-up companies, saying he would allocate NT$150 billion for small business investment.[79] Ko offered plans to integrate hospitals and bolster the medical field, while the KMT's Hou promised to address mental health.[76]\n\nSocial issues [ edit ]\n\nRights groups such as the Awakening Foundation criticized all three major party candidates for not doing enough to promote gender equality, which includes reducing working hours for parents, the gender pay gap, and child care.[80] In October, Vice President Lai joined a Pride Parade in Taipei, becoming one of the most senior government officials to do so.[81] TPP candidate Ko Wen-je had historically been opposed to same-sex marriage.[82] Both Lai Ching-te and Ko Wen-je signed a pledge organized by the Taiwan Equality Campaign promising to promote and support sexual diversity and LGBT equality.[83] Hou criticized Lai for his lack of a consistent position on capital punishment, which most polls show has been widely supported by the public. At the presidential debate, Lai stated although he was personally opposed to the death penalty, it would remain in place under his administration due to broad public support.[84]\n\nCross-Strait relations and national defense [ edit ]\n\nIn China, Xi Jinping had further asserted his power, having secured an unprecedented third term as General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, the most powerful position in China.[85] The 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine had also prompted fears of an escalation between Mainland China and Taiwan.[86] The CIA also warned not to underestimate the potential of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan.[87] After incumbent President Tsai Ing-wen visited the United States and met with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in April 2023, the Chinese military responded with military exercises near Taiwan.[88] When KMT nominee Hou Yu-ih visited the US, he encouraged the Biden administration to make clear their commitment to defending Taiwan. Later in December, Hou stated he would seek closer ties with China, and criticized the Tsai administration's approach to China.[89] Lai asserted Taiwanese sovereignty, but said a formal declaration of independence would be unnecessary. He also said he would be willing to work with the Chinese government, but only if they renounce any intentions to use force against Taiwan.[90] In November 2023, Lai argued that closer economic ties with like-minded countries could maintain Taiwan's sovereignty while preventing escalation of conflict.[91]\n\nThe DPP generally favored a continuation of the status quo of cross-strait relations coupled by strengthening ties with the United States. Lai did not rule out dialogue with China, but described Taiwanese sovereignty as 'a fact', making any declaration of independence unnecessary.[92] The KMT believed economic links with mainland China and more dialogue would preserve peace between the two.[77] Lai's past self-identification as a \"worker for Taiwanese independence\" led to criticism from both Hou and Ko; Lai argued that Taiwan is a sovereign nation under the name the Republic of China.[58] Lai accused the opposition of befriending the Chinese Communist Party instead of countering them.[58] China's Taiwan Affairs Council described the DPP ticket as a \"separatist duo\". TPP candidate Ko stated that Taiwan should be a bridge between the US and China, rather than what he described as a pawn. Outgoing President Tsai of the DPP highlighted China's one country two systems doctrine with Hong Kong as an example of what could happen if Taiwan were to reunify with mainland China. Polls showed most Taiwanese preferred the status quo.[93] In response to former KMT President Ma Ying-jeou's comments stating Taiwan must rely on Xi Jinping's willingness to not invade, Lai cautioned against trusting the Chinese government; instead he reiterated his plans to strengthen national defense.[94] Again outgoing Tsai reminded voters of Hong Kong's place in China, arguing on 12 January 2024 that greater security would act as the best deterrent to any forceful reunification.[95]\n\nIn 2023, the Ministry of Defense commissioned the building of the first Haikun-class submarine. Launched in September 2023, it is set to enter service by 2025.[96] In an August 2023 interview with Bloomberg, Lai described a strong military capacity as being a form of deterrence against potential Chinese aggression.[90] In October, Lai said that Taiwan's armed forces must be able to safeguard the country.[91] The Chinese government sanctioned five American-based companies for their sale of arms to Taiwan's military one week before the election.[97]\n\nElection interference [ edit ]\n\nLai campaign headquarters in Kaohsiung, in December 2023.\n\nThousands of cases related to election interference were opened by Taiwanese authorities, implicating more than 3,000 individuals. There were 1,430 cases of election gambling and 353 cases involving misinformation. Illegal gains from gambling and bribes exceeded NT$45.11 million (US$1.45 million).[98] Over 40 people were detained under various charges. Another investigation uncovered a large but isolated network of inauthentic social media accounts that promoted the KMT and attacked Ko Wen-je out of the concern that Ko would become a spoiler candidate.[99][100]\n\nInvolving China [ edit ]\n\nHundreds of people were arrested under the Anti-Infiltration Act. Some of them received money from China, made trips there, or subsidized others to travel to the mainland.[98] Ten Taiwanese soldiers were allegedly paid by China to make surrender videos, and one of them was reportedly offered millions to defect in a military helicopter.[100] Taiwanese intelligence reported that China coordinated disinformation campaigns on social media to influence the election.[101] According to the BBC, these efforts were meant to drive a wedge between Taiwan and the US, portraying the latter as unreliable regarding defense. Most sources of disinformation, however, were credited to Taiwanese groups favorable to China.[102]\n\nDebates [ edit ]\n\nDebates for presidential candidates and vice presidential candidates were announced on 8 December. These were organized by eleven Taiwanese media corporations including Taiwan's Public Television Service as the host, and include all three candidates for president and vice president, respectively.[19][103] The presidential and vice-presidential debates were held on 30 December and 1 January respectively.[104][14] Prior to the debates, Central Election Commission organized several televised policy presentations on 20, 26, and 28 December for presidential candidates and on 22 December for vice presidential candidates.[15][16][17]\n\nIn the presidential policy presentations and only debate, Lai and Hou both sparred over cross-strait relations, with the two disagreeing on how to approach China. Hou also accused the DPP of corruption and criticized the party's handling of COVID-19.[105] He repeatedly attacked Lai over his past support for Taiwanese independence, and reiterated the need for dialogue with China. He also rejected any possibility of a one country, two systems reunification plan for Taiwan.[106] Lai in contrast compared the KMT backed 1992 Consensus with China with Hong Kong's one country, two systems model with China. He claimed annexing Taiwan is China's national policy, and cautioned against embracing their ideals. Simultaneously, he stated the importance of a peaceful Taiwan Strait.[107] He stated his support for bolstering self-defense, increasing use of renewable energy, and the implementation of policies for strengthening the economy. Ko attempted to appeal to the youth, addressing housing, wages and other issues. He said he too was open to dialogue with the Chinese government.[108] Notably, Hou spoke in Taiwanese Hokkien on numerous occasions.[109]\n\nIn the Vice Presidential presentations and debate, Wu repeatedly stressed her experience working with the US and strengthening trade, while Jaw called the DPP's Lai a \"terrorist\". Jaw was also subject to a gaffe in which he accidentally referred to Lai as his \"boss\". Hsiao criticized her opponents for questioning her Taiwanese nationality, and also accused them of being overly reliant on China for economic prosperity.[110] Trade and concerns over China played large roles in all vice presidential debates and presentations.[111] The debate in particular focussed on trade, energy and foreign policy.[112] New Bloom Magazine declared the Vice Presidential debate as a \"clear win\" for Hsiao.[113]\n\nForeign observations [ edit ]\n\nThe elections were described as \"crucial\" regarding foreign policy.[114][115] The election was also described as being \"closely watched\" due to its impact on cross-strait ties.[58] CNN stated the election 'could change the world'.[116]\n\nOpinion polling [ edit ]\n\nResults [ edit ]\n\nAll election results were released at 22:00 on 13 January, and showed that Lai Ching-te had won with 40.05% of the vote.[117]\n\nResults by Administrative division [ edit ]\n\nAftermath [ edit ]\n\nDPP supporters gathered outside campaign headquarters as Lai gave his victory speech.\n\nAt around 20:00, Hou conceded to Lai in an address to his supporters at his campaign headquarters in New Taipei. He also apologized for failing to end eight years of DPP rule.[118] At 20:04, Ko addressed his supporters at his campaign headquarters in New Taipei. He said that the TPP's campaign showed the world that Taiwan was no longer dominated by the \"green\" and \"blue\" camps and urged his supporters to continue their hard work for the next election.[119]\n\nIn a social media reflection over the campaign on 15 January, Hou's running mate Jaw Shau-kong said that in order to win future elections, the Kuomintang needed to undertake major reforms such as \"incorporating a bit of socialist [messaging] on wealth equality,\" ensuring that its membership better reflected Taiwan's demographics, and promoting greater democracy and transparency in its nomination system.[120] At a Central Standing Committee meeting of the Kuomintang on 17 January, its leadership acknowledged that although 60% of the electorate voted against the DPP, the failure to establish a joint ticket with the TPP undermined its chances of winning the election. They also attributed the Kuomintang's defeat to its failure to attract support from younger voters as well as those living in southern Taiwan, where it lost to the DPP by 700,000 votes, and what it called the \"apparatus of the state\" manipulated by the outgoing government in favor of Lai. Amid calls within the Kuomintang for his resignation, party chairman Eric Chu insisted that he would \"shoulder all responsibilities and endure humiliations to stay in the position until the end of his term\" in 2025.[121]\n\nDuring his victory speech, Lai thanked Hou and Ko for conceding, as well as the Taiwanese people for \"writing a new chapter in our democracy\" and taking a stand against authoritarianism, adding that they \"successfully resisted efforts from external forces to influence this election.\" He expressed hope for \"healthy and orderly\" exchanges with China but also pledged to defend Taiwan from \"continuing threats and intimidation\" from its neighbour.[122] He called on China to \"recognize the new situation, and understand that only peace benefits both sides of the strait.\"[123]\n\nOutgoing president Tsai Ing-wen congratulated Lai and his running mate Hsiao Bi-kim and said the elections expressed Taiwan's \"determination to maintain democracy\" and their \"love for Taiwan and for freedom\".[124]\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Taiwan alleged that China encouraged Nauru to shift diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China, pressured ASEAN countries to \"echo the fictitious narrative of the so-called 'one China principle\" and instigated statements made by the Solomon Islands, the Maldives, and Bangladesh disparaging Taiwan's sovereignty status.[125]\n\nInternational reactions [ edit ]\n\nPeople's Republic of China [ edit ]\n\nDuring the voting, the hashtag \"Taiwan election\" became a top-trending topic in Weibo, at one point reaching 163.2 million views before it was removed. Chinese state media also provided little coverage on the vote.[126]\n\nFollowing Lai's victory, the Taiwan Affairs Office said the elections \"cannot stop the unstoppable trend of the eventual reunification of the motherland\" and that the DPP \"cannot represent the mainstream public opinion\" in Taiwan.[127] A mainland China foreign ministry spokesperson said that regardless of the election result, \"the basic fact that there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is part of China will not change.\"[123] In response, the Taiwan-run Mainland Affairs Council urged Beijing to \"fully respect the election results and Taiwan's public opinion,\" and \"rationally assess\" the post-election situation.[128]\n\nThe government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) lodged formal complaints after Japan and the United States expressed congratulations to Lai, warning them against interfering in \"China's internal affairs\", sending wrong signals to Taiwanese independence advocates, and violating pledges to maintain only unofficial ties with Taiwan.[129][130] It also made d\u00e9marches to Singapore after its foreign ministry welcomed and congratulated the election,[131] and summoned Philippine ambassador Jaime FlorCruz following President Bongbong Marcos' congratulatory message to Lai.[132]\n\nDuring election day, eight Chinese military aircraft and six naval vessels were detected by Taiwan's Defense Ministry.[133] On 14 January, a day after Lai's victory was confirmed, four Chinese military vessels and a high-altitude balloon were detected around Taiwan.[134]\n\nOther countries [ edit ]\n\nSupranational organizations [ edit ]\n\nEuropean Union: A statement issued by a spokesperson for foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said it \"welcomed\" Taiwan's presidential election and \"congratulates all the voters who participated in this democratic exercise\". It also expressed concern about \"growing tensions in the Taiwan Strait and opposes any unilateral attempt to change the status quo.\" [ 164 ]\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\nMedia related to Republic of China presidential election, 2024 at Wikimedia Commons",

        "text": "Inaugural Address of ROC 16th-term President Lai Ching-te\nInaugural Address of ROC 16th-term President Lai Ching-te\n\nInaugural Address of ROC 16th-term President Lai Ching-te\n\nOn the morning of May 20, ROC 16th-term President Lai Ching-te, the first lady, and Vice President Bi-khim Hsiao attended inaugural celebrations in the plaza fronting the Presidential Office Building. President Lai delivered his inaugural address titled \u201cBuilding a democratic, peaceful, and prosperous new Taiwan.\u201d\n\nThe following is a translation of President Lai\u2019s remarks:\n\nVice President Bi-khim Hsiao, esteemed heads of state and guests from our allies, distinguished ambassadors and representatives, all visiting dignitaries, dear friends watching live on television and online, fellow citizens across the country: Good morning.\n\nWhen I was young, I was determined to practice medicine and save lives. When I went into politics, I was determined to transform Taiwan.\n\nNow, standing here, I am determined to strengthen the nation. With an unwavering heart, I accept the responsibility the people have entrusted to me as the 16th-term president of the Republic of China. In accordance with the Republic of China Constitution system, I will take on that solemn responsibility of leading the nation bravely forward.\n\nOn this day in 1949, martial law went into effect in Taiwan, and Taiwan plunged into a dark era of authoritarian rule.\n\nOn this day in 1996, Taiwan\u2019s first democratically elected president took the oath of office, conveying to the international community that the Republic of China Taiwan is a sovereign, independent nation in which sovereignty lies in the hands of the people.\n\nOn this day in 2024, having completed our third transition of political power, Taiwan officially commences, for the first time, the third consecutive term of the same political party in office. We also set sail into a new era that is full of challenges, yet also brimming with limitless hope.\n\nThis journey came about as a result of the valiant sacrifices and devotion of the many generations of people of this land. Although it was an arduous one, we made it through.\n\nNow, we not only witness the beginning of a new administration, but also usher in another hard-earned victory for democracy.\n\nMany people have interpreted my and Vice President Bi-khim Hsiao\u2019s election victory as \u201cbreaking the eight-year curse,\u201d referring to the fact that no political party has been able to remain in office for over two terms. But the reality is that in a democracy, the people have the final say. There is no such thing as a \u201ccurse\u201d in any election. It is simply that the people put the ruling party under the toughest of tests, choosing the nation\u2019s future in the most genuine way.\n\nI want to thank former President Tsai Ing-wen, former Vice President Chen Chien-jen, and the administrative team for their hard work over these past eight years. You have all helped build a solid base for Taiwan\u2019s development. Let\u2019s give them a big round of applause!\n\nI also want to thank my fellow citizens once again for your support, for refusing to be swayed by external forces, for resolutely defending democracy, for pressing onward without turning back, and for turning a new page in Taiwan\u2019s history.\n\nEvery day of my term, I will strive to prove myself as someone in whom you can trust and count on, by acting justly, showing mercy, and being humble, and by treating our people as family. The new administration will work tirelessly and to the best of our ability, as all the nation\u2019s people put us to the test. We will also pursue continuous reform, shaping a new face for Taiwanese politics.\n\nI. Coordination and cooperation between the executive and legislative branches to advance national policy\n\nIn February this year, a new Legislative Yuan was sworn in. This is the first time in 16 years that no party has an absolute majority. In the face of this new political landscape, some are feeling anticipation, while others are anxious.\n\nI want to say to everyone, that this new structure is a result of the people\u2019s choice. Looking at it with a different frame of mind, a lack of absolute majority means that the ruling and opposition parties are now all able to share their ideas, and that we will be undertaking the nation\u2019s challenges as one.\n\nHowever, Taiwan\u2019s people have high expectations for rational governance among political parties. Apart from competition, parties should also believe in cooperation. Only then can the nation continue down a stable path.\n\nThe Legislative Yuan should observe procedural justice. The majority should respect the minority, while the minority accepts majority rule. Only then can we avoid conflict and maintain a stable and harmonious society.\n\nIn a democratic society, the interests of the people come first \u2013 that is the root of democracy. Likewise, national interests come before the interests of parties \u2013 that is the sacred duty of each political party. When ruling or opposition parties put forth legislation that conforms with our Constitution; when we uphold the spirit of \u201cpeople above all\u201d and \u201cnation above party,\u201d national policy will naturally and smoothly progress.\n\nPremier Cho Jung-tai (\u5353\u69ae\u6cf0) will lead the cabinet, and prioritize solving issues which benefit society and reflect consensus among ruling and opposition parties. He will respond to public opinion and address the issues people care about with proactive efforts and innovative thinking, and thus serve the people of Taiwan.\n\nToday, recovery work following the April 3 earthquake is still underway. I would like to once again express my sympathy and condolences to the victims and their families. I also want to thank all our citizens who have assisted in the earthquake response and reconstruction efforts, as well as the international community for their concern and support.\n\nThe central government has already drawn up plans to funnel NT$28.55 billion into reconstruction and industry stimulus. This will help the people of Hualien return to their normal lives as quickly as possible.\n\nI have high hopes for the future of cooperation between the central and local governments, as well as coordination between the executive and legislative branches. I also hope to work hard alongside all the people of Taiwan to further entrench our democracy, maintain peace in the Indo-Pacific, and boost global prosperity.\n\nII. Democratic Taiwan as a global beacon\n\nMy fellow citizens: Democracy, peace, and prosperity form Taiwan\u2019s national roadmap. And they are also our links to the world.\n\nAs an important link in the global chain of democracies, a glorious era of Taiwan\u2019s democracy has arrived.\n\nSince Taiwan first held direct presidential elections, we have grown to become one of the world\u2019s most vibrant democracies. We have continued to enhance human rights, and show the world our values of democracy and freedom.\n\nTaiwan was the first country in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage.\n\nTaiwan showed that democracy outperforms authoritarianism in fighting the pandemic.\n\nWhether in terms of democracy or freedom, Taiwan is consistently highly ranked among Asian nations. Democratic Taiwan is already a global beacon. And this honor belongs to all the people of Taiwan.\n\nAs we move forward, my administration will continue using Taiwan\u2019s democratic vitality as a force for good, to promote national development and deepen international cooperation.\n\nIn terms of internal affairs, I will value meritocracy, and uphold honesty and diligence. I will practice democratic governance, and establish an open government. In the spirit of transparency and rule by the people, I encourage the populace to participate in public policy, and will continue to promote a voting age of 18. Together, we will fulfill our vision for our nation.\n\nAs for international affairs, we will continue working with other democratic nations to form a democratic community, and share our experiences across a range of fields. We will work together to combat disinformation, strengthen democratic resilience, address challenges, and allow Taiwan to become the MVP of the democratic world.\n\nIII. Democratic Taiwan as a pilot for global peace\n\nPeace is priceless, and war has no winners. Next year, we will mark the 80th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. As with other nations, Taiwan walked a difficult path for post-war revitalization, before getting to where we are today. No one wants these achievements to be destroyed by war.\n\nToday, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and conflict between Israel and Hamas continue to shake the whole world. And China\u2019s military actions and gray-zone coercion are considered the greatest strategic challenges to global peace and stability.\n\nTaiwan is strategically positioned in the first island chain, and what affects us here affects global geopolitical development. Even as early as 1921, Chiang Wei-shui (\u8523\u6e2d\u6c34) said that Taiwan is a frontline guardian of world peace. Now, in 2024, Taiwan\u2019s role is even more significant.\n\nThere is already a strong international consensus, that peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait are indispensable to global security and prosperity.\n\nTo adapt to today\u2019s complicated international landscape, countries around the world have been actively cooperating to maintain regional peace and stability.\n\nJust last month, the United States made into law the Indo-Pacific Security Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2024. This will provide the Indo-Pacific region with additional security and assistance, thereby supporting the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait.\n\nWe thank nations around the world for their consideration and support for Taiwan. We would also like to declare to all that democracy and freedom are Taiwan\u2019s unwavering commitments. Peace is the only option. And prosperity, gained through lasting peace and stability, is our objective.\n\nThe future of cross-strait relations will have a decisive impact on the world. This means that we, who have inherited a democratic Taiwan, are pilots for peace. Our government will uphold the Four Commitments, neither yield nor provoke, and maintain the status quo.\n\nI also want to call on China to cease their political and military intimidation against Taiwan, share with Taiwan the global responsibility of maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait as well as the greater region, and ensure the world is free from the fear of war.\n\nTaiwanese are a peace-loving people who treat others with kindness. I have always believed that if the leader of a country puts the people\u2019s welfare above all, then peace in the Taiwan Strait, mutual benefits, and prosperous coexistence would be common goals.\n\nTherefore, I hope that China will face the reality of the Republic of China\u2019s existence, respect the choices of the people of Taiwan, and in good faith, choose dialogue over confrontation, exchange over containment, and under the principles of parity and dignity, engage in cooperation with the legal government chosen by Taiwan\u2019s people. This can start from the resumption of tourism on a reciprocal basis, and enrollment of degree students in Taiwanese institutions. Let us together pursue peace and mutual prosperity.\n\nMy fellow citizens: As we pursue the ideal of peace, we must not harbor any delusions. So long as China refuses to renounce the use of force against Taiwan, all of us in Taiwan ought to understand, that even if we accept the entirety of China\u2019s position and give up our sovereignty, China\u2019s ambition to annex Taiwan will not simply disappear.\n\nIn face of the many threats and attempts of infiltration from China, we must demonstrate our resolution to defend our nation, and we must also raise our defense awareness and strengthen our legal framework for national security. This means actively promoting the Four Pillars of Peace action plan: strengthened national defense; improved economic security; stable and principled cross-strait leadership; and values-based diplomacy. By standing side-by-side with other democratic countries, we can form a peaceful global community that can demonstrate the strength of deterrence and prevent war, achieving our goal of peace through strength.\n\nIV. Democratic Taiwan as a force for global prosperity\n\nTaiwan needs the world, just as the world needs Taiwan. Taiwan is not just opening a door to the world \u2013 Taiwan is already on the world\u2019s center stage.\n\nAs we look toward our future, we know that semiconductors will be indispensable. And the AI wave has already swept in. Taiwan has already mastered advanced semiconductor manufacturing, and we stand at the center of the AI revolution. We are a key player in supply chains for global democracies. For these reasons, Taiwan has an influence on global economic development, as well as humanity\u2019s well-being and prosperity.\n\nMy fellow citizens: The future of the Republic of China Taiwan will be decided by its 23 million people. The future we decide is not just the future of our nation, but the future of the world.\n\nWe must walk on the right path, and our industries must make every effort, so that we may be a force for global prosperity. With every step forward that Taiwan takes, the world takes a step forward with us.\n\nWhen I served as premier and vice president, I visited the various industries throughout Taiwan. I know well what our industry needs, and also what it is capable of. So, going forward, the government, working closely with the private sector, will take a threefold approach to further Taiwan\u2019s development.\n\nThe first is having a clear view for our future, and making Taiwan smart and sustainable.\n\nAs we face the dangers of climate change, we must be resolved in our transition to net-zero emissions by the year 2050. As we meet the global challenges of adopting more and more smart technologies, we in Taiwan, a \u201csilicon island,\u201d must do all we can to expedite Taiwan\u2019s transformation into an \u201cAI island.\u201d We must adapt AI for industry and step up the pace of AI innovation and applications. We must also adapt industry for AI and use AI\u2019s computational power to make our nation, our military, our workforce, and our economy stronger.\n\nIt is similarly crucial that we develop an economic model driven by innovation. Through our two-pronged approach of promoting digital transformation and net-zero transition, we will assist small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as they upgrade and transform, and we will seek inclusive growth, so as to create a new Taiwan that is smarter and more sustainable \u2013 a second Taiwan Miracle.\n\nWhile we invest in innovation and nurture the next hidden champions, we must also make bold investments in quantum computing, robotics, the metaverse, precision medicine, and other advanced technologies, thus giving our young people the opportunity to pursue their dreams and solidifying Taiwan\u2019s leading position in the future global landscape.\n\nThe second is setting our sights on the space industry while further developing our strengths as a maritime nation.\n\nOur sights are set on making Taiwan the Asian hub of UAV supply chains for global democracies, and developing the next generation of medium- and low-orbit communications satellites, bringing Taiwan\u2019s space and aerospace industries squarely into the international sphere.\n\nAt the same time, we will also explore and develop our strengths as a maritime nation, deepen our connections with the ocean, and invest more in marine science and technology research, thereby driving the development of our maritime industries. Altogether, this will make Taiwan a much stronger nation, and it will open up new horizons for the development of Taiwan\u2019s economy and industry. The possibilities are truly limitless.\n\nThe third is to help our enterprises expand their presence and market internationally.\n\nTaiwan has officially applied to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), and we will continue to engage actively in regional economic integration. We will endeavor to sign bilateral investment agreements with other democracies around the world and further deepen our trade partnerships. We will also work to resolve the carbon tax issue and thus open the path for further industrial development.\n\nTaiwan must hold firm its key position in the global supply chain and seize the business opportunities that come as a result of geopolitical changes. We aim to develop Five Trusted Industry Sectors, namely semiconductors, AI, military, security and surveillance, and next-generation communications; we also aim to improve the investment environment, welcome Taiwanese businesses abroad to come back and invest in Taiwan, and encourage local firms to expand their investments and set even deeper roots here in Taiwan.\n\nHere today, I want to assure our friends from all different sectors: Just as you all are committed to be the best in your respective areas, the government is also committed to providing assistance so that you can expand your global presence and international markets from a solid base here in Taiwan.\n\nTaiwan is eminently capable of being a thriving global economic powerhouse. Wherever the sun shines around the world, there are Taiwanese companies stimulating local development, while also enriching the livelihoods of the Taiwanese people.\n\nV. Sympathizing with the joys and the concerns of the people\n\nIt is my firm belief that the fruits of economic development ought to be enjoyed by all the people of our nation. In the coming days of my presidency, I will launch the National Project of Hope and expand investment in society, through which I aim to shape a Taiwanese society with more love and moral courage. It will be a society in which young people have a vision of hope, people in their prime have the means to realize their dreams, the elderly can enjoy their days in happiness, and the disadvantaged can find the care they need. A society in which all people, at every stage of life, will be able to receive from the government the support they need.\n\nChildcare, long-term care, and social housing services will continue to be expanded. Prices of commodities and housing, as well as the wealth gap, will be addressed. The safety and security of our food, our roads, our schools, and our social safety net will all be enhanced. And our reform efforts in education, the judicial system, and transitional justice will continue.\n\nI understand the concerns and expectations of the people of Taiwan. As to the issues you are concerned with and the reform society needs, the government will do its utmost to achieve solutions.\n\nEveryone is working hard for higher pay. I will work to drive industrial upgrading and create an even better wage environment.\n\nEveryone is hoping for more effective public safety. I will crack down on corruption and organized crime, guns, drugs, and fraud.\n\nEveryone is wanting a stable supply of electricity. I will initiate our second energy transition, push for the development of more forms of green energy and smart grids, and help to make our electrical power generation system more resilient.\n\nEveryone is concerned about the financing of labor insurance. I repeat here today: Labor insurance will not fail under our government.\n\nEveryone is stressing the importance of transportation safety. I will help create a human-friendly transportation environment, putting an end to Taiwan\u2019s bad reputation as a \u201cpedestrian hell.\u201d\n\nEveryone is hoping that the government can help lighten the load for family caregivers and work to solve the labor shortage issue. I will do my utmost to arrive at solutions.\n\nAll of us, as we walk into the future, want a more resilient Taiwan, a Taiwan that can respond adequately to such crises as infectious disease and natural disasters, a Taiwan that can quicken the pace of urban renewal and the repair of dilapidated and dangerous old buildings.\n\nAll of us are also hoping for a healthier Taiwan. With my own expertise in medicine, I hope to bring together the strengths of other fields to beat cancer. I will establish a ministry of physical education and sports development to bring sports and athletics more into the lives of the people. I will also ensure that our National Health Insurance system remains sustainable, which will help our people live longer and healthier.\n\nThe Taiwan of tomorrow will preserve its diverse ecosystem, its diverse ethnic culture, and achieve sustainability, to create a better nation.\n\nThe Taiwan of tomorrow will have a more diverse innovation economy, a more widespread use of digital technology applications; it will be more competitive and bilingual; it will have a stronger public support service system; it will be more respectful of gender equality; it will ensure that the people are guaranteed their rights.\n\nThe Taiwan of tomorrow will allow each municipality to develop out of its own unique characteristics and promote revitalization of local industries; we will achieve the goal of a Taiwan with balanced development where all can live and work in peace and happiness.\n\nVI. With greater solidarity, we become stronger as a nation\n\nMy dear compatriots, each and every one of you contributes a necessary part to our future development. In this era of globalization and wide-ranging competition, no one country can go it alone; and no society, if it is divided within, can successfully meet these challenges.\n\nIf we are united, we can walk with more confident strides. And when we support one another, our steps will take us further. For our nation to endure and progress, I will bring us together through the strength of democracy, for greater solidarity and a stronger nation.\n\nI think it is apparent to us all: We have a nation insofar as we have sovereignty. Right in the first chapter of our Constitution, it says that \u201cThe sovereignty of the Republic of China shall reside in the whole body of citizens,\u201d and that \u201cPersons possessing the nationality of the Republic of China shall be citizens of the Republic of China.\u201d These two articles tell us clearly: The Republic of China and the People\u2019s Republic of China are not subordinate to each other. All of the people of Taiwan must come together to safeguard our nation; all our political parties ought to oppose annexation and protect sovereignty; and no one should entertain the idea of giving up our national sovereignty in exchange for political power.\n\nAs more countries around the world publicly express their support for Taiwan\u2019s meaningful international participation, there is increasing proof that Taiwan is a Taiwan of the world; that Taiwan is a worthy and reliable force for global peace and prosperity.\n\nSo long as we identify with Taiwan, Taiwan belongs to us all \u2013 all of the peoples of Taiwan, regardless of ethnicity, irrespective of when we arrived. Some call this land the Republic of China, some call it the Republic of China Taiwan, and some, Taiwan; but whichever of these names we ourselves or our international friends choose to call our nation, we will resonate and shine all the same. So let us overcome our differences and stride forward, with our shared aspirations, to meet the world.\n\nVII. Taiwan greeting a new world, the world greeting a new Taiwan\n\nAs Taiwan engages more closely with the rest of the world, we welcome the world to come closer to Taiwan. Many new residents and foreign nationals have come and made Taiwan their home, writing a new chapter in Taiwan\u2019s story. To all of you, I give my sincere thanks and respect.\n\nHere today are many friends who have come quite a long way from their countries to join us. And many overseas compatriots are also here showing their support with their presence. So, why don\u2019t we let them all know how much we appreciate their support? Please give them a round of applause!\n\nTonight we will be welcoming our distinguished guests at a state banquet in Tainan, the city where 1624 marked Taiwan\u2019s links to globalization. Now, as we stand here 400 years after that historical moment in Tainan, we in Taiwan must all demonstrate confidence and bravely set course for the new world, so that the world may embrace a new Taiwan.\n\nOn that note, I want to ask each fellow citizen to praise our mother Taiwan, the land that nurtures and supports us all, and to work together to protect her, honor her, let the world embrace her, and allow her the international respect she deserves as a great nation.\n\nThank you.",

        "text": "VA to grant 1 millionth benefit claim for Veterans and their survivors under the PACT Act\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Today, the Department of Veterans Affairs expects to grant its 1 millionth PACT Act-related disability compensation claims to Veterans and survivors since President Biden signed the bill into law on Aug. 10, 2022. The grant rate for these claims is 75% \u2013 a sharp increase from pre-PACT levels \u2013 and VA has delivered more than $5.7 billion in earned benefits to these Veterans and survivors.\n\nThe PACT Act expanded VA health care and benefits to millions of Veterans, including adding \u201cpresumptive\u201d service connection for hundreds of conditions linked to burn pits, agent orange, and other hazards while serving our country. Presumptions such as these lower the burden of proof required to receive disability benefits, helping Veterans get the benefits they deserve as quickly as possible. The average service connection rate for Veterans with these granted claims is 70%, meaning that they receive more than $20,000 in earned benefits payments from VA each year.\n\nPresident Biden believes the nation has a sacred obligation to take care of Veterans, their families, caregivers, and survivors, and he has made supporting Veterans a key pillar of his Unity Agenda for the nation. VA encourages all Veterans to visit VA.gov/PACT to learn more and apply for the care and benefits they deserve today.\n\n\u201cThanks to President Biden, the Veterans who were exposed to burn pits, Agent Orange, and other hazards while serving our country are now being taken care of for the conditions that followed them home from war,\u201d said VA Secretary Denis McDonough. \u201cWhenever a Veteran gets a claim granted, it means life-changing monthly payments and access to no-cost VA health care for that condition. We\u2019re proud that we\u2019ve granted 1 million PACT Act-related claims for Veterans and survivors, but we won\u2019t rest until every Veteran and every survivor gets the VA health care and benefits they deserve.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks to the PACT Act, VA is delivering more benefits to more Veterans than ever before,\u201d said Under Secretary for Benefits Joshua Jacobs. \u201cWe encourage all toxic-exposed Veterans and their survivors to apply today for care and benefits at VA.gov/PACT. When you apply, we will stop at nothing to get you the benefits you\u2019ve earned.\u201d\n\nThrough the PACT Act, VA has been able to help millions of Veterans get the health care and benefits they deserve. Key impacts include:\n\nMore Veterans are enrolling in health care: More than 400,000 Veterans have enrolled in VA health care over the past year, a 30% increase year-over-year.This is critical because Veterans who come to VA are proven to have better or equal health outcomes, higher satisfaction scores, and trust VA outpatient care at 91.8%.\n\nMore than 400,000 Veterans have enrolled in VA health care over the past year, a 30% increase year-over-year.This is critical because Veterans who come to VA are proven to have better or equal health outcomes, higher satisfaction scores, and trust VA outpatient care at 91.8%. More than 5.4 million Veterans have been screened by VA for toxic exposures: These screenings are a critical step to detecting, understanding, and treating potentially life-threatening health conditions. Of the 5.4 million Veterans who have received the screening, 44% reported at least one potential exposure.\n\nThese screenings are a critical step to detecting, understanding, and treating potentially life-threatening health conditions. Of the 5.4 million Veterans who have received the screening, 44% reported at least one potential exposure. Veterans are applying for benefits at all-time record rates: Thanks to the largest outreach campaign in VA history, Veterans and survivors submitted 2,433,729 claims applications in 2023 \u2013 an all-time record and 39% more than in 2022. Veterans and survivors are on pace to break this record again in 2024.\n\nThanks to the largest outreach campaign in VA history, Veterans and survivors submitted 2,433,729 claims applications in 2023 \u2013 an all-time record and 39% more than in 2022. Veterans and survivors are on pace to break this record again in 2024. Veterans exposed to toxins and other environmental hazards are now eligible for VA health care: In March, as directed by President Biden, VA announced that all Veterans who meet eligibility requirements and were exposed to toxins and other hazards while serving in the military \u2014 at home or abroad \u2014 had become eligible to enroll directly in VA health care. This expansion eliminated the phased-in approach called for by the PACT Act \u2014 meaning that millions of Veterans are becoming eligible for VA health care up to eight years earlier than written into law.\n\nThe 1 million granted PACT Act-related claims are claims from more than 888,000 Veterans and survivors that included a PACT Act condition where at least one condition from the claim was granted, regardless of whether the granted condition is one of the PACT-specific conditions noted above. In total, VA has received 1.65 million PACT Act-related claims and completed more than 1.32 million since August 2022. More information and data on the impact of the PACT Act can be found in VA\u2019s biweekly PACT Act Dashboard.\n\nVA is currently processing Veteran benefits claims at the fastest rate in history, delivering more benefits, more quickly, to more Veterans than ever before. As a result of this record pace, Veteran claims pending over 125 days \u2013 known as the backlog \u2013 has decreased by more than 100,000 claims since December. Moving forward, VA will continue to aggressively reach out to Veterans to encourage them to come to VA. VA encourages all Veterans, family members, caregivers, and survivors to learn more about VA and apply for their world-class health care and earned benefits today.",

        "text": "New report shows that business R&D funding dominates the U.S. R&D enterprise\nNews Release\n\nMay 21, 2024\n\nThe United States is the largest performer of research and experimental development (R&D), with $806 billion in gross domestic expenditures on R&D in 2021, followed by China, with $668 billion. While overall funding of R&D in the U.S. continues to rise rapidly, the share of basic research funded by the federal government has fallen in the previous decade. Business funding of U.S. R&D surpassed federal funding in the 1980s and now dominates the U.S. R&D enterprise. These are among the findings in Research and Development: U.S. Trends and International Comparisons published today by the National Science Board (NSB).\n\nPrepared by the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics under NSB guidance, this report is part of the 2024 edition of the congressionally mandated Science and Engineering Indicators report on the state of the U.S. science and engineering enterprise.\n\nThe business sector is by far the largest performer of U.S. R&D, performing an estimated $693 billion in 2022, or 78% of U.S. R&D. Nearly 80% of business investment is in experimental development \u2013 the stage when the promise of near-term commercial benefit is real. Private sector R&D is also highly concentrated, clustering in a few key sectors such as information technology and pharmaceuticals.\n\nIndustry is well positioned to advance knowledge in targeted fields,\u201d says Roger Beachy, NSB member and Washington University Professor Emeritus. \u201cBut only the federal government has invested across all fields, across the nation, at scale, and over long-time horizons to create new knowledge that helps us address current and future security, health, and economic challenges.\u201d\n\nAdditional takeaways:\n\nOther top R&D performers are Japan ($177 billion), Germany ($154 billion), and South Korea ($120 billion).\n\nThe United States is among the world\u2019s most R&D-intensive economies, with R&D expenditures equaling 3.5% of its gross domestic product in 2021. Israel and South Korea had R&D intensities above 4%. Taiwan, Japan, and Germany were between 3% and 4%, and the United Kingdom and China above 2%.\n\nIn the U.S., higher education performed the second most R&D in 2022, after business.\n\nFunding for life sciences research was the highest among S&E fields across agencies at $42 billion (44% of the total), primarily from the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nResearch and Development: U.S. Trends and International Comparisons is the ninth of 10 Science and Engineering Indicators reports published. In the coming weeks, NSB will publish the final 2024 Indicators report, The STEM Labor Force: Scientists, Engineers, and Skilled Technical Workers.\n\nAbout Science and Engineering Indicators\n\nScience and Engineering Indicators is a congressionally mandated report on the state of the U.S. and international science and engineering enterprise. Indicators provides high-quality quantitative information on the enterprise in a series of reports and a data tool that provides state-level data.\n\nAbout the NSB\n\nThe National Science Foundation Act of 1950 charged the NSB with two roles: to be the governing board of the NSF and an advisor to Congress and the President on policy matters related to STEM research and STEM education. Selected for their distinguished service and accomplishments in academia, government, and the private sector, the Board\u2019s 24 presidentially appointed members are leaders in STEM research and education.\n\nAbout the NCSES\n\nNSF\u2019s National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES) is the nation's leading provider of statistical data on the U.S. science and engineering enterprise. As a principal federal statistical agency, NCSES serves as a clearinghouse for the collection, interpretation, analysis, and dissemination of objective science and engineering data.\n\nMedia Contact: Nadine Lymn, National Science Board, (703) 292-2490, nlymn@nsf.gov\n\nThe U.S. National Science Foundation propels the nation forward by advancing fundamental research in all fields of science and engineering. NSF supports research and people by providing facilities, instruments and funding to support their ingenuity and sustain the U.S. as a global leader in research and innovation. With a fiscal year 2023 budget of $9.5 billion, NSF funds reach all 50 states through grants to nearly 2,000 colleges, universities and institutions. Each year, NSF receives more than 40,000 competitive proposals and makes about 11,000 new awards. Those awards include support for cooperative research with industry, Arctic and Antarctic research and operations, and U.S. participation in international scientific efforts.\n\nUseful NSB Web Sites:\n\nHome Page: http://www.nsf.gov/nsb\n\nMedia Contact: http://www.nsf.gov/staff/staff_bio.jsp?lan=nlymn&org=NSF\n\nNews: http://www.nsf.gov/nsb/news\n\nMeetings: http://www.nsf.gov/nsb/meetings\n\nPublications: http://www.nsf.gov/nsb/publications\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/NationalScienceBoard\n\nTwitter: Twitter: https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=NSF_NSB\n\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkrHRzuGSrPp2haQs0T_Pww\n\n",

Mr Biden argues that Mr Trump has repeatedly \"made it clear he doesn't want\" voters who supported her.\n\nMr Trump, who has mocked his ex-cabinet member as a \"bird brain\", was angered by her prolonged primary challenge and recently shot down rumours that she was under consideration to be his vice-presidential running mate.\n\nSpeaking on Wednesday before a gathering at the conservative Hudson Institute think-tank in Washington DC, Ms Haley maintained the criticisms of both parties she made in her campaign.\n\nBut she reserved her strongest words for the incumbent.\n\nMr Biden, she said, oversaw a \"debacle\" in Afghanistan, \"did nothing to deter the invasion\" of Ukraine and, most recently, \"threw Israel to the wolves\".\n\n\"As a voter, I put my priorities on a president who's going to have the backs of our allies and hold our enemies to account, who would secure the border, who would support capitalism and freedom, who understands we need less debt not more debt,\" she said.\n\n\"Trump has not been perfect on these policies but Biden has been a catastrophe. So I will be voting for Trump.\"",

        "text": "US-French Relations After the US Election\nThe underlying anti-Americanism that permeates French political culture has somehow worked to the benefit of the transatlantic relationship in recent years. Having limited expectations of your main ally can prove a factor of stability at a time when some Europeans, genuinely stunned by the evolution of US politics, react more emotionally. This was certainly the case after the 2016 election of Donald Trump. In 2024, however, the stakes are even higher for the French-US relationship. The results of the US elections could define the future of the European project and, with it, impact French core interests.\n\nThe French foreign policy vision is unlikely to change after 2024. Now more than ever, Europe needs to develop its own political, economic, military, industrial, and technological capabilities to be able to defend its interests in a world of great-power competition. For Macron, France\u2019s security and prosperity depend on the success of this effort, and the person in the White House in January 2025 will determine what role the United States will play in it.\n\nIn this context, a Trump victory would constitute a more direct shock for Paris in the short term. The prospect of a Biden reelection, while giving Europe more time to step up, also requires a serious effort of preparation.\n\nThe Trump Scenario\n\n\u201cMacron, do you know Macron? He is a nice guy\u2026.\u201d During a rally in Iowa in January, former President Trump recalled a trade dispute he had with the French president. Contrary to most of his European counterparts, Emmanuel Macron closely interacted with Trump from 2017 to 2021, and he will undoubtedly try to leverage this experience in case of a second mandate.\n\nMacron and Trump\u2019s relationship went from apparently friendly to more confrontational and openly mutually insulting. Macron\u2019s attempt to influence Trump\u2019s position on the most contentious issues\u2014climate, the Iran nuclear deal, NATO, trade\u2014yielded few results, and it is unlikely that a newly elected Trump would prioritize cooperation with the French president after 2025.\n\nIn fact, most of the disagreements of the time would be turbo-charged in the case of a second Trump mandate. The Republican candidate has threatened to \u201cencourage Russia to do whatever they want\u201d to European allies who do not pay enough, and has previously supported the idea of withdrawing from NATO. His positions on Ukraine also appear to be in opposition to those of France, as Paris publicly supports Ukraine\u2019s accession to NATO as the best way to guarantee the future security and stability of the country.\n\nThe general use of tariffs, promised by Trump\u2019s former trade representative Robert Lighthizer, constitutes another major issue for France. The effects of a new trade war with the United States, coupled with the growing concern regarding European competitiveness, could further harm France\u2019s economic growth at a time when the country\u2019s public debt continues to grow.\n\nFinally, the indirect effects on Europe\u2019s unity may be the most challenging implications of a Trump victory for the Macron government. The messages of the Republican candidate might serve as a wakeup call for Europeans on defense, but they will more realistically lead to a general fragmentation of the continent. Faced with the threat of losing US security guarantees, each European ally would be incentivized to find its own deal with the Trump administration. Separate transactions, at the bilateral level, could become very costly for Europe. The alignment of Europe with US China policy would be one of the first conditions of such an agreement with Donald Trump, as would the increased purchase of US industrial and military capabilities. In effect, this would be the \u201cvassalization of Europe\u201d that Macron has repeatedly warned against.\n\nThe Biden Scenario\n\nAs in many other European countries, the media in France seem generally obsessed with the prospect of a Trump victory\u2014so much so that the implications of a Biden reelection are barely discussed.\n\nYet, since 2021, France has often expressed criticism of some of President Biden\u2019s decisions and policies. The AUKUS deal, negotiated by the US behind France\u2019s back and cancelling a major French industrial agreement with Australia, outraged the national strategic community, the Inflation Reduction Act was seen as \u201cunfriendly\u201d and \u201cinconsistent with the rules of the WTO\u201d, and disagreements over the Sahel led to bilateral tensions. A second Biden mandate would present new challenges.\n\nOn Ukraine, the French and US positions could grow farther apart as the war continues. The costs of the reconstruction of Ukraine, added to those related to the integration of Ukraine into the EU, could become a point of friction if the burden of Ukraine\u2019s future security falls entirely on Europe. Similarly, Biden\u2019s trade and industrial policies, as well as his reliance on tariffs, could also be an issue for a French president.\n\nThe hope in Paris, however, is that a Biden reelection would encourage allies to use the next four years to strengthen Europe\u2019s geopolitical role and capacities. Biden will put pressure on Europeans to do more, and his agenda could be an opportunity to work closely with Washington towards this objective while keeping Europe\u2019s unity. For a US administration that is committed to the transatlantic alliance, France will remain an important interlocutor in that context, and even a potential European leader on specific security issues.\n\nThe Unknown Trajectory of French Politics\n\nThe results of the US elections will be the main determinant of the future of the French-US relationship beyond 2024, but the evolution of French politics could also play a surprising role. The political fragility of the current French government and the predicted victory of the far right in the June EU Parliamentary elections could lead to instability in the coming months and years. In any case, President Macron may decide to play a more disruptive role in the bilateral relationship with the United States before he ends his mandate in 2027, especially if he considers that a Biden reelection leads to European strategic complacency.",

        "text": "Nikki Haley says she is voting Trump for president\nFormer Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley has said she plans to vote for Donald Trump, her former opponent and boss, in the 2024 US presidential election.\n\nMs Haley, who once served as Mr Trump's United Nations ambassador, was the last of his major rivals to drop out of the party primary contest, in early March.\n\nAt the time, she did not endorse him but urged him to earn the votes of the millions who had supported her.\n\nOn Wednesday, in her first public remarks since leaving the race, she said Mr Trump \"has not been perfect\", but that President Joe Biden \"has been a catastrophe\".\n\nAnti-Trump Republican voters largely coalesced behind Ms Haley's presidential bid earlier this year, and her dormant candidacy is still picking up support more than two months after she left the race.\n\nShe won more than 20% of the vote in at least two state primary elections over the past fortnight.\n\nThe Biden campaign is seeking to woo these Haley Republicans, a mix of moderate and college-educated independent voters who could help swing the election toward the Democrat. Mr Biden argues that Mr Trump has repeatedly \"made it clear he doesn't want\" voters who supported her.\n\nMr Trump, who has mocked his ex-cabinet member as a \"bird brain\", was angered by her prolonged primary challenge and recently shot down rumours that she was under consideration to be his vice-presidential running mate.\n\nSpeaking on Wednesday before a gathering at the conservative Hudson Institute think-tank in Washington DC, Ms Haley maintained the criticisms of both parties she made in her campaign.\n\nBut she reserved her strongest words for the incumbent.\n\nMr Biden, she said, oversaw a \"debacle\" in Afghanistan, \"did nothing to deter the invasion\" of Ukraine and, most recently, \"threw Israel to the wolves\".\n\n\"As a voter, I put my priorities on a president who's going to have the backs of our allies and hold our enemies to account, who would secure the border, who would support capitalism and freedom, who understands we need less debt not more debt,\" she said.\n\n\"Trump has not been perfect on these policies but Biden has been a catastrophe. So I will be voting for Trump.\"",

        "text": "Latin American voters ditch socialism for free enterprise \u2013 DW \u2013 05\nJose Raul Mulino's election victory in Panama confirms a shift in Latin America economic policies. Disenchanted with years of state intervention in the economy, voters now hope free markets will improve their lives.\n\nFollowing the recent election victories of pro-business candidates in Argentina and Ecuador, voters in Panama also chose a staunch free-market advocate as their next president in a poll held earlier this month. Jose Raul Mulino, a 64-year-old former security minister in the government, stormed to victory on the campaign slogan \"La Promesa de Chen Chen,\" meaning \"A promise of money in your pocket.\"\n\nIn November last year, far-right libertarian Javier Milei won the presidency in Argentina, vowing to \"exterminate\" rampant inflation and \"put a chainsaw to the state.\" A month earlier, banana fortune heir Daniel Noboa became Ecuador's youngest president at 35. The Harvard Kennedy School graduate focused his campaign on job creation, recommending tax exemptions and incentives for new businesses and pledging to attract more foreign investment.\n\nWhat unites all three of these newly elected presidents is the conviction that free enterprise is key to spurring growth in their economically depressed countries. Previous experiments with more socialism-oriented economic policy, modeled on the authoritarian state interventionism of Cuba and Venezuela, only intensified years of economic crisis and led to a mass exodus to the United States.\n\nMulino ran on the promise to usher in another wave of economic prosperity and to stop migration Image: DAVID TORO/EPA\n\nMulino resorts to time-tested measures\n\nIn Panama, Jose Raul Mulino was initially tapped by popular former President Ricardo Martinelli to be his running mate after Martinelli's wife declined. But then Martinelli was disqualified from running after he was sentenced to more than 10 years in prison for money laundering. Mulino took his place as the leading candidate of the Realizando Metas (RM) party.\n\nWinfried Weck from the German Konrad-Adenauer Foundation in Panama City says Mulino has adopted the economic strategy that was considered successful during the 2009-2014 Martinelli presidency.\n\n\"Mulino, like Martinelli before him, is focusing on incentivizing entrepreneurial initiatives and attracting large foreign investments. This is intended to finance and realize large infrastructure projects,\" he told DW.\n\nThese projects include building a railway connection from Panama City to David, the country's second-largest city, near the Costa Rican border. Mulino also plans to build a fourth bridge over the Panama Canal, several hospitals, new universities and possibly new metro lines for the capital.\n\n\"In a business-friendly environment for foreign investors, these plans can certainly succeed,\" Weck said. However, he added that voters will certainly judge Mulino on his central promise of \"more money in their pockets.\"\n\nEarly signs of recovery in Argentina\n\nWhile Panama's strategy might succeed, Argentina faces a more challenging path. Radical free-market proponent Javier Milei has managed to reduce monthly inflation from 25.5% in December to 8.8% in April. However, the annual rate still stands at a staggering 290%, one of the highest in the world.\n\nNevertheless, banks are again offering real-estate loans for the first time in a long while, attracting significant interest from citizens. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is also satisfied with the progress and has released another tranche of credit for Argentina.\n\nJavier Milei has become the target of mass protests after massively cutting state spending and public service jobs Image: Natacha Pisarenko/AP/picture alliance\n\nDespite Argentina's nascent recovery, Christian Hauser, a Latin America expert at the University of Applied Sciences Graub\u00fcnden, Switzerland, warns against excessive expectations. \"In Latin America, especially in Argentina, there have been recurring cycles of boom and deep economic crises, so it's crucial to wait and see how things develop,\" he told DW.\n\nFor Hauser, it is important that countries like Argentina pursue long-term economic policies with a \"regulatory framework that supports healthy competition.\" This would require promoting \"the establishment of medium-sized enterprises rather than focusing primarily on large international corporations.\" He added that the middle class is crucial for a country's economic foundation.\n\nArgentines struggle with austerity measures To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nEU-Mercosur trade deal a chance for growth\n\nIn this context, finalizing the long-negotiated trade agreement between the European Union and the Mercosur trade bloc \u2014 which includes Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay and Argentina \u2014 would be an \"important geopolitical signal,\" Weck said. \"It would signify that democratic countries and regions can agree on rules-based cooperation.\"\n\nHowever, Weck thinks reaching a trade deal after two decades of negotiations would require a willingness to compromise from both trade blocs. \"There is currently a window of opportunity that should be seized, but such opportunities have existed before,\" he cautioned.\n\nFor now, though, Latin America's three new pro-market presidents will have to wait until after next month's elections for the EU Parliament to see if Europeans will seize the opportunity to create more growth on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nThis article was originally written in German.",

        "text": "Trump-Biden Election Could Be Pivotal For The Economy And Your Wallet\nKey Takeaways Likely presidential opponents Joe Biden and Donald Trump have very different approaches to public policy, setting up a 2024 election with big implications for the economy and personal finances.\n\n\n\nThe victor in the race will preside over the expiration of many provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, deciding whether to extend or expand the bill's many tax cuts, with Trump more likely to reduce taxes for high income earners.\n\n\n\nA Biden victory would mean more student loan forgiveness, which Trump opposes. 'Junk Fees' and green energy tax credits would be among the other issues on which the candidates have opposing views.\n\n\n\nAs a presidential race between Joe Biden and Donald Trump grows more and more likely, the two candidates are promising very different approaches to public policy when it comes to money.\n\n\n\nBiden and Trump continue to move closer to their respective parties\u2019 nominations to run in the general election in November. The Republican nominee will be officially named mid-July while the Democratic nominee will be chosen a month later.\n\nThe outcome of the presidential race could have a big impact on the economy as well as household budgets. Here are some of the key issues to focus on.\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\n\nThe incoming president will have to make some of those decisions pretty much immediately. Major portions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u2014a Trump-era set of tax cuts\u2014are set to expire at the end of 2025. For instance, the top marginal tax rate for high-income earners will rise to 39.6% from 37%. The standard deduction\u2014the amount of your income that doesn\u2019t count for your federal taxes\u2014will be cut by about half. For an individual filer, it would revert to $6,500 and then be adjusted for inflation, down from $14,600 last tax season.\n\n\n\nBiden has called for repealing the TCJA tax cuts for the wealthy to reduce the budget deficit, restoring the top marginal tax rate and imposing new taxes on billionaires and people who earn more than $1 million a year.\n\n\n\nFor his part, Trump has touted the economic benefits of his administration\u2019s signature legislation and has promised \u201clower taxes\u201d on his campaign website. A Trump victory, especially if Republicans win control of Congress, would increase the chances that the TCJA\u2019s provisions for businesses and high earners would be extended.\n\nStudent Loan Forgiveness\n\nFew groups of people will face more dramatically different policies under the two candidates than student loan borrowers. Biden has supported forgiveness of federal student loans, while Trump has fiercely opposed it.\n\n\n\nNot only did Biden propose forgiving up to $20,000 for each borrower\u2014an initiative that was struck down by the Supreme Court last summer\u2014but he\u2019s changed the rules for how existing student loan forgiveness programs work, resulting in $138 billion of debt for 3.9 million borrowers being canceled as of February.\n\n\n\nTrump has taken the opposite approach. When the Supreme Court\u2019s conservative majority blocked Biden\u2019s forgiveness plan, Trump praised the ruling and said forgiveness was unfair to people who already paid off their loans.\n\n\n\nWhen Trump was last president, the Department of Education opposed efforts by students to have their student debts discharged under \u201cborrower defense\u201d rules that allow people to seek to have their loans forgiven if they were misled by the schools they attended.\n\nBiden\u2019s Campaign Against 'Junk Fees'\n\nThe election will determine whether the Biden Administration\u2019s war on what he calls \u201cjunk fees\u201d will continue. Under Biden, regulators have restricted businesses from imposing fees on customers, especially on financial products. On Tuesday, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) imposed an $8 limit on fees for late credit card payments, which currently average $32. The bureau has also proposed limiting banks from charging overdraft fees to customers who spend more money than the balances in their accounts.\n\n\n\nUnder Trump, the CFPB\u2014the government\u2019s consumer watchdog\u2014took a much more business-friendly approach, rolling back Obama-era restrictions on payday lending and taking fewer actions against debt collectors.\n\nGreen Energy Tax Credits\n\nBiden has signed laws promoting green energy, including a tax credit for buying an electric car worth up to $7,500. For his part, Trump has criticized electric vehicles and said he would put a stop to policies promoting them.\n\n\n\n\u201cNow, they want you to give you electric cars. Anybody want to drive for an hour then spend four hours to get a recharge?\u201d Trump said at a speech in Columbus, Ohio last June. \u201cFirst day in office, I\u2019ll be ending all of that.\"\n\nThe Big Economic Picture\n\nAll of these policies, and others, will have a big impact on the broader economy. In general, a Republican victory could bring lower taxes, especially on high earners and businesses, while a Democratic victory would likely bring higher taxes for those groups.\n\n\n\nRepublican governance on taxes would bring \u201csomewhat faster economic growth, higher inflation, larger budget deficits, higher Treasury yields and a steeper yield curve, all else equal,\u201d economists at Wells Fargo wrote in a research note.\n\n\n\nShould the government remain divided between the two major parties, with each controlling at least one branch of government, the tax outcome would \u201cmodestly depress the 2026 outlook for growth, inflation, government borrowing and yields,\u201d they predicted. A Democratic sweep\u2014unlikely given the Senate seats up for contention\u2014would result in tax policy that would set the economy somewhere in between the other two potential outcomes.\n\n\n\nThe election could affect the economy even before it happens. Economic research has shown that partisan conflict tends to increase during presidential election years, Ryan Sweet, chief economist at Oxford Economics, said in a research note. Historically, heightened partisan conflict\u2014resulting in standoffs and gridlock in the legislature\u2014has had a small but noticeable effect on economic growth, boosting it for a short time but decreasing it over the long run, Sweet wrote.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe initial increase in monthly GDP around the shock from political conflict could be attributed to the idea that gridlock is good for stability in fiscal policy, but over time, it becomes corrosive for the economy\u2013brinkmanship over 'must-pass' legislation unnerves consumers and businesses alike,\u201d he wrote.\n\n",

        "text": "Media Research Center\nConservative media watchdog group based in Virginia\n\nThe Media Research Center (MRC) is an American conservative content analysis and media watchdog group based in Herndon, Virginia, and founded in 1987 by L. Brent Bozell III.[2]\n\nThe nonprofit MRC has received financial support primarily from Robert Mercer,[3] but with several other conservative-leaning sources, including the Bradley, Scaife, Olin, Castle Rock and JM foundations, as well as ExxonMobil.[4][5][6] It has been described as \"one of the most active and best-funded, and yet least known\" arms of the modern conservative movement in the United States.[7] The organization rejects the scientific consensus on climate change and criticizes media coverage that reflects the scientific consensus.[5][8]\n\nFoundation and funding [ edit ]\n\nL. Brent Bozell III founded the Media Research Center in 1987.\n\nBozell and a group of other American conservatives founded MRC on October 1, 1987. Their initial budget was at US$339,000.[9] Prior to founding the MRC, Bozell was the chairman of the National Conservative Political Action Committee; he resigned from that position a month before establishing MRC.[10] A wealthy donor whose name has been kept anonymous helped set up the MRC.[11] The MRC has received financial support from several foundations, including the Bradley, Scaife, Olin, Castle Rock, Carthage and JM foundations.[4] It also receives funding from ExxonMobil. The organization rejects the scientific consensus on climate change and criticizes media coverage that reflects the scientific consensus.[5][6][8] The MRC received over $10 million from Robert Mercer, its largest single donor.[3]\n\nAs of its 2015 reporting to the IRS, the organization had revenue approaching $15 million and expenses in excess of $15 million. Bozell's salary during this year was reported as close to $345,000, with nearly $122,000 in additional compensation from the organization and related organizations.[12]\n\nProjects [ edit ]\n\nReports on news media [ edit ]\n\nOriginal logo of the Media Research Center from 1987 to 2012.\n\nFrom 1996 to 2009, the MRC published a daily online newsletter called CyberAlert written by editor Brent Baker. Each issue profiles what he perceives as biased or inaccurate reports about politics in the American news media.[13] Prior to CyberAlert, MRC published such reports in a monthly newsletter titled MediaWatch,[14] from 1988 to 1999.[15] Media analysis articles are now under the banner BiasAlert.[16] Media analysis director Tim Graham and research director Rich Noyes regularly write Media Reality Check, another MRC publication documenting alleged liberal bias.[17] Notable Quotables is its \"collection of the most biased quotes from journalists\".[9] In Notable Quotables, editors give honors such as the \"Linda Ellerbee Awards for Distinguished Reporting\" based on the former CNN commentator, who Bozell considered \"a liberal blowhard who has nothing to say\".[18] Other features on its website include the weekly syndicated news and entertainment columns written by founder Bozell.\n\nMRC staff members have also written editorials and books about their findings of the media. Bozell has written three books about the news media: And That's the Way it Isn't: A Reference Guide to Media Bias (1990, with Brent Baker); Weapons of Mass Distortion: The Coming Meltdown of the Liberal Media (2004); and Whitewash: How The News Media Are Paving Hillary Clinton's Path to the Presidency (2007, with Tim Graham). Research director Rich Noyes has also co-authored several published books.[19]\n\nMRC Business [ edit ]\n\nIn 1992, the MRC created the Free Market Project to promote the culture of free enterprise and combat what it believes is media spin on business and economic news. That division recently[when?] changed its name to the Business & Media Institute (www.businessandmedia.org) and later to MRC Business and is now focused on \"Advancing the culture of free enterprise in America.\" BMI's advisory board included such well-known individuals as economists Walter Williams and Bruce Bartlett, as well as former CNN anchor David Goodnow. BMI is led by career journalist Dan Gainor, a former managing editor at CQ.com, the website for Congressional Quarterly. It released a research report in June 2006 covering the portrayal of business on prime-time entertainment television during the May and November \"sweeps\" periods from 2005. The report concluded that the programs, among them the long running NBC legal drama Law & Order, were biased against business.[20] Another report of the BMI accused the networks of bias in favor of the Gardasil vaccine, a vaccine intended to prevent cervical cancer.\n\nCNSNews [ edit ]\n\nBozell founded CNSNews (formerly Cybercast News Service) in 1998 to cover stories he believes are ignored by mainstream news organizations.[21] CNSNews.com provides news articles for Townhall.com and other websites for a subscription fee. Its leadership consists of president Brent Bozell and editor Terry Jeffrey. Under editor David Thibault, CNSNews.com questioned the validity of the circumstances in which Democratic Rep. John Murtha received his Purple Hearts as a response to Murtha's criticisms of the U.S. War in Iraq. The Washington Post and Nancy Pelosi have commented that this approach is similar to the tactics of the Swift Vets and POWs for Truth, which opposed John Kerry's candidacy in the 2004 election.[22]\n\nNewsBusters [ edit ]\n\nIn the summer of 2005, Media Research Center launched NewsBusters, a website \"dedicated to exposing & combating liberal media bias,\" in cooperation with Matthew Sheffield, a now-former conservative blogger (who now works at Salon.com) involved in the CBS Killian documents story. NewsBusters is styled as a rapid-response blog site that contains posts by MRC editors to selected stories in mass media.[23] Although the site is advertised chiefly as a conservative site, it frequently defends neoconservatives as well.[24] The site highlights journalists and non-journalists (writers, musicians, producers, scientists, etc.) perceived as having liberal viewpoints.[25][26][27][28]\n\nResearch on entertainment [ edit ]\n\nThe MRC has produced research and analysis on the entertainment industry, as well. In May 1989, the MRC began publishing the newsletter TV, etc. Its mission, said Bozell in a 1992 lecture at The Heritage Foundation, was to \"document the left-wing antics within the entertainment industry\".[29] TV, etc. attracted immediate attention in entertainment circles. As noted by Broadcasting magazine, the debut issue of TV, etc. was critical of primetime TV shows like The Golden Girls, Head of the Class, and thirtysomething for containing storylines or dialogue believed to be hostile to conservatives.[30] Then at its annual convention in July 1989, the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists passed a resolution criticizing the MRC's newsletter.[31]\n\nA 1990 issue of TV, etc. published lyrics to the Todd Rundgren song \"Jesse\" that attacked Jesse Helms, Tipper Gore, and Pope John Paul II; Bozell also wrote to Warner Bros. Records urging the label not to include the song in Rundgren's upcoming album.[32]\n\nTV, etc. also released annual lists of programs it deemed the \"most biased\". For the 1991\u201392 season, The Trials of Rosie O'Neill made the top of that list; other shows ranked included Captain Planet and the Planeteers, L.A. Law, and The Simpsons.[33]\n\nIn 1993, Bozell wrote a letter to NBC in support of its show Against the Grain as the show was struggling in ratings. Bozell praised Against the Grain for \"staunch advocacy of education and gentle, respectful treatment of family life.\"[34]\n\nFollowing the 1994\u201395 television season, TV, etc. named the NBC made-for-TV movie Serving in Silence: The Margarethe Cammermeyer Story the most biased program of the season; others included Roseanne and The X-Files.[35] Then in 1995, Bozell founded the Parents Television Council, with a focus on combatting indecency on television.[36]\n\nIn October 2006, the MRC created the Culture and Media Institute, the mission of which is \"to advance, preserve, and help restore America's culture, character, traditional values, and morals against the assault of the liberal media.\"[37] Robert H. Knight was the institute's first director. MRC VP Dan Gainor is now in charge of that department.\n\nThe CMI promoted its mission through editorials and research reports. In March 2007, the CMI published a \"National Cultural Values Survey\" and concluded from its results that most Americans perceived a decline in moral values.[38] One study released by the organization in June 2007 claimed that television viewing time correlated directly with one's liberal attitude, even possibly degrading to moral attitudes.[39] In 2008, it published a report detailing its opposition to reinstatement of the FCC fairness doctrine, a policy requiring broadcasters to present differing views on controversial issues of public import. The MRC claims the rule had been politically weaponized by the Kennedy and Johnson administrations to suppress conservative radio, before being abolished by a bipartisan FCC in 1987.[40]\n\nThe CBS crime drama Cold Case has been twice criticized by the CMI for alleged anti-Christian prejudice in two episodes.[41] In May 2008, CMI released another report, one that claimed a moral decline in \"Dear Abby\" columns.[42][43] The CMI website remained online through the end of 2010,[44] before it was folded in the Media Research Center website in 2011.[45] In November 2014, the MRC renamed the institute MRC Culture.[46]\n\nOthers [ edit ]\n\nMRC sponsors MRCTV (formerly Eyeblast),[47] a conservative-leaning YouTube-like video-hosting site.[48]\n\nIn 2018, the MRC started a new project in the Culture Department to monitor online censorship of conservatives called MRC TechWatch.\n\nBrent Bozell ghostwriting [ edit ]\n\nIn February 2014, former employees of the Media Research Center alleged that the center's founder L. Brent Bozell III does not write his own columns or books and instead has used a ghostwriter, Tim Graham, for years.[49]\n\n\"Employees at the MRC were never under any illusion that Bozell had been writing his own copy. 'It's an open secret at the office that Graham writes Bozell's columns, and has done so for years,' said one former employee. In fact, a former MRC employee went so far as to tell The Daily Beast, 'I know for a fact that Bozell didn't even read any of the drafts of his latest book until after it had been sent to the publishers,' The Daily Beast reported.\"[50]\n\nOne newspaper, the Quad-City Times in Davenport, Iowa, dropped Bozell's column as a result, saying, \"Bozell may have been comfortable representing others' work as his own. We're not. The latest disclosure convinces us Bozell has no place on our print or web pages.\"[51]\n\nViewpoints [ edit ]\n\nIn 2018, the Media Research Center criticized journalist Katy Tur for introducing the issue of climate change into reporting on Hurricane Florence, while its director of media analysis bemoaned what he described as the use of \"spin\" to politicize media coverage of natural disasters.[52] In 2017, MRC sponsored a conference by the Heartland Institute, an organization known for its effort to cast doubt about the scientific consensus on climate change.[53] In November 2021, a study by the Center for Countering Digital Hate described Media Research Center as being among \"ten fringe publishers\" that together were responsible for nearly 70 percent of Facebook user interactions with content that denied climate change. Facebook disputed the study's methodology.[54][55]\n\nIn 2002, MRC said CNN was \"[Fidel] Castro's megaphone\".[56] In 1999, the MRC said that network news programs on ABC, CBS, and NBC largely ignored Chinese espionage in the United States during the Clinton administration.[57]\n\nIn MRC reports released from 1993 to 1995, it was claimed that such programs made more references to religion each later year, most of which became more favorable.[58] In 2003, the MRC urged advertisers to pull sponsorship from The Reagans, a miniseries about President Ronald Reagan to be shown on CBS. The network later moved the program to its co-owned premium cable network Showtime.[59]\n\nThe MRC has been a critic of the video game industry, arguing that there is a link between violent videogames and real-world violence; in this capacity, they (along with the Parents Television Council, a subsidiary) were invited to President Donald Trump's 2018 summit on video games and gun violence.[60][61]\n\nMRC released a report in 2007 claiming that the network morning shows devoted more airtime to covering Democratic presidential candidates than Republican ones for the 2008 election. Producers for such shows criticized the MRC's methodology as flawed.[62] During the 2008 US presidential election, MRC claimed that the vast majority of news stories about Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama had a positive slant.[63] MRC president Bozell praised MSNBC for having David Gregory replace Chris Matthews and Keith Olbermann as political coverage anchor beginning September 8, 2008, but MSNBC president Phil Griffin disputed the statements by Bozell and others who have accused the network of liberal bias.[64]\n\nThoughtCo named MRC one of the top 15 conservatives to follow on Twitter.[65]\n\nBozell was an outspoken critic of Donald Trump during the 2016 Republican primaries, describing him as \"the greatest charlatan of them all\", \"a \"huckster\" and \"shameless self-promoter\".[11] He said, \"God help this country if this man were president.\"[11] After Trump clinched the Republican nomination, Bozell attacked the media for their \"hatred\" of Trump.[11] Politico noted, \"The paradox here is that Bozell was once more antagonistic toward the president than any journalist.\"[11] Bozell singled out Jake Tapper for being \"one of the worst offenders\" in coverage of Trump. However, several senior MRC staff told Politico that they considered Tapper a model of fairness,[11] although that viewpoint has since changed.\n\nCriticism [ edit ]\n\nExtra!, the magazine of the progressive media watch group FAIR, criticized the MRC in 1998 for selective use of evidence. MRC had said that there was more coverage of government death squads in right-wing El Salvador than in left-wing Nicaragua in the 1980s, when Amnesty International stated El Salvador was worse than Nicaragua when it came to extrajudicial killings. Extra! also likened a defunct MRC newsletter, TV etc., which tracked the off-screen political comments of actors, to \"Red Channels, the McCarthy Era blacklisting journal.\"[66]\n\nJournalist Brian Montopoli of Columbia Journalism Review in 2005 labeled MRC \"just one part of a wider movement by the far right to demonize corporate media\", rather than \"make the media better.\"[67]\n\nOn December 22, 2011, Media Research Center president Bozell appeared on Fox News and suggested U.S. president Barack Obama looks like a \"skinny ghetto crackhead\".[68]\n\nThe Media Research Center has also faced scrutiny over the group's $350,000 purchase in 2012 of a Pennsylvania house that a top executive had been trying to sell for several years.[69]\n\nIn 2013, Media Research Center president Bozell appeared on Fox News to defend a Fox interview in which Fox journalists conducted almost no research into the background of Reza Aslan to prepare for its interview with him, and its putative biases.[70]\n\nWhen the Media Research Center bestowed an award named for William F. Buckley to Sean Hannity, Bret Stephens, a neoconservative columnist for The New York Times, wrote an editorial in which he lamented, \"And so we reach the Idiot stage of the conservative cycle, in which a Buckley Award for Sean Hannity suggests nothing ironic, much less Orwellian, to those bestowing it, applauding it, or even shrugging it off. The award itself is trivial, but it's a fresh reminder of who now holds the commanding heights of conservative life, and what it is that they think.\"[71]\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]",

        "text": "John Hagelin\nAmerican politic, former physicist, and transcendental meditation advocate\n\nJohn Samuel Hagelin ( ;[1] born June 9, 1954) is a physicist and the leader of the Transcendental Meditation (TM) movement in the United States. He is president of Maharishi International University (MIU), formerly Maharishi University of Management (MUM), in Fairfield, Iowa, and honorary chair of its board of trustees.[2][3] The university was established in 1973 by the TM movement's founder, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, to deliver a \"consciousness-based education\".[4] Hagelin's work and research connected to TM has attracted criticism from former colleagues and fellow scientists.[5][6][7]\n\nIn 1981, Hagelin graduated with a Ph.D. in physics from Harvard University and then did several months of post-doctoral research at CERN. He went on to do post-doctoral work at the SLAC. In 1984, he became a professor of physics at Maharishi International University (MIU), and later became the university's president.[8] Hagelin postulates that his extended version of unified field theory is identified with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's \"unified field of consciousness\", a view that was rejected by \"virtually every theoretical physicist in the world\" in 2006.\n\nHagelin stood as a candidate for President of the United States for the Natural Law Party, a party founded by the TM movement, in the 1992, 1996 and 2000 elections.[10] He is the author of Manual for a Perfect Government (1998), which sets out how to apply \"natural law\" to matters of governance. Hagelin is also the president of the David Lynch Foundation, which promotes TM.[11]\n\nEarly life and education [ edit ]\n\nHagelin was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the second of four sons, to Mary Lee Hagelin (n\u00e9e Stephenson), a schoolteacher, and Carl William Hagelin, a businessman.[12][13] He was raised in Connecticut and won a scholarship to the Taft School for boys in Watertown. In July 1970, while at Taft, he was involved in a motorcycle crash that led to a long stay\u2014in a body cast\u2014in the school infirmary. During his time there, he began reading about quantum mechanics but was also introduced to TM by a practitioner, Rick Archer, who had been invited to the school to talk about the meditation form.[15][16]\n\nAfter Taft, Hagelin attended Dartmouth College. At the end of his freshman year, he studied TM in Vittel, France, and returned as a qualified TM teacher.[15] In 1975, he obtained his A.B. in physics with highest honors (summa cum laude) from Dartmouth.[17] He went on to study physics at Harvard University under Howard Georgi, earning a master's degree in 1976 and a Ph.D. in 1981.[15] By the time he had received his Ph.D., he had published several papers on particle theory.[18]\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\nAcademic positions [ edit ]\n\nIn 1981, Hagelin became a postdoctoral researcher for a few months at the European Center for Particle Physics (CERN) in Switzerland, and in 1982, he moved to the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) in California.[15] He left SLAC in 1983, reportedly because of personal problems. A year later, he joined Maharishi International University (MIU) as chair of the physics department.[5][6][19] Two of Hagelin's previous collaborators, Dimitri Nanopoulos and John Ellis, were uncomfortable with his move to MIU, but they continued to work with him.[20] While at MIU, Hagelin received funding from the National Science Foundation.[15]\n\nHagelin became a trustee of MUM and, in 2016, its president.[3] It was intended that he become president of Maharishi Central University, which was under construction in Smith Center, Kansas, until early 2008, when, according to Hagelin, the project was put on hold while the TM organization dealt with the death of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.[21]\n\nKilby International Award [ edit ]\n\nIn 1992, Hagelin received a Kilby International Award from the North Dallas Chamber of Commerce \"for his promising work in particle physics in the development of supersymmetric grand unified field theory\".[22] According to a member of the selection committee, Hagelin's nomination was proposed by another selection-committee member who was a fellow TM practitioner.[23][24] Chris Anderson, in a 1992 Nature article about Hagelin's first presidential campaign, questioned the value of the award.[23]\n\nTheoretical physics [ edit ]\n\nDuring his time at CERN, SLAC and MUM, Hagelin worked on supersymmetric extensions of the standard model and grand unification theories.[18] His work on the flipped SU(5) heterotic superstring theory is considered one of the more successful unified field theories, or \"theories of everything\",[23] and was highlighted in 1991 in a cover story in Discover magazine.[20]\n\nFrom 1979 to 1996, Hagelin published over 70 papers about particle physics, electroweak unification, grand unification, supersymmetry and cosmology, most of them in academic scientific journals.[18] He co-authored a 1983 paper in Physics Letters B, \"Weak symmetry breaking by radiative corrections in broken supergravity\", that became one of the 103 most-cited articles in the physical sciences in 1983 and 1984.[25][26] In a 2012 interview in Science Watch, co-author Keith Olive said that his work for the 1984 study was one of the areas that had given him the greatest sense of accomplishment.[27] A 1984 paper by Hagelin and John Ellis in Nuclear Physics B, \"Supersymmetric relics from the big bang\", had been cited over 500 times by 2007.[28]\n\nMaharishi effect [ edit ]\n\nIn the summer of 1993, Hagelin directed a project aimed at demonstrating what TM practitioners call the Maharishi effect, the purported ability of a large group to affect the behavior of others by practising TM.[29] The TM movement believes that one tenth of the square root of the population of a country meditating can bring about peace.[30] However, critics point to a lack of credible supporting evidence.[5]\n\nApproximately 4,000 people from 82 countries gathered in Washington, DC, and practiced TM for six hours a day from June 7 to July 30. The meditation included \"yogic flying\", a technique taught through the TM-Sidhi program in which practitioners engage in a series of hops while seated in the lotus position. Hagelin claimed that there was a local reduction in crime due to this activity.[29][31]\n\nAccording to Hagelin, the analysis was examined by an \"independent review board\", although all members of the board were TM practitioners. Robert L. Park, research professor and former chair of the physics department at the University of Maryland, called the study a \"clinic in data distortion\".[5] In 1994, a science satire magazine, Annals of Improbable Research, \"awarded\" Hagelin the Ig Nobel Prize for Peace, \"for his experimental conclusion that 4,000 trained meditators caused an 18 percent decrease in violent crime in Washington, D.C.\"[32][33]\n\nIn 1999, Hagelin held a press conference in Washington, D.C. to announce that the TM movement could end the Kosovo War with yogic flying. He suggested that NATO set up an elite corps of 7,000 yogic flyers at a cost of $33 million.[6][34]\n\nEnlightened Audio Designs Corporation [ edit ]\n\nIn 1990, Hagelin founded Enlightened Audio Designs Corporation (EAD) with Alastair Roxburgh.[35] The company designed and manufactured high-end digital-to-analog converters.[36] EAD was sold in 2001 to Alpha Digital Technologies in Oregon.[35]\n\nPolitics [ edit ]\n\nNatural Law Party [ edit ]\n\nHagelin and 12 others founded the Natural Law Party in April 1992 in Fairfeld, based on the view that problems of governance could be solved more effectively by following \"natural law\", the organizing principle of the universe.[17][37] The party platform included preventive health care, sustainable agriculture and renewable energy technologies. Hagelin favored abortion rights without public financing, campaign-finance law reform, more restrictive gun control, and a flat tax, with no tax for families earning less than $34,000 per year.[38] He campaigned to eradicate PACs and soft money campaign contributions and advocated safety locks on guns, school vouchers, and efforts to prevent war in the Middle East by reducing \"people's tension\".[39]\n\nThe party chose Hagelin and Mike Tompkins as its presidential and vice-presidential candidates in 1992 and 1996.[40] Hagelin received 39,212 votes from 32 states in 1992 (and 23 percent of the vote in Jefferson County, where MIU is located), and 113,659 votes from 43 states in 1996 (21 percent in Jefferson County).[41][42][43]\n\nHagelin ran for president again in 2000, nominated both by the NLP and by the Perot wing of the Reform Party, which disputed the nomination of Pat Buchanan.[44][45] Hagelin's running mate was Nat Goldhaber. A dispute over the Reform Party's nomination generated legal action between the Hagelin and Buchanan campaigns. In September 2000, the Federal Election Commission ruled that Buchanan was the official candidate of the Reform Party and hence eligible to receive federal election funds.[38][46] The Reform Party convention that nominated Hagelin was declared invalid.[47] In spite of the ruling, Hagelin remained on several state ballots as the Reform Party nominee because of the independent nature of some state affiliates; he was also the national nominee of the Natural Law Party, and in New York was the Independence Party nominee.[46] He received 83,714 votes from 39 states.[48] During the 2004 primary elections, Hagelin endorsed Democratic candidate Dennis Kucinich,[49] and in April that year the Executive Committee of the NLP dissolved the NLP as a national organization.[50]\n\nInstitute of Science, Technology and Public Policy [ edit ]\n\nHagelin is the director of the Institute of Science, Technology and Public Policy (ISTPP), an MIU think tank.[51] According to the ISTPP's website, he has met with members of Congress and officials at the Department of State and Department of Defense to discuss terrorism.[52][53] In 1993, he helped draft a paragraph in Hillary Rodham Clinton's 10,000-page health care plan; according to Hagelin, his was the only paragraph that addressed preventive health care.[54] In 1998, the ISTPP testified about germ-line technologies to the DNA Advisory Committee of the National Institutes of Health; Hagelin's report to the committee said that \"recombinant DNA technology is inherently risky because of the high probability of unexpected side-effects\".[55][56]\n\nOther organizations [ edit ]\n\nHagelin in 2009\n\nHagelin established the US Peace Government (USPG) in July 2003 as an affiliate of the Global Country of World Peace and served as the latter's minister of science and technology. According to USPG's website, the TM movement created US Peace Government and the Global Country of World Peace to promote evidence-based, sustainable problem-solving and governance policies that align with \"natural law\".[58]\n\nMaharishi Mahesh Yogi appointed Hagelin the \"Raja of Invincible America\" in November 2007. Hagelin organized the Invincible America Assembly in Fairfield in July 2006. The assembly comprised individuals practicing TM and TM-Sidhi techniques twice daily. Hagelin predicted that as the number of Yogic flyers increased towards 3500, \"[p]eace and prosperity will reign [in America], and violence and conflict will subside completely\".[59][60] In July 2007, he said that the assembly was responsible for the Dow Jones Industrial Average reaching a record high of 14,022 and predicted that it would top 17,000 within a year.[61][62]\n\nHagelin is also president of the Global Union of Scientists for Peace, an organization of scientists opposed to nuclear proliferation and war,[63] and president of the David Lynch Foundation, which promotes TM.[11]\n\nCriticism [ edit ]\n\nHagelin and the credibility of his work have received criticism throughout the years. Hagelin's former academic peers \"ostracized him\" for combining science with a \"form of Hinduism that doesn't acknowledge its roots\".[6] Neuroscientist and meditation researcher David Vago states that all of Hagelin's Maharishi Effect studies are \"correlation without causation\" and Dennis Roark, former chairman of the physics department at MIU, derided Hagelin's research as \"crackpot science\".[7] In 1994, Hagelin was award the satirical Ig Nobel Prize for his experiment of yogic flyers and crime rate as the \"silliest scientific studies of the year\".[7]\n\nEfforts to link consciousness to the unified field [ edit ]\n\nIn a 1992 news article for Nature about Hagelin's first presidential campaign, Chris Anderson wrote that Hagelin was \"by all accounts a gifted scientist, well-known and respected by his colleagues\", but that his effort to link the flipped SU(5) unified field theory to TM \"infuriates his former collaborators\", who feared it might taint their own work and requests for funding. John Ellis, then director of CERN's department of theoretical physics\u2014who worked with Hagelin on SU(5)\u2014reportedly asked Hagelin to stop comparing it to TM. Anderson wrote that two-page advertisements containing rows of partial differential equations had been appearing in the U.S. media, purporting to show how TM affected distant events.[23] In his book, Not Even Wrong: The Failure of String Theory and The Search for Unity In Physical Law (2007), the physicist Peter Woit wrote that identification of a unified field of consciousness with a unified field of superstring theory was wishful thinking, and that \"[v]irtually every theoretical physicist in the world rejects all of this as nonsense and the work of a crackpot\".[18]\n\nPhilosopher Evan Fales and sociologist Barry Markovsky remarked that, because no such phenomena have been validated, Hagelin's \"far-fetched explanation lacks purpose\". They went on to say that the parallels Hagelin highlighted rest on ambiguity, obscurity and vague analogy, supported by the construction of arbitrary similarities.[64]\n\nHagelin was featured in the movies What the Bleep Do We Know!? (2004) and The Secret (2006).[65][66] Jo\u00e3o Magueijo, professor of theoretical physics at Imperial College London, described What the Bleep Do We Know!? as \"horrendously tedious\", consisting of deliberate misrepresention of science and \"ludicrous extrapolations\".[65][67]\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nHagelin's first marriage, to Margaret Hagelin, ended in divorce.[54] He married Kara Anastasio, the former vice-chair of the Natural Law Party of Ohio, in 2010.[68][69]\n\nSelected works [ edit ]",

        "text": "US-German Relations After the US Election\nUkraine is the European country with the most at stake in the outcome of the US elections in November, but Germany is a strong second. Concern over the consequences of a second term for Donald Trump is shared across Berlin, no less in the conservative opposition party than among the three governing parties. The only outlier is Germany\u2019s far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) Party. In Trump\u2019s first term, Germany and its chancellor at the time, Angela Merkel, were often the targets of the president\u2019s ire and attacks. The main points of contention for Trump\u2014the United States\u2019 substantial trade deficit with Germany, Germany\u2019s insufficient defense spending, and its global economic policies\u2014have not fundamentally changed since 2020. Furthermore, the statements Trump has already made about policy plans, including proposed tariffs, would be painful for Germany. But on the economic front, Berlin has also had its challenges with the Biden administration and \u201cBidenomics\u201d.\n\nDespite displeasure about economic policies that are viewed in Berlin as protectionist, for Germany a second Biden term would be met with relief. Chancellor Scholz has made a point of closely aligning himself with Biden, especially on Ukraine. Berlin\u2019s government and main opposition party are openly thankful for the Biden administration\u2019s decisive leadership in the early months of Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine. In 2024, a broad consensus has emerged in Germany that Europe needs to take on a bigger share of the burden for European defense and security (aided in part by the long delay in the US funding package that was finally passed in April). The chances that this realization will result in a big step forward in European security and defense capabilities and cooperation are still not high, as the EU and domestic politics are still challenging, but this is the central opportunity of a second Biden term. With a supportive nudge from a re-elected Biden, perhaps Germany and its EU partners in NATO can finally make a common security breakthrough. If not, the unsustainable status quo for Ukraine and for NATO is at least better than the alternative.\n\nBerlin\u2019s worries about a second Biden term are in the economic realm. As a Social Democrat, Olaf Scholz may ideologically concur with Biden\u2019s \u201cForeign Policy for the Middle Class\u201d, but its costs for German businesses are a point of strife between the transatlantic partners. Germany\u2019s political and business classes still hope to save the multilateral free-trade order and expect difficulties from Washington even if Biden holds the White House. Berlin may also face increasing pressure from Washington to add more of a security lens to its economic relations with China.\n\nA second term for Donald Trump is viewed with foreboding in Berlin. The Institute for German Business (IW) has estimated that a Trump victory will bring economic costs for Germany of up to \u20ac150 billion, based on the blanket tariffs Trump has promised as well as the general slowdown of an expected escalation in the US-China trade battle. There are significant risks in the realm of politics and security as well. Under Trump, US support for Ukraine would likely drop rapidly and steeply. Germany and Europe are not prepared to fill the gap. Berlin further worries that European countries would focus on bilateral security relations with the Trump administration, with Germany poorly positioned to compete. Though Scholz may receive less direct rancor from Trump than Merkel did (since he is not a woman and is not associated with generous immigration policies) there are prominent figures in Trump\u2019s orbit who are outspoken critics of Germany, most prominently Richard Grenell, who served as ambassador to Berlin in 2018\u20132020 and is considered a likely Trump pick for Secretary of State.\n\nBerlin has been slow to prepare for a potential second Trump term. Efforts are underway to forge connections to those who might be influential in Trump circles. Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock made a noteworthy visit to Texas last year, for example, where she met with governor and Trump favorite Greg Abbott. As it is often unclear who may end up in Trump\u2019s inner circle, German politicians are building contacts with Republicans in Congress and state-level government as well as with influential conservatives in the business arena.\n\nNumerous scenarios are being gamed out to try to plot pressure points and possible responses. But instead of planning possible responses to moves from Washington, Berlin should develop a proactive plan\u2014ideally one developed with and supported by at least some of its EU partners. Since there is now political consensus among Berlin\u2019s mainstream parties that Germany needs to take on greater responsibility for European security\u2014as exemplified by Defense Minister Pistorius\u2019 May 9 speech\u2014now would be the time to create a serious capacity-increasing plan, with targets and benchmarks, for a stronger EU pillar in NATO. Such a plan can be devised in a way that it would look like a significant political victory for the next US president, which will be especially important if his name is Trump. But even if Biden wins in November, Germany and its European partners should have their own strategic vision for putting the transatlantic relationship on a more secure footing while they have an ally in the White House.\n\nEither way, Berlin will be in a stronger negotiating position if it comes to the table with some ideas and offers of its own.",

        "text": "Road to the 2024 US Presidential Election: Memorial Day Update\nThe United States is nearly five months away from a presidential election that continues to defy historical norms. President Joe Biden has the lowest level of support of any incumbent in modern history. His opponent, former President Donald Trump, is currently on trial in New York facing 34 felony counts.\n\nOverview\n\nDespite the unprecedented factors shaping the presidential election, as well as the volatility at home and abroad, the standing in the race between the two candidates has remained relatively static over the past six months, with Trump maintaining a narrow but consistent lead nationally. More importantly, in the pursuit of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the election, Trump also holds clear leads in four of the six battleground states that will likely determine the outcome in November, according to Cook Political Report.\n\nIn Congress, Republicans are favored to take control of the Senate. Democrats have all but lost West Virginia following Senator Joe Manchin\u2019s decision not to seek reelection, and they are defending seven additional seats that are currently considered competitive by Cook Political Report. None of the Republican-held seats in the Senate that are up for reelection in 2024 are considered at risk. Control of the House is considered a toss-up, with Republicans defending 22 competitive seats and the Democrats defending 24 competitive seats.\n\nThe outcomes of these elections carry tremendous policy and regulatory implications. Emboldened by reelection, Biden would likely use executive action to expand on his first-term signature policy wins, particularly in areas like energy, financial services and healthcare. Executives should expect that in a second term, Biden and his team would double down on their efforts to expand the country\u2019s infrastructure and green manufacturing capabilities, as laid out in the Inflation Reduction Act and other key policies.\n\nShould Trump return to the White House, he would likely seek to dismantle many of Biden\u2019s signature achievements while preserving protectionist policies such as tariffs on goods from China and efforts to further promote American manufacturing and \u201creshoring.\u201d Trump would likely try to preserve key elements of his signature Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that are scheduled to sunset in 2025. His administration would also likely move to deregulate several industries and advance efforts to eliminate civil service protections for some in the federal bureaucracy.\n\nDespite what hangs in the balance, this is the first presidential election in contemporary American politics that is more squarely about the past than the future. As a result, each candidate is not campaigning on his proposals going forward but rather on relitigating his prior record. This focus will be the defining element of each campaign in the months leading up to election day.",

In a five-way contest including Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Jill Stein and Cornel West, Trump receives 40%, Biden 37%, Kennedy 17% and Stein and West 3% each.\n\nAmong likely voters Trump receives 51% and Biden 49% in the two-candidate choice. In the five-candidate race Trump has 44%, Biden 41%, Kennedy 11%, and Stein and West 2% each, among likely voters.\n\nIn a March 2024 Marquette Law School Poll national survey, the two-candidate race was also tied at 50% while in the five-candidate measure Trump had 41%, Biden 38%, Kennedy 14%, Stein 2% and West 5%, among registered voters.\n\nThe survey was conducted May 6-15, 2024, interviewing 902 registered voters nationwide, with a margin of error of +/-4.6 percentage points. For likely voters, the sample size is 684, with a margin of error of +/-5.2 percentage points. Overall, the poll surveyed 1,033 adults and has a margin of error of +/-4.3 percentage points.\n\nTrump New York trial\n\nTrump\u2019s trial in New York on charges he falsified business records to cover up payments to adult film actress Stormy Daniels was ongoing during the poll\u2019s field period. Sixty-five percent of those polled said they had heard a lot about the trial, while 28% had heard a little and 7% had heard nothing at all.\n\nWhile most interviews were conducted during the week of Daniels\u2019 testimony and before that of Michael Cohen, 54% said they think Trump did something illegal, 27% said he did something wrong but not illegal, and 19% said he did nothing wrong.\n\nProspective jurors in the New York case were asked to complete a questionnaire, including an item asking: \u201cCan you give us your assurance that you will decide this case solely on the evidence you see and hear in this courtroom and the law as the judge gives it?\u201d We asked our national sample of registered voters that same question. Seventy-nine percent said they could decide solely on the evidence and the law, while 11% said they could not and 9% said they didn\u2019t know. Republicans and Democrats were equally likely to say they could decide solely on the evidence, with 80% of each saying that.\n\nTo test the possible effect of the outcome of the trial, we asked half the sample:\n\nIf it turns out that Donald Trump is found guilty in his New York trial, would you vote for Joe Biden or for Donald Trump?\n\nAnd for the other half sample we asked:\n\nIf it turns out that Donald Trump is found not guilty in his New York trial, would you vote for Joe Biden or for Donald Trump?\n\nFor those respondents presented with the guilty scenario, Biden had a 4-percentage point advantage over Trump, 43%-39% with 18% for someone else or not voting. For those presented with the not-guilty scenario, Trump had a 6-point advantage over Biden, 44%-38% with 18% for someone else or not voting.\n\nTrends in vote choice\n\nThe trend in vote choice for the two-candidate race is shown in Table 1 since May 2023. The margin has been small in most polls over this time with a tie in the last two polls.\n\nTable 1: Presidential vote choice, Biden vs. Trump, May 2023-May 2024\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nPoll dates Vote Joe Biden Donald Trump 5/6-15/24 50 50 3/18-28/24 50 50 2/5-15/24 49 51 11/2-7/23 48 52 9/18-25/23 48 51 7/7-12/23 50 50 5/8-18/23 47 52 Marquette Law School Poll, national surveys, latest: May 6-15, 2024 Question: If the 2024 election for president were held today between former President Donald Trump, the Republican, and President Joe Biden, the Democrat, would you vote for Donald Trump or for Joe Biden? Question: If you had to choose, would you vote for Trump or for Biden?\n\nTable 2 shows the Biden vs. Trump two-candidate results by party identification from February to May. Both candidates have drawn around 90% support among voters identifying with the candidate\u2019s party, while independents have favored Biden in the last two surveys.\n\nTable 2: Vote for Biden or Trump, by party identification\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nParty ID Vote choice Joe Biden Donald Trump 5/6-15/24 Republican 6 94 Independent 57 43 Democrat 90 10 3/18-28/24 Republican 12 88 Independent 53 46 Democrat 93 7 2/5-15/24 Republican 7 93 Independent 43 54 Democrat 91 9 Marquette Law School Poll, national surveys, February 5-15, 2024, March 18-28, 2024, and May 6-15, 2024 Question: If the 2024 election for president were held today between former President Donald Trump, the Republican, and President Joe Biden, the Democrat, would you vote for Donald Trump or for Joe Biden?

Kennedy Jr, independent Cornel West, or the Green Party\u2019s Jill Stein?\n\nThe five-way vote is shown by party in Table 4. The additional candidates draw partisan support away from both Trump and Biden. Kennedy takes 15% from Republicans and 16% from Democrats. Stein and West draw 4% and 5% respectively from Democrats but only 1% each from Republicans.\n\nTable 4: Five-candidate ballot, by party identification\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nParty ID Vote choice Biden Trump Kennedy Stein West 5/6-15/24 Republican 3 80 15 1 1 Independent 29 15 39 8 10 Democrat 71 4 16 4 5 3/18-28/24 Republican 7 77 12 0 4 Independent 20 20 37 7 15 Democrat 76 5 12 4 3 2/5-15/24 Republican 4 80 15 1 0 Independent 18 34 29 4 13 Democrat 78 5 12 2 4 Marquette Law School Poll, national surveys, latest: May 6-15, 2024 Question: If the presidential ballot included additional candidates, would you vote for Democrat Joe Biden, Republican Donald Trump, independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr, independent Cornel West, or the Green Party\u2019s Jill Stein?\n\nFavorability\n\nAll the five candidates and Vice President Kamala Harris have net negative favorability ratings, as shown in Table 5, with more unfavorable than favorable ratings. The independent candidates, Kennedy and especially Stein and West, have high rates of \u201chaven\u2019t heard enough.\u201d Harris has the highest net negative rating at -24, with Biden at -21 and Trump at -17.\n\nTable 5: Favorability ratings\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nCandidate Favorability Net favorable Favorable Unfavorable Haven't heard enough Kamala Harris -24 35 59 6 Joe Biden -21 39 60 1 Donald Trump -17 41 58 1 Robert F.

His net favorability has fallen from -5 in November 2021 to -21 in the current survey.\n\nTable 6: Biden favorability trend\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nPoll dates Favorability Net favorable Favorable Unfavorable Haven't heard enough 5/6-15/24 -21 39 60 1 3/18-28/24 -20 40 60 1 2/5-15/24 -20 40 60 1 11/2-7/23 -19 40 59 1 9/18-25/23 -21 39 60 1 7/7-12/23 -17 41 58 1 5/8-18/23 -23 37 60 3 3/13-22/23 -15 41 56 3 1/9-20/23 -11 43 54 2 11/15-22/22 -6 46 52 3 9/7-14/22 -9 44 53 2 7/5-12/22 -26 35 61 3 5/9-19/22 -17 40 57 3 3/14-24/22 -10 44 54 2 1/10-21/22 -6 46 52 3 11/1-10/21 -5 45 50 5 Marquette Law School Poll, national surveys, latest: May 6-15, 2024 Question: Do you have a favorable or an unfavorable opinion of the following people or haven\u2019t you heard enough yet to have an opinion?\n\nThe favorability trend for Trump is shown in Table 7.

The number of those unfavorable to both has remained near 20% since November 2021. Trump is seen favorably and Biden unfavorably by 39% while 37% are favorable to Biden and unfavorable to Trump. Just 2% are favorable to both. The trend for favorability to both Biden and Trump is shown in Table 8.\n\nTable 8: Favorability to Biden and Trump, November 2021-May 2024\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nPoll dates Favorability to both Fav Biden, Fav Trump Fav Biden, Unfav Trump Unfav Biden, Fav Trump Unfav Biden, Unfav Trump DK either 5/6-15/24 2 37 39 21 1 3/18-28/24 3 37 40 19 1 2/5-15/24 2 37 42 17 1 11/2-7/23 3 36 38 20 2 9/18-25/23 3 36 39 20 2 7/7-12/23 1 39 33 23 3 5/8-18/23 2 35 36 23 5 3/13-22/23 2 39 32 23 5 1/9-20/23 1 42 34 19 4 11/15-22/22 1 44 30 21 4 9/7-14/22 1 43 32 21 3 7/5-12/22 0 35 34 26 5 5/9-19/22 1 39 36 20 4 3/14-24/22 2 41 35 18 3 1/10-21/22 2 44 29 22 4 11/1-10/21 1 43 30 20 6 Marquette Law School Poll, national surveys, latest: May 6-15, 2024 Question: Do you have a favorable or an unfavorable opinion of the following people or haven\u2019t you heard enough yet to have an opinion?\n\nThose who are unfavorable to both have varied in their vote choices over recent polls, as shown in Table 9. In the current poll, among those unfavorable to both, 57% support Biden and 43% support Trump. In November 2023, Trump had the advantage with those unfavorable to both, 52% to Biden\u2019s 48%, but Biden has held the advantage in each of the 2024 polls. (The sample size of those favorable to both Biden and Trump is too small for meaningful analysis and so is omitted from the table.)\n\nTable 9: Biden vs. Trump vote, by favorability to both\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nFavorability to Biden and Trump Vote Joe Biden Donald Trump 5/6-15/24 Fav Biden, Unfav Trump 97 3 Unfav Biden, Fav Trump 1 99 Unfav Biden, Unfav Trump 57 43 3/18-28/24 Fav Biden, Unfav Trump 100 0 Unfav Biden, Fav Trump 0 100 Unfav Biden, Unfav Trump 59 41 2/5-15/24 Fav Biden, Unfav Trump 98 2 Unfav Biden, Fav Trump 0 100 Unfav Biden, Unfav Trump 63 36 11/2-7/23 Fav Biden, Unfav Trump 98 2 Unfav Biden, Fav Trump 1 99 Unfav Biden, Unfav Trump 48 52 Marquette Law School Poll, national surveys, latest: May 6-15, 2024 Question: If the 2024 election for president were held today between Former President Donald Trump, the Republican, and President Joe Biden, the Democrat, would you vote for Donald Trump or for Joe Biden? Question: If you had to choose, would you vote for Biden or for Trump? Question: Do you have a favorable or an unfavorable opinion of the following people or haven\u2019t you heard enough yet to have an opinion?\n\nPresidential approval\n\nBiden\u2019s job approval in May was 40% with 60% disapproving, unchanged since March.\n\nAsked if they approved or disapproved of how Trump handled his job when he was president, 46% approved and 54% disapproved. This is essentially unchanged since March, when 47% approved and 53% disapproved.\n\nA strength of Biden has been his ability, despite his high disapproval rate, to win votes from those who \u201csomewhat disapprove\u201d of how he has handled his job as president: the poll shows him typically winning a small majority of this group of voters. In this survey, Biden wins 53% from those somewhat disapproving of his job performance, with Trump supported by 47% of that group. Biden\u2019s advantage with those who somewhat disapprove is smaller in May than in other Marquette Law School Poll surveys. Table 10 shows how voters choose to vote for Biden or Trump by strength of approval or disapproval of Biden\u2019s job performance. In addition to his just-noted small lead among the somewhat disapproving group, Biden wins large percentages of both categories of approving, while Trump dominates the strongly disapproving voters.\n\nTable 10: Biden vs Trump vote, by Biden job approval\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nBiden job approval Vote Joe Biden Donald Trump 5/6-15/24 Strongly approve 92 8 Somewhat approve 92 8 Somewhat disapprove 53 47 Strongly disapprove 9 91 3/18-28/24 Strongly approve 99 1 Somewhat approve 94 6 Somewhat disapprove 61 39 Strongly disapprove 8 92 2/5-15/24 Strongly approve 98 2 Somewhat approve 91 9 Somewhat disapprove 60 40 Strongly disapprove 4 95 11/2-7/23 Strongly approve 97 3 Somewhat approve 91 9 Somewhat disapprove 55 45 Strongly disapprove 6 94 Marquette Law School Poll, national surveys, latest: May 6-15, 2024 Question: If the 2024 election for president were held today between former President Donald Trump, the Republican, and President Joe Biden, the Democrat, would you vote for Donald Trump or for Joe Biden? Question: If you had to choose, would you vote for Biden or for Trump? Question: Overall, do you approve or disapprove of the way Joe Biden is handling his job as president?\n\nPerceptions of Biden and Trump\n\nTable 11 shows which candidate is thought to do a better job on eight issues. The list is presented in declining order for Trump based on the current survey:\n\nImmigration and border security: Trump 52%, Biden 25%\n\nThe economy: Trump 50%, Biden 29%\n\nHandling the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza: Trump 42%, Biden 28%\n\nForeign relations: Trump 43%, Biden 36%\n\nMedicare & Social Security: Biden 40%, Trump 35%\n\nHealthcare: Biden 41%, Trump 32%\n\nAbortion policy: Biden 43%, Trump 32%\n\nEnsuring fair and accurate elections: Biden 45%, Trump 31%\n\nThese views of the candidates have remained quite stable over the last three polls. (Ensuring fair elections appears in the May poll for the first time.)\n\nThe percentage who say neither candidate would be good, or they would both be about the same, ranges from 21% to 30%, an indication that even with two such well-known candidates, there remains considerable doubt over how successfully each would handle these issues.\n\nTable 11: Who would handle issues better\n\nRegistered voters\n\nWho is better on issue Poll dates Biden Trump Both about the same Neither good Immigration and border security 5/6-15/24 25 52 8 14 3/18-28/24 27 54 7 12 2/5-15/24 25 53 6 15 11/2-7/23 27 50 7 16 The economy 5/6-15/24 29 50 10 11 3/18-28/24 32 51 9 9 2/5-15/24 32 52 7 10 11/2-7/23 30 51 7 11 Handling the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza 5/6-15/24 28 42 9 21 3/18-28/24 32 42 9 17 2/5-15/24 28 43 11 18 11/2-7/23 31 42 11 16 Foreign relations 5/6-15/24 36 43 10 11 3/18-28/24 39 41 8 12 2/5-15/24 37 44 7 12 11/2-7/23 38 44 7 11 Medicare & Social Security 5/6-15/24 40 35 13 12 3/18-28/24 39 36 14 11 2/5-15/24 40 36 13 11 11/2-7/23 38 39 11 12 Health care 5/6-15/24 41 32 15 13 3/18-28/24 40 34 13 13 2/5-15/24 42 34 13 11 Abortion policy 5/6-15/24 43 32 11 14 3/18-28/24 42 33 10 15 2/5-15/24 42 34 11 12 11/2-7/23 41 34 10 14 Ensuring fair and accurate elections 5/6-15/24 45 31 10 14 Marquette Law School Poll, national surveys, latest: May 6-15, 2024 Question: Do you think Joe Biden or Donald Trump would do a better job handling each of the following issues? Health care not asked in November\n\nAsked which issues will be most important for their vote in November, respondents said the three most important issues were the economy (36%), immigration and border security (20%), and abortion policy (10%). The full set of responses is shown in Table 12.\n\nTable 12: Most important issue, May 2024\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nPercent Most Important Issue Percent The economy 36 Immigration and border security 20 Abortion policy 10 Medicare & Social Security 9 Ensuring fair and accurate elections 8 Health care 5 Foreign relations 3 The war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza 3 Don\u2019t know 8 Marquette Law School Poll, national survey, May 6-15, 2024 Question: Which one of the following issues will be MOST important in deciding your vote for president?\n\nPartisans differ sharply in which issues they think are most important, as shown in Table 13. Republicans give top priority to the economy and immigration, with all other issues rated much lower. Democrats also rate the economy as most important, followed by abortion policy, with Medicare & Social Security and ensuring fair elections also receiving double-digit ratings. Independents rate the economy first, with immigration a distant second.\n\nTable 13: Most important issue, by party identification\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nMost important issue Party Identification Republican Independent Democrat The economy 40 41 31 Immigration and border security 37 14 3 Health care 2 5 7 Foreign relations 2 7 4 Abortion policy 5 6 15 Medicare & Social Security 5 2 14 The war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza 2 7 3 Ensuring fair and accurate elections 3 4 13 Don\u2019t know 5 14 10 Marquette Law School Poll, national surveys, latest: May 6-15, 2024 Question: Which one of the following issues will be MOST important in deciding your vote for president?\n\nCandidate characteristics\n\nTable 14 shows how well various phrases describe Biden and Trump. Biden particularly is seen as too old to be president compared to those who see Trump as too old, with 79% saying this phrase describes Biden very or somewhat well and 54% saying the same of Trump. The other characteristics measured with the percentage who thought this described the candidate very well:\n\n\u201cShares your values\u201d: Biden 45%, Trump 44%\n\n\u201cHas behaved corruptly\u201d: Trump 64%, Biden 44%\n\n\u201cStrong record of accomplishment as president\u201d: Trump 51%, Biden 41%\n\n\u201cHas the right temperament to be president\u201d: Biden 52%, Trump 37%.\n\nTable 14: How well does this phrase describe Biden or Trump\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nIssue How well phrase describes Very/somewhat well Not too/not at all well Is too old to be president Biden 79 21 Trump 54 46 Shares your values Biden 45 55 Trump 44 56 Has behaved corruptly Biden 44 56 Trump 64 36 Strong record of accomplishments as president Biden 41 59 Trump 51 49 Has the right temperament to be president Biden 52 48 Trump 37 63 Marquette Law School Poll, national survey, May 6-15, 2024 Question: How well does each of the following phrases describe (Joe Biden)(Donald Trump)?\n\nUndocumented-immigrant policy\n\nSupport for deporting immigrants who are in the United States illegally has been quite high in recent polls. In the March national Marquette Law School Poll, a question was worded as\n\n\u201cDo you favor or oppose deporting immigrants who are living in the United States illegally back to their home countries?\u201d\n\nIn that March poll, 63% said they favored such deportations, while 37% were opposed.\n\nIn the May survey, we conducted a test of how framing of this issue might affect responses. A random half of respondents were asked the same question as in March, while the other half of respondents was asked:\n\n\u201cDo you favor or oppose deporting immigrants who are living in the United States illegally back to their home countries even if they have lived here for a number of years, have jobs and no criminal record?\u201d\n\nThis alternate framing produces substantially different responses. As in March, the prior wording finds 64% in favor of and 36% opposed to deportations. When the question includes such mention of long-term residents with jobs and no criminal record, the majority reverses, with 52% opposed to deportations and 48% in favor. These results are shown in Table 15.\n\nTable 15: Deportation-policy wording experiment\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nQuestion wording Favor or op/pose Favor Oppose Deport, with no qualifications 64 36 Deport even if long resident, job, no criminal record 48 52 Marquette Law School Poll, national surveys, latest: May 6-15, 2024 Question: Do you favor or oppose deporting immigrants who are living in the United States illegally back to their home countries? Question: Do you favor or oppose deporting immigrants who are living in the United States illegally back to their home countries even if they have lived here for a number of years, have jobs and no criminal record?\n\nAttention to topics in the news\n\nOf recent events in the news, respondents paid somewhat more attention to college campus protests against the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza than to Trump\u2019s trial, with 73% hearing a lot about the protests, 21% hearing a little, and 6% hearing nothing at all.\n\nArguments were heard at the U.S. Supreme Court in Trump v. United States, concerning presidential immunity from criminal prosecution for acts as president. Forty-nine percent said they heard a lot about this, 41% heard a little, and 10% heard nothing.\n\nAfter months of debate, the House of Representatives passed a foreign aid package that included aid to Ukraine and to Israel. Asked about these separately, 44% said they heard a lot about the passage of Ukraine aid, 42% heard a little, and 14% heard nothing. Asked about aid to Israel and humanitarian aid to Gaza, also part of the legislation, 39% heard a lot, 45% heard a little, and 15% heard nothing.\n\nRespondents are more likely to say they have paid a lot of attention to news about inflation than to news about unemployment. The survey asks about the latest reports of the Consumer Price Index and of the unemployment rate for the most recent month available at the time of the survey. Table 16 shows attention paid to this news for inflation and for unemployment.\n\nTable 16: How much heard about economic news\n\nRegistered voters\n\nHow much heard or read Issue A lot A little Nothing at all Inflation rate 41 45 14 Unemployment rate 22 47 30 Marquette Law School Poll, national survey, May 6-15, 2024 Question: Here are some recent topics in the news. How much have you heard or read about each of these? . . . News reports that consumer prices (inflation) rose by 3.5% over the past 12 months (as of March) Question: Here are some recent topics in the news. How much have you heard or read about each of these? . . . News reports that the unemployment rate was 3.9% (as of April)\n\nThe attention to news about campus protests against the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza is related to views of how the protests should be handled. Among all registered voters, 39% say the protesters should be arrested, while 40% say colleges should allow the protests to continue and 21% say they don\u2019t know.\n\nTable 17 shows the relationship between attention to news concerning the protests and view of how the protests should be handled. Those who have paid the most attention to the protests are considerably more likely to favor arresting protesters than those who have paid little or no attention to news about the protest.\n\nTable 17: How to handle protests, by news heard about protests\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nAmount heard How to handle protest Arrest protesters Allow protests to continue Don\u2019t know A lot 46 35 18 A little 20 52 28 Nothing at all 14 55 32 Marquette Law School Poll, national surveys, latest: May 6-15, 2024 Question: Here are some recent topics in the news. How much have you heard or read about each of these? . . . College campus protests against the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza Question: Should colleges have police arrest student protesters opposing the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza or should colleges allow the protests to continue as a matter of free speech?\n\nEconomic perceptions\n\nViews of the nation\u2019s economy have declined slightly since February. Table 18 shows the trend over the past five polls, with a dip in positive views and rise in negative views in the March and May surveys compared to February.\n\nTable 18: View of the national economy\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nPoll dates View of the economy Excellent Good Not so good Poor 5/6-15/24 3 28 38 31 3/18-28/24 5 28 38 29 2/5-15/24 6 29 40 25 11/2-7/23 3 24 40 33 9/18-25/23 3 20 45 32 Marquette Law School Poll, national surveys, latest: May 6-15, 2024 Question: How would you describe the state of the nation\u2019s economy these days?\n\nAsked about the economy in their state, respondents are a little more positive, though a majority say it is not so good or poor. The comparison is shown in Table 19.\n\nTable 19: View of the national and state economy\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nView of the economy Question wording Excellent Good Not so good Poor National economy 3 28 38 31 State economy 5 34 38 24 Marquette Law School Poll, national surveys, latest: May 6-15, 2024 Question: How would you describe the state of the nation\u2019s economy these days? Question: How would you describe the economy in your state these days?\n\nAsked about their personal financial situation, 40% said they are living comfortably, 42% are just getting by, and 18% say they are struggling. This is a dip in the percent living comfortable from the March survey. The full trend since September 2023 is shown in Table 20.\n\nTable 20: Personal finances trend\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nPoll dates Financial situation Living comfortably Just getting by Struggling 5/6-15/24 40 42 18 3/18-28/24 46 38 16 2/5-15/24 42 41 17 11/2-7/23 39 43 19 9/18-25/23 37 45 17 Marquette Law School Poll, national surveys, latest: May 6-15, 2024 Question: Thinking about your family's financial situation, would you say you are living comfortably, just getting by, or struggling to make ends meet?\n\nInternational issues\n\nForty-seven percent say Biden has been working to negotiate a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, while 25% say he has not and 28% say they don\u2019t know. This is unchanged from March.\n\nThose saying the U.S. is giving too much support to Israel rose slightly, to 42% from 37% in March, while those saying not enough aid is being given barely changed at 25%, up from 24%. The full trend on views of aid to Israel is shown in Table 21.\n\nTable 21: Aid to Israel trend\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nPoll dates Amount of aid is Too much support Not enough support About the right amount of support 5/6-15/24 42 25 33 3/18-28/24 37 24 39 2/5-15/24 41 21 38 Marquette Law School Poll, national surveys, latest: May 6-15, 2024 Question: When it comes to Israel\u2019s war with Hamas in Gaza, do you think the United States is providing too much support to Israel, not enough support to Israel, or about the right amount of support to Israel?\n\nThe trend in views of aid to Ukraine is shown in Table 22. There has been a general rise in the percent saying the U.S. is giving too much aid and a decline in the percent saying about the right amount of aid.\n\nTable 22: Aid to Ukraine\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nPoll dates Amount of aid is Too much support Not enough support About the right amount of support 5/6-15/24 41 26 33 3/18-28/24 36 32 32 2/5-15/24 37 27 37 11/2-7/23 38 22 40 9/18-25/23 38 21 41 7/7-12/23 35 20 45 5/8-18/23 35 22 43 3/13-22/23 34 24 42 1/9-20/23 29 22 49 11/15-22/22 31 24 45 Marquette Law School Poll, national surveys, latest: May 6-15, 2024 Question: When it comes to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, do you think the United States is providing too much support to Ukraine, not enough support to Ukraine, or about the right amount of support to Ukraine?\n\nAbortion\n\nPreferences over abortion policy have changed little in polling since May 2022, with 70% saying abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while 30% say it should be illegal in all or most cases. Table 23 shows the full trend on these preferences.\n\nTable 23: Abortion policy preference trend\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nPoll dates Policy preference Legal in all cases Legal in most cases Illegal in most cases Illegal in all cases 5/6-15/24 34 36 24 6 3/18-28/24 31 39 24 6 2/5-15/24 30 40 24 6 11/2-7/23 28 38 25 9 9/18-25/23 33 36 25 6 7/7-12/23 29 36 29 6 5/8-18/23 32 36 26 6 3/13-22/23 28 36 29 6 1/9-20/23 26 38 29 7 11/15-22/22 31 37 24 8 9/7-14/22 32 35 27 6 7/5-12/22 29 35 28 8 5/9-19/22 29 37 25 8 Marquette Law School Poll, national surveys, latest: May 6-15, 2024 Question: Do you think abortion should be legal in all cases, legal in most cases, illegal in most cases, or illegal in all cases?\n\nAbout the Marquette Law School Poll\n\nThe survey was conducted May 6-15, 2024, interviewing 902 registered voters nationwide, with a margin of error of +/-4.6 percentage points.

        "text": "The Doorstep | U.S. Election 2024 in a Post-Policy World, with Tom Nichols\nTATIANA SERAFIN: Welcome to this edition of The Doorstep. I am Tatiana Serafin, senior fellow here at Carnegie Council.\n\nNIKOLAS GVOSDEV: And I am Nick Gvosdev, senior fellow at Carnegie Council as well, really pleased to welcome Tom Nichols, my former colleague at the U.S. Naval War College and the Harvard Extension School, now a staff writer with The Atlantic and also the author of Our Own Worst Enemy: The Assault from within on Modern Democracy. We had him on our podcast here four years ago to discuss that book, and now in 2024, just rereleased, is the second edition of The Death of Expertise: The Campaign against Established Knowledge and Why it Matters, here to talk about everything from vibes, the election, what motivates people to vote, and what we can expect in this coming election season. With that, Tatiana, I think we will go right into this very fascinating conversation with Tom.\n\nTom, it is so great to have you back with us at The Doorstep. I want to plunge right in with something that you have been discussing on your X and Bluesky and Threads accounts today which touches very much on this notion of news, information, and the informed citizenry. You have been dealing with the reality that Americans believe that we are in a recession when we are not and that people are claiming that the S&P 500 is down, when it is actually up.\n\nGiven that you have been able to release the second edition of Death of Expertise, are there any lessons that we are learning from the second edition of the book and these real-time examples about how people are gaining information but more importantly does it even matter? Do facts even matter any more, or are we now just in a post-fact, what I feel?\n\nTOM NICHOLS: No. Facts are secondary to vibes and feelings.\n\nOne of the things I think is common to both editions of the book, a problem that has actually gotten worse over time, is that we increasingly prioritize emotion and feelings over reason and facts, and this is part of the underlying problem. I wrote about this in Our Own Worst Enemy as well as in The Death of Expertise. It is this underlying narcissism that says: \u201cLook, if I feel like the S&P 500 is down, who are you to tell me that it\u2019s not? What, are you calling me stupid? Are you telling me that my feelings don\u2019t matter?\u201d\n\nUnfortunately the right answer to that, on this, is: \u201cThat\u2019s right; your feelings don\u2019t matter.\u201d People get angry. I had a conversation back during the 2016 election. Donald Trump had said real unemployment was something like 40 percent, and one of my friends, a close friend, said to me, \u201cWell, it could be that unemployment is 40 percent.\u201d\n\nI said, \u201cEven during the Great Depression it wasn\u2019t 40 percent; it was like 25 percent.\u201d I said, \u201cIf it were 40 percent, we would be fighting over canned goods in the streets.\u201d\n\nHe paused, and he said, \u201cBut what if I feel like it is?\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know how you answer somebody who is\u2014of course, this being a close friend, I said: \u201cWho cares about your feelings? You\u2019re just wrong.\u201d But it is hard to tussle with that, to tussle with someone who says, \u201cYes, but what if I feel like we\u2019re in a recession?\u201d\n\nI think there are a couple of reasons for it, very quickly. One is, people pay attention to negative news. The media pushes negative news, but even when the media pushes good news people do not pay attention to it. They just wave it off as not relevant or ephemeral or transitory.\n\nThe other\u2014and this is an interesting psychological problem, almost a superstition\u2014is that people do not like to jinx good news by admitting it. My late dad had a lot of friends in the restaurant business, and he would always laugh because these guys would be making money hand over fist, but if you ask them how they are doing, they would say, \u201cYou know, it could be better, it has been tough.\u201d They almost felt like they were endangering it to say, \u201cYes, I\u2019m having a good year,\u201d because the minute they said that it would stop happening.\n\nThere is one other thing that I think is peculiar especially to people who tend toward the left side of the political spectrum, which is that they tend to dismiss good news about themselves or their situation because they think that it is unkind or not compassionate to other people who might be suffering. If you say, \u201cLook, we have had the longest stretch of under 4 percent unemployment since the 1950s,\u201d a lot of folks from that side of the political argument will say: \u201cYes, but someone is suffering somewhere. There are still people who are living paycheck to paycheck,\u201d which is always true. Even in the best economy there is frictional unemployment and people are struggling, but I think that for a particular group of people they think it is almost gauche to acknowledge good news.\n\nFor all these reasons, we simply view everything, whether it is foreign policy, economic data, or whatever, through this emotional priority rather than the cool lens of reason and rationality.\n\nTATIANA SERAFIN: I think that certainly social media does not help because it fosters polarization. What I want to know \u2014 and you talk in one of your latest pieces \u2014 it is called the \u201cMAGA memory hole,\u201d and I want you to talk a little bit about that because you are back with us after a long while, almost four years. You were with us on our fourth episode, which was called, \u201cThe World Waits for the Next U.S. President,\u201d and, gosh, we are in the same place. Is it a memory hole or are we stuck in time?\n\nTOM NICHOLS: Some of it is a memory hole. For those of you who are not up on your high school-era literature, of course the term is from the book 1984, where inconvenient facts were shoved into a little slit in an office that took them to a furnace, never to be seen again.\n\nI was talking about people on the left; now this is people on the right. They view the past very emotively. Nick and I, of course, are big The Simpsons fans. What\u2019s the line from The Simpsons? \u201cEverything is bad if you remember it.\u201d I think a lot of folks simply wave away things that happen and say, \u201cWell, that was a long time ago,\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t really remember that,\u201d and especially, Tatiana, as you are pointing out about social media, it leads us into a kind of presentism, that nothing happened yesterday, tomorrow is unknowable, and everything is happening in the immediate ten minutes of this moment that I am typing on social media.\n\nYou cannot sustain a democracy on that. To use another pop culture allusion, that means that everybody is like the guy in the movie Memento, who could not form new memories. Every morning he wakes up and has to look at pictures and check himself for tattoos and little notes he has left himself because every time he goes to sleep he forgets everything and has to start all over again the next day.\n\nInformed consent and participation in the political process means that you accumulate, interpret, and analyze information over time and that you have some memory of yesterday and some ability to forecast into tomorrow, and that is not emotionally satisfying. Now that we live in a post-material political era, that is, where we are not constantly trying to figure out how we are going to eat food, keep ourselves warm in the winter, or survive to the end of the day against invading hordes, packs of wolves, or whatever\u2014and by the way, that era came to an end a lot more recently than people realize\u2014that now we are free to say, \u201cYou know, my material needs are all met and now I can just feel stuff about politics.\u201d\n\nIt is especially hard for somebody like Joe Biden, who is trying to run on a record as an incumbent. It is easier for the challenger, Donald Trump, to simply say, \u201cEverything you feel is true because I\u2019m not in office and I\u2019m not responsible for it.\u201d You cannot run elections this way. No democracy can stay on this treadmill of vibes for very long.\n\nNIKOLAS GVOSDEV: Can I connect to your last point there? You are talking about Joe Biden running on a record. Four years ago it was Donald Trump trying to run on a record or at least to get people to accept what his definition of the record was, and it was Joe Biden as the challenger. Now we have flipped the script in a way.\n\nThere is this underlying sense also \u2014 and I liked your point about post-material politics \u2014 that no matter what happens, it just can\u2019t get that bad. If I feel this, and if we make a choice, what is the worse that could happen? What does that mean for, again, our audience, the informed public, and citizens getting ready to vote, this sense of, \u201cWell, it really doesn\u2019t matter because how bad could it get?\u201d Is there a difference this time around?\n\nAgain, we had you in 2020, days before the November election. We did not necessarily fully understand what might result from that election and then manifest itself the following January, but this time around what may be at stake? As you said, we cannot sustain a democracy on vibes for the long term. We cannot sustain a republic. What does this also mean, this sense that no choice is fatal, it doesn\u2019t really matter, or how bad can it get?\n\nTOM NICHOLS: The phrase we are looking for here is \u201cnormalcy bias.\u201d No matter what happens, tomorrow is going to look mostly like today. That is true right up until the day it isn\u2019t, and people have a hard time getting their arms around that. I will put in a plug for my magazine here, for The Atlantic. We did an entire special issue with two dozen authors saying, \u201cThis is what a second term of Donald Trump could look like,\u201d because we wanted to help people imagine this. As my editor-in-chief Jeff Goldberg said, \u201cAnd to put it in front of the American people and ask, \u2018Is this what you want?\u2019\u201d\n\nYou have to make an informed decision. It cannot just be, whether you are a Trump voter or Biden voter, I don\u2019t think anybody thinks\u2014I shouldn\u2019t say that. I think too many people think that a second Trump term is going to be like another term of Biden but with lower gas prices, but even Biden and Trump supporters, the most ardent ones, would say: \u201cThat\u2019s not true. There would be dramatic changes.\u201d\n\nThere is a great line from Ernest Hemingway about going bankrupt that I think applies to this kind of political change: \u201cHow do you go bankrupt? Gradually, and then all at once.\u201d I think people are not internalizing how much things can change.\n\nI think that is one of the reasons we had trouble dealing with the pandemic. I remember driving around those first weeks in 2020 and saying, \u201cThis is like a dystopian science fiction novel,\u201d literally a once-in-a-hundred-year thing, and it took me a while to internalize. I remember my daughter asking me, \u201cHow long is this going to last?\u201d I was like, \u201cGee, I don\u2019t know. It could be three, four, five months maybe.\u201d The idea that I would have said, \u201cLook, our life is fundamentally different and will be for at least two years and it is going to change\u201d\u2014that was a hard thing to conceptualize. I think people are having a hard time conceptualizing any kind of serious political change.\n\nWhatever my personal feelings about Donald Trump, that is not a partisan comment. These are things Trump himself is saying he will do that are dramatic departures from the norms of American politics, and I think a lot of folks and just saying, \u201cWell, you know, it is just stuff people say.\u201d\n\nWhen we were talking back in 2017 it was all notional. We said, \u201cWell, maybe it\u2019s an act, maybe he doesn\u2019t really mean some of that stuff, maybe he wouldn\u2019t govern that way,\u201d but after four years I think these are things that he said that we have to take seriously.\n\nI think voters are not focused on that because again they have replaced a lot of what happens in the political world with the movie they are watching in their heads rather than what is actually happening out there because they have already made up their minds and are reverse engineering everything to get to their preferred political choice anyway.\n\nTATIANA SERAFIN: Tom, I want to ask you from a doorstep angle \u2014 we have been trying to present international news related to the American audience in a way that is meaningful. Where do you think that stands? Do you think the American public is looking at international news or, to your point in our conversation, looking at whatever is in the moment and their feeling about it? I am wondering this in particular because what happened to Ukraine and why aren\u2019t we talking about Iran more? How is this going to impact one of our questions from four years ago: What is the world expecting from us?\n\nTOM NICHOLS: Unfortunately foreign policy is always secondary to most voter concerns. I don\u2019t think foreign policy has taken a front seat in a presidential election I guess, you could say, since 2004 because we were actually in a shooting war, but even then there was a whole bundle of issues around that, and maybe 1984 with the Cold War and nuclear weapons playing a big part\u2014the infamous \u201cbear in the woods\u201d ad that the Republicans ran about the Soviet Union and so on. Otherwise, the public does not pay a whole lot of attention to foreign policy.\n\nIt is like a kitten with a laser pointer. This gigantic war\u2014and I keep trying to emphasize to people, the largest war since the Nazis went on the march in Europe\u2014is taking place in the middle of Europe, and that has been pushed aside by Gaza, which has, for various reasons, engaged the public\u2019s attention, particularly because of campus unrest.\n\nThen the story became not Gaza and the war against Hamas but the protests about it on campuses, which actually reflect a small number of very vocal students. Once again, people are not focusing on huge foreign policy differences in this election. Donald Trump says things like he is going to pull us out of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and people shrug, like, \u201cI don\u2019t really know what means, and NATO has always been there\u201d\u2014again, there is that normalcy bias: \u201cThings can\u2019t really change that much. He couldn\u2019t really do that.\u201d But there are a bunch of things that could happen that would change our place in the world and turn us maybe not into a second-rate power but into a much quicker declining power if we do not pay attention to them.\n\nAgain, I think most people have made up their minds about how they feel about the candidates and about issues in the world, and then they\u2014I will use this expression again\u2014\u201creverse engineer\u201d how to get there. They say: \u201cMy guy does not like NATO; well then, neither do I. I have never really thought about NATO, but now I don\u2019t like it.\u201d\n\nInterestingly enough, the Democrats have gone in the other direction. When I was a younger person working in politics, the Democrats were the go-slow folks on defense spending, confronting the Russians, and taking on the Kremlin, and now the Democratic Party has become the pro-NATO, anti-Kremlin party, but I just don\u2019t think people are paying enough attention to that.\n\nNIKOLAS GVOSDEV: I wanted to pick up that reverse-engineering point because I think that it also speaks to something in our politics. Over the last number of months we have had a lot of attention paid and a lot of virtual ink spilled about members of Congress, the vote on the supplemental, support for Israel, and support for Ukraine. What we are seeing now is that voters may say in polling data, \u201cI support aid to Ukraine\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t support aid to Ukraine,\u201d but how their member voted on that supplemental doesn\u2019t seem to matter. At the end of the day\u2014and we are seeing it from a number of these primary challenges\u2014\u201cWell, you were against this, so we are going to run a primary challenge.\u201d \u201cWell, I disagreed with Congressman So-and-So on this issue, but at the end of the day I support aid to Ukraine, she voted against it, but that is not going to change my vote.\u201d\n\nIs there a sense that\u2014again, going back to the vibes question\u2014that people are not voting on platforms, they are not voting on what people say they are going to do or not do in office, and that it is more, \u201cDo I feel that you represent me\u201d or \u201cDo you not like the people I don\u2019t like\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re going to hurt the people I don\u2019t like politically\u201d or otherwise? What are you seeing after two editions of Death of Expertise and speaking engagements all across the country over the last eight years? Where is this going?\n\nTOM NICHOLS: There is no persistence of views about policy. One reason I think that the Republicans who voted in favor of the Ukraine bill did not pay a price for it is that once it was over nobody cared.\n\nThis goes back to Tatiana\u2019s point about social media. A lot of people\u2014I have argued this, as you say, Nick, when I have done speaking gigs. I say: \u201cLook, you are not required to have an instantaneous opinion about everything all the time.\u201d But people do that and it becomes the very online version of that discourse that most voters are not a part of. Most voters probably could not tell you how their rep voted on the Ukraine aid package. The ones who are very vocal about it and propel it into the narrative, discourse, or whatever we call all this, when we wave our hands and say \u201call this,\u201d they feel very strongly about it until they go on to feel strongly about something else. So you get this kaleidoscope of changing issues that I think puts a lot of distance between elected officials and the public, because elected officials cannot keep up with that. They do not have that luxury.\n\nI worked for a mayor, a state representative, and a U.S. senator. When people call with very contradictory or almost impossible things\u2014\u201cGood morning. What\u2019s your issue?\u201d\n\n\u201cI would like the senator to close down the Federal Reserve.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you for your interest in government. That is not going to happen.\u201d\n\nOr the people even now who call their congressman and say, \u201cI want you to repeal Obamacare, but I want you to keep the Affordable Care Act.\u201d Your elected officials at that point go: \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll do that,\u201d then hang up the phone and say, \u201cWe\u2019re just going to do whatever we gotta do\u201d based on other priorities or criterion including donors, money, vocal constituency groups, and so on.\u201d\n\nI think part of the problem is that we live in a post-policy world. The real way, Nick, to think about the \u201cvibes economy\u201d or the \u201cvibes election\u201d is that it is all a post-policy environment. I don\u2019t think most people outside of the wonk world that you, Tatiana, and I live in cannot explain the policy differences that they are voting on in any way that is going to hold water. They say, \u201cI want lower prices, I want cheaper gas, I want more affordable groceries, I want mortgage rates to come down,\u201d but those are wants; those are not policy preferences that can translate into anything. Presidents especially do not have a lot of control over any of that. Those presidents don\u2019t have control over it, but people say, \u201cWell, if he did, this is the guy I would want.\u201d\n\nYou and I have written about this. Political scientists call this the \u201cGreen Lantern theory,\u201d the superhero with a ring that can do anything if he just concentrates hard enough. I did not coin that great phrase. I have written about it as, \u201cThe president is not Superman.\u201d He cannot just fly fast and turn the Earth backward if you want him to, but people do not believe that anymore. We have come to believe in a very personalized and powerful presidency that bears almost no relationship to reality.\n\nTATIANA SERAFIN: I want to go back to your point about not knowing what policy your representative is for. Some people do not even know who their representative is. I think it is even more dire.\n\nAs you were talking, I was thinking, the latest issue I just got of The Atlantic\u2014Anne Applebaum, \u201cThe New Propaganda War\u201d\u2014and I know you wrote a piece about it too, \u201cAutocracies are Winning the Information War.\u201d I wonder if in part that is because of what we have been talking about here today, the fact that people are responding to an image or a feeling about an image rather than policy and information, so it is easier to promote propaganda if you are just going to relate it to a picture.\n\nTOM NICHOLS: The authoritarians who are attacking our information environment understand one thing about us that is important. They understand what a bored society we are and how much we crave drama and entertainment, and they provide it.\n\nThere is an interesting feedback loop that happened between American television and Russian television. People who watch Russian nighttime TV have referred to the \u201cFox-ification\u201d of Russian television, that nighttime Russian TV now looks a lot like Fox News with the chyrons, the dramatic sets, and the colorful backgrounds, the shouting, and all that stuff. But that feedback loop works in the other direction now. The Russians have been able I think to create stories that get play on the internet in some corners of American media.\n\nI saw just yesterday that even though Tucker Carlson was finally forced off Fox his Twitter show, his podcast, videocast, that is now on Twitter, the Russians are going to start streaming it in translation, again this kind of crosspollination, because Carlson toward the end on Fox was a very reliable conduit of Russian talking points. I am not saying he was working for the Russians, but there was a feedback loop there, where you could tune in at primetime to the biggest show on Fox with millions and millions of voters\u2014by the way, Fox\u2019s demographic being a much more likely to vote demographic in the over-55 demo\u2014and hear things that you would have heard on Russian television. Then on Russian television you would get the evening host saying: \u201cTucker Carlson is the smartest American commentator. Here is what he said today.\u201d\n\nThe authoritarian governments in China, Iran, and others have played that well because they understand that we don\u2019t want\u2014this is an analogy I use all the time\u2014nutritious, balanced meals of good information. We want junk food. We want sugary milkshakes and triple cheeseburgers, and they know how to promote that stuff.\n\nI will just end this rant, pointing out that Aaron Rodgers, the football player, actually went out there about a month ago, in April, and repeated the old Soviet\u2014not Russian\u2014propaganda story about COVID-19, AIDS, and all these diseases being developed by the U.S. Army. The Soviets did that with AIDS in the 1980s and later came out and said: \u201cYes, that was us. We can\u2019t believe we sucked you in on that one.\u201d I think the head of the SVR, the Foreign Intelligence Service, said this in the early 1990s, and yet here we are 40 years later and Aaron Rodgers is out there basically sending out that same line.\n\nWhy? Because it\u2019s interesting, because it\u2019s dramatic, because it\u2019s conspiratorial and thrilling, and the idea that sometimes stuff happens in the world, Americans have lost their appetite for that unfortunately. They want everything to be entertaining and dramatic so that they can cast themselves in the role of great warriors for great causes.\n\nNIKOLAS GVOSDEV: I want to take that last point and tie it to another point you just raised about voting and demographics. On the one hand, we have a reliable cohort of over-55 voters who come out. When you were with us last a big question was the youth vote, the under-29 vote: Was it going to turn out? How much would it turn out? What would motivate it to turn out?\n\nHere we are four years later, and again the question of youth turnout and youth enthusiasm is still on the agenda, the question of will the under-29s vote, and who are they going to vote for, or if they are, who are they not going to vote for?\n\nHow is this playing out? This theme you said of wanting to be part of the bigger story, this has been something I think we have tracked in American politics that people always want a Selma moment, they want to feel that they are at the center of historical, moving events. In 2020 we had elements of a big pandemic. This was supposed to be the election to reset to normalcy. Now in 2024 the race looks to be a tossup, and you have young people saying we are not going to vote or we\u2019re not sure who we\u2019re going to vote for. How is all of this going to play out?\n\nTOM NICHOLS: One thing that is true is that younger voters just don\u2019t vote at the same rate as older folks. That has been true even since I was a younger voter. I was unusual as a young voter; I never missed an election.\n\nTurnout rates among young voters are always bad, from the time they got the vote in the mid-1970s. There is a kind of \u201cLucy and the football\u201d feeling when you are dealing with younger voters. They say, \u201cWell, this time we\u2019re definitely going to show up, this time the youth vote is going to matter.\u201d It did in 2020 and we applauded the youth vote this time for only being 15 points behind everybody else. It was a higher-turnout election, but the youth vote lagged exactly the way it always does behind people much older.\n\nIf younger folks are watching this or listening to this, I will just say, \u201cIf you get mad about older people constantly getting their way with policy preferences about things like not forgiving student loans, the housing market, and other things, it\u2019s because they vote. It is because the system responds to the people who vote.\u201d We saw that bump in 2020 and then a dip in 2022.\n\nWith that said, I think in some races younger people really are coming around to the realization that this is their future at stake. I think overturning Roe v. Wade was a real shock. That is one of those normalcy things. I fell into that. For years I said: \u201cLook, calm down. No one\u2019s going to overturn Roe v. Wade.\u201d\n\nThere is possibly an apocryphal story about one of Reagan\u2019s staffers saying, \u201cNow that you are president, are you are going to try to get rid of abortion?\u201d and he said, \u201cDo I look crazy?\u201d Reagan was anti-abortion, but he understood that there were limits on that debate.\n\nNow it has actually happened and you have states that are basically trying to criminalize not just abortion but all kinds of reproductive care. Younger people are cluing into that, and I hope that they do.\n\nI think some of this too is social media or echo chamber stuff, when you have young people saying, \u201cI\u2019m not going to vote for Joe Biden because of Gaza,\u201d well, okay. Joe Biden is not the president of Israel, but if that is the thing that motivates you, that is your preference. But then if you poll all young people Gaza falls to something like 15th in terms of the policy interests of under-30 voters. That is a very niche kind of campus-oriented view about younger voters dumping Biden over Gaza or their student loans or whatever.\n\nMy bigger concern is that younger folks don\u2019t show up because it is in the nature of young voters not to show up. I think that is the bigger problem, and I don\u2019t think it has anything to do specifically with Joe Biden.\n\nBiden has trouble with younger voters because he is old. He looks old and he sounds old, and younger voters always want to have people\u2014the last president who really engaged those voters was Barack Obama in 2008, but once again, once Obama was elected with a quick surge in the youth vote that vote fell off again, and by 2010 the Republicans were able to make huge gains, and by 2014 they had recaptured\u2014in part relying on the youth vote not showing up\u2014a lot of seats, and by 2016, as I try to remind people all the time, the Republican Party in the United States controlled the House, the Senate, the White House, most governor\u2019s mansions, a lion\u2019s share of state legislatures, and most of the elected seats in various levels of government across the United States. The only thing that saved the Democrats from being a permanent minority was Donald Trump basically scaring the heck out of a lot of people and changing the dynamic of those elections.\n\nI keep trying to tell younger voters: \u201cYou could have everything you want. If you up your turnout by 7 or 8 percent, you could run the country,\u201d but it is tough to do.\n\nTATIANA SERAFIN: In all of this dismal news, is there any hope? What are you hopeful about as we look forward to the election and to the next year? What is your five-year outlook?\n\nTOM NICHOLS: I\u2019m not doing that five-year thing. That\u2019s like asking me in 1985 where I thought the Soviet Union would be in 1990. I am onto your clever interviewer tricks.\n\nWhat I am hoping for in the next five months is that people start taking what is at stake in this election seriously. I feel like we are an unserious electorate.\n\nNick opened this conversation saying half the people in this country think we are in a recession. That means two things: One is that no one understands what a recession is; and second, that people who self-report that their own well-being is quite high\u2014we know this now from multiple polls. People say, \u201cI\u2019m doing fine.\u201d When asked about life satisfaction, more than three-quarters of the people in this country say, \u201cI am satisfied or very satisfied with my quality of life\u201d and then somehow turn around and say \u201cBut everything is bad and we are in a recession and the S&P is down and it is a horrible time.\u201d\n\nThat is not a serious conversation. You cannot create policy out of that. All you can do is fall into a kind of TV show competition about who you like better. In some years that\u2019s fine; that\u2019s just the way elections are. People liked John F. Kennedy more than they liked Richard Nixon. There is the old problem of the people who saw the debate on TV thought Kennedy won; the people who heard it on the radio thought Nixon won.\n\nThis time around, the stakes are just too high. I believe we are in an existential political crisis in the United States. I think if Biden wins the election we are going to continue being this churlish electorate that is probably going to hobble a lot of policymaking, although one of the things I like about Joe Biden in general is that he ignores social media and does not take his cues from the online segment of the population.\n\nI think if Biden wins there will be violence. I think Trump is priming a lot of his voters for that, and I think if Trump wins there are going to be dramatic changes to our democracy that will include attacks on the rule of law, civil-military relations, and constitutional norms. I just wish people were thinking about that more.\n\nIn a way I would be more comfortable if people said, \u201cYes, I understand that Donald Trump is going to politicize the military, seize the Justice Department, use the Federal Bureau of Investigation against his enemies, and I want that.\u201d At least that would be a real argument to have with someone, but I think it is very difficult when someone says, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t think he ever said that.\u201d\n\nI get that a lot when I have conversations even offline, in the real world, with friends. I ask, \u201cHow do you feel about this?\u201d And they say: \u201cI don\u2019t remember that. I didn\u2019t hear that. I don\u2019t watch the news.\u201d\n\nI have a friend whose mother was a very staunch Trump voter, and during the January 6th hearings she asked her mom, \u201cHow do you feel about this now?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t watch any of that. I won\u2019t watch that.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know how you have conversations with people who feel that way. I don\u2019t know how you have conversations with young voters who say, \u201cJoe Biden is willfully enabling a genocide,\u201d which just isn\u2019t true. That is a wall of emotion in front of people that you cannot break through without infuriating them.\n\nBeing bipartisan about this, I think it is just as difficult sometimes to talk to folks who say, \u201cNothing bad that has happened in the economy or Afghanistan\u201d\u2014this is a particular one. \u201cThe withdrawal from Afghanistan went fine. Nobody could have handled it better than Joe Biden.\u201d\n\nI wrote about it at the time. I said: \u201cThis was not a well-executed plan. It was bungled terribly. People died. Presidents have to take responsibility for that,\u201d and I have had people say: \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. It was magnificent.\u201d That is the state of play in American politics now.\n\nNIKOLAS GVOSDEV: That is fascinating given that, Tatiana, we had a Doorstep that was essentially live from Kabul with our reporters there as this was going on telling us what was happening.\n\nWell, Tatiana, you always say I am the pessimistic one. You asked Tom for a note of good news.\n\nTOM NICHOLS: I didn\u2019t give you any, did I?\n\nNIKOLAS GVOSDEV: That makes me look like I am all sunshine and light.\n\nTOM NICHOLS: Let me try again and say that I think, no matter what happens in 2024, one of the real strengths of the American system of government is federalism and that the people who have argued that the day after Trump is elected darkness falls across the country, there will be some dangerous things that will happen, but they will not happen everywhere. There are still state governments, governors, legislatures, and a functioning Constitution. The idea that dictatorship happens in January 2025\u2014it is more difficult to do than that.\n\nI do have a lot of faith in the American public. I still think that they have not really clued into what is going on yet because it is May. We have not even had the summer conventions and debates that are coming and so on, but also I think one of the things we learned between 2016 and 2020 is that the president can issue all kinds of commands and orders but that there are plenty of states. We are a union of states. We are not a central government, we are a federal government, and there are plenty of states that said, \u201cWe\u2019re not doing that, and we\u2019re going to challenge you in court.\u201d\n\nThe Muslim ban was a good example. Day one: \u201cI\u2019m going to ban\u201d\u2014he never called it a \u201cMuslim\u201d ban\u2014\u201cpeople from these Muslim countries,\u201d and that got kicked back over and over and over again because there were lawyers, courts, and state governments that said: \u201cNo, you are not an emperor. We don\u2019t just simply do these things.\u201d There is my one attempt to put a little brightness into this otherwise gloomy thing.\n\nI cannot help but end on a note of gloom. If people do not comprehend reality and engage with what actually happens in the world, keep living inside their own heads, and keep watching the movie that is playing behind their eyes rather than what is happening out in the world, we are not long to exist as a functioning democracy and a superpower.\n\nTATIANA SERAFIN: I am going to leave it in the end on hope in our federal system. Thank you so much for joining us, Tom. This was a great conversation.\n\nTOM NICHOLS: Thank you.\n\nTATIANA SERAFIN: Thank you again for joining us for the penultimate edition of The Doorstep podcast.

        "text": "NBC News: Republicans and Democrats in Congress See Critical Window to Shield Online Data\nToday, the Innovation, Data, and Commerce Subcommittee is holding a markup of the American Privacy Rights Act to establish one national standard for data privacy and security for people of all ages\u2014including kids\u2014in all 50 states. The bipartisan, bicameral draft legislation gives Americans control over where their information goes and who can sell it, empowers individuals to enforce their data privacy rights, and reins in Big Tech. Don\u2019t miss key excerpts from NBC\u2019s article highlighting the bill below:\n\n\u201cThe presidential election is a little more than five months away, but key Republicans and Democrats in Congress see a critical window to pass sweeping legislation to shield the online data of both children and adults from Big Tech companies.\n\n\u201c\u2018I believe that there\u2019s a moment here where, on behalf of the American people, Congress needs to act,\u2019 House Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., said in an interview on the steps of the Capitol.\n\n\u201c\u2018There\u2019s a recognition, on behalf of protecting our kids online, in protecting all Americans, that we need to ensure that there are privacy rights in place \u2026 and that our identity is being protected online and that we\u2019re in control of our data,\u2019 she said.\n\n\u201cThe Energy and Commerce subcommittee that oversees online data will take the first step in trying to advance the privacy legislation, holding a markup Thursday on the American Privacy Rights Act, broad legislation that includes privacy protections for kids and adults, as well as the Kids Online Safety Act.\u201d\n\n[...]\n\n\u201cA revised draft bill was announced this week to address critics\u2019 concerns.\n\n\u201cThe American Privacy Rights Act would create national consumer data privacy rights and set federal standards for securing people\u2019s data rather than have a patchwork of state laws. Among other things, the legislation would require companies to be clear about how they use people\u2019s data and \u2018give consumers the right to access, correct, delete, and export their data,\u2019 according to a bill summary. The bill would also limit how companies collect and use data and ban transferring certain data to third parties without consent.\n\n\u201cThe measure includes the bipartisan bill to protect kids' and teens' online data, known as COPPA 2.0.\n\n\u201c\u2018I see the American Privacy Rights Act as foundational to protecting kids online, foundational to protecting our individual identity online,\u2019 McMorris Rodgers said.\n\n\u201cThe bipartisan privacy bill is gathering momentum just weeks after McMorris Rodgers and Cantwell reached a compromise on legislation that forces TikTok\u2019s Chinese owner, ByteDance, to sell the popular video-sharing app or face a ban in the U.S. President Joe Biden signed the TikTok bill into law as part of a larger national security package.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE to read the full article.\n\nCLICK HERE to learn more about how APRA is foundational to protecting kids online.\n\nCLICK HERE for how APRA will help small businesses grow and thrive.",

        "text": "Armed With New Technology And Tactics, Russian Trolls Are Back To Disrupt U.S. Elections\nArmed With New Technology And Tactics, Russian Trolls Are Back To Disrupt U.S. Elections\n\nBy National Urban League Published09 PM EST, Mon Nov 25, 2024\n\nMarc H. Morial\n\nPresident and CEO\n\nNational Urban League\n\n\n\n\u201cRussia remains the most active foreign threat to our elections. The Russian government's goals in such influence operations tend to include eroding trust in U.S. democratic institutions, exacerbating sociopolitical divisions in the United States, and degrading western support to Ukraine. Russia relies on a vast multimedia influence apparatus, which consists of its intelligence services, cyber actors, state media, proxies, and social media trolls. Moscow most likely views such operations as a means to tear down the United States as its perceived primary adversary, enabling Russia to promote itself as a great power.\u201d -- U.S. Director of National Intelligence\n\nIn the spring of 2019, the National Urban League\u2019s State of Black America report was the first to highlight the extent of Russian efforts to deceive, manipulate and exploit Black voters in the 2016 presidential election. Five months later, a Senate Intelligence Committee report confirmed our findings: Russian trolls targeted Black Americans more than any other group to dissuade them from voting.\n\nNow, as the 2024 presidential election approaches, the Russians are at it again, armed with new technology and new techniques. Videos, spewing disinformation, with voices and images manipulated by artificial intelligence, are the medium of choice for Russian operatives. Falsely represented as the work of independent journalists or whistle-blowers, the videos are considered more likely thank simple blog or social media posts to enter the mainstream discourse.\n\nThough the tactics are new, the goal remains the same: the election of Donald Trump and the implementation of Trump\u2019s pro-Russia policies. Trump has said he would encourage Russia to do \u201cwhatever the hell they want\u201d to our NATO allies who don\u2019t meet defense spending guidelines. He would end U.S. support for Ukraine in its fight against Russia\u2019s invasion.\n\nKey to Russia\u2019s disruptive plan is the promotion of racial strife and the suppression of Black votes.\n\n\u201cBy far, race and related issues were the preferred target of the information warfare campaign designed to divide the country in 2016.\u201d the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee concluded. Of Russian operatives\u2019 top 10 Instagram accounts, five were focused on African-American issues and audiences. Their Twitter content was \u201cheavily focused on hot-button issues with racial undertones such as the NFL kneeling protests.\u201d And 96 percent of their YouTube content was targeted at racial issues and police brutality. \u201cSome of the videos featured expressly voter suppressive content intended to dissuade African-American voters from participating in the 2016 presidential election,\u201d the committee found.\n\nRussia continued to target Black Americans through the 2020 presidential election.\n\nOur best defense against disinformation, national security experts say, is identifying and publicizing the propaganda push.\n\n\u201cThe great antidote to all of this is being able to shine a light on it,\u201d former NSA director Gen. Paul M. Nakasone told the Senate Intelligence Committee. \u201cIf they are trying to influence or interfere in our elections, we should make it as hard as possible for them.\u201d\n\n\n\n###\n\n21TBE 5/23/24 \u25aa 80 Pine Street \u25aa New York, NY 10005 \u25aa (212) 558-5300\n\nConnect with the National Urban League\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/NatUrbanLeague\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/naturbanleague\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/naturbanleague\n\nWebsite: https://www.NUL.org\n\nNewsletter: http://bit.ly/SubscribeNUL\n\nYouTube: http://bit.ly/YTSubNUL\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "At least 9 dead, dozens hurt after wind gust topples stage at rally for Mexican presidential candidate\nSan Pedro Garza Garcia, Mexico \u2014 A strong gust of wind toppled the stage at a campaign rally Wednesday evening in the northern Mexican state of Nuevo Leon, killing at least nine people - including a child - and injuring 63, the state's governor said.\n\nThe collapse occurred during an event attended by longshot presidential candidate Jorge \u00c1lvarez M\u00e1ynez, who ran to escape.\n\nVideos of the collapse on social media showed people screaming, running away and climbing out from under metal polls.\n\nSecurity forces stand around a stage that collapsed due to a gust of wind during an event attended by presidential candidate Jorge \u00c1lvarez M\u00e1ynez in San Pedro Garza Garc\u00eda, on the outskirts of Monterey, Mexico, on May 22, 2024. Alberto Lopez / AP\n\nThe victims \"will not be alone in this tragedy,\" M\u00e1ynez told reporters Wednesday night, adding that he had suspended upcoming campaign events.\n\nAfterward, soldiers, police and other officials roamed the grounds of the park where the event took place while many nearby sat stunned and haunted by the tragedy.\n\nMexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador said he \"sends a hug to family members, friends of the victims and political supporters.\" Condolences poured in from across Mexico, including from other presidential candidates.\n\nPresidential candidate Jorge \u00c1lvarez M\u00e1ynez, of the Citizens Movement party, speaks before the last presidential debate ahead of the presidential election at Centro Cultural Tlatelolco on May 19, 2024, in Mexico City. Manuel Velasquez / Getty Images\n\nIn a video message, Nuevo Leon Gov. Samuel Garcia, a leading member of M\u00e1ynez's Citizens Movement party, asked residents to shelter in their houses for the next two hours due to strong thunderstorms in the area.\n\nM\u00e1ynez wrote on his social media accounts that he went to a hospital after the accident in the wealthy suburb of San Pedro Garza Garcia, near the city of Monterrey. He said he was in good condition.\n\n\"The only important thing at this point is to care for the victims of the accident,\" he wrote.\n\nHe went back to the rally site after being cleared at the hospital and said he was suspending campaign activities, Reuters reported, adding that M\u00e1ynez said he hoped authorities investigate what had happened, and with transparency.\n\nVideos of the accident showed M\u00e1ynez waving his arm as the crowd chanted his name. But then he looked up to see a giant screen and metal structure toppling toward him. He ran rapidly toward the back of the stage to avoid the falling structure, which appeared to consist of relatively light framework pieces as well as what appeared to be a screen with the party's logo and theater-style lights.\n\nAgence Grance Presse reports that Jose Juan, who was at the rally, told broadcaster Televisa the structure \"hit me on the head and I fainted. The rest was pure hysteria, pure panic.\"\n\nM\u00e1ynez has been running third in polls in the presidential race, far behind both front-runner Claudia Sheinbaum of the ruling Morena Party and opposition coalition candidate X\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez. Both sent their condolences, and Sheinbaum canceled a campaign event in Monterrey the next day \"in solidarity\" with victims and their loved ones.\n\n\"My condolences and prayers with the families of the dead, and my wishes for a speedy recovery to all those injured,\" G\u00e1lvez wrote in a social media post.\n\nThe accident happened at the height of campaign season, with many events held this week and next in anticipation of the June 2 presidential, state and municipal elections.\n\nThe campaign has been plagued by the killings of about two dozen candidates for local offices. But it hasn't been marred by campaign accidents.\n\n",

        "text": "Trump's return could shake up H-1B visa system\nAs the 2024 U.S. presidential election looms, immigration attorneys are bracing for a potential second-term for former president Donald Trump, fearing swift and stringent actions that could impede employment-based immigration.\n\nTrump's first term in the White House, which ended in 2020, left H-1B visa critics disappointed because he did not deliver major reforms to the employment-based system. Instead, he significantly frustrated the H-1B process, particularly with an uptick in denials and added paperwork to support visa petitions. President Joe Biden, who took office in 2021, reversed some of these actions, making it easier to navigate the visa petition system.\n\nBut now, Trump is running for president again, and the prospect of his victory in November is alarming to immigration attorneys. They believe that a new Trump administration will be better prepared and ready to take immediate action to curb immigration, including employment-based immigration.\n\n\"I expect things will probably get worse a lot more quickly than they did the first time around,\" said Sarah Schroeder, an immigration attorney at DiRaimondo & Schroeder in New York. She said increased barriers and delays in adjudicating high-skilled worker petitions could lead to more requests for evidence, slower processing times and even efforts to block pathways to legal immigration.\n\nTo prepare for a possible Trump administration, Tahmina Watson of Watson Immigration Law in Seattle said she is \"advising all our clients that if you're eligible for something, file it now. Don't wait.\"\n\nMany people believe the Biden administration has created a more favorable climate for visa-sponsoring employers. Still, some this administration's actions might reopen political fractures over employment-based immigration that drove Trump's campaign in 2016.\n\nWhen sponsoring an employment-based green card, employers must make a good-faith effort to advertise for a U.S. worker before filling the position with a foreign worker. However, the Biden administration has proposed adding STEM occupations, possibly including computer engineering and software development, to the U.S. Department of Labor's Schedule A Shortage Occupation List. Jobs on this list are exempt from job advertising requirements.\n\nLabor objects to Biden plan The AFL-CIO, a federation of unions that represents more than 12.5 million workers, opposes expanding Schedule A. In a letter last week responding to a U.S. request for comments about the proposed expansion, the labor group cited AI-based disruptions to the tech workforce and tech layoffs as reasons for its opposition. It also said it \"has watched too many employers claim they cannot find qualified workers only to lay off their employees, including members of our unions, and require them to train their foreign replacements as a condition for their severance.\" If you're eligible for something, file it now. Don't wait. Tahmina WatsonImmigration attorney, Watson Immigration Law Despite Trump's effort as president to frustrate the H-1B system, some things have remained the same. According to the nonprofit Economic Policy Institute, major offshore outsourcing companies, including India-based Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services as well as U.S.-based Cognizant Technology Solutions, remain among the largest users of H-1B visas. Although the denial rate for initial H-1B visas reached a high of 24% in 2018, according to the American Immigration Council, a research group that supports immigration, it fell to 2% in 2022 during the Biden administration. The increased H-1B denial rate and scrutiny during the Trump administration had no effect on the annual visa cap of 85,000, which employers have filled every year. John Miano, a fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies who has represented tech workers in court over visa issues, said that Trump \"did two things in regard to H-1B that put him way ahead of his predecessors.\" First, he stopped the Tennessee Valley Authority, a federally-owned electric utility company, from turning over 200 IT jobs to contractors; and second, \"he did not make things worse,\" Miano said.",

Generate Key Takeaways\n\nElection Day 2024 is still more than five months away, but many Americans are already feeling dread about it. In a new Yahoo News/YouGov poll of 1,794 U.S. adults, a total of 60% of respondents described themselves as feeling \"very\" (29%) or \"somewhat\" (31%) anxious about the upcoming presidential election. For those who haven't been following the news, Nov. 5 will see a rematch between former President Donald Trump and incumbent President Joe Biden, with independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. hoping to siphon off voters from the two main parties.\n\nThe poll, conducted from May 10 to May 13, also sheds light on who is most stressed out. Women were slightly more likely than men to report feeling very or somewhat anxious (62% compared to 58%). Older adults also expressed more concern than younger respondents, with 72% of those age 65 and older reporting anxious feelings about the election, compared to 51% of those between the ages of 18 and 29.\n\nWhen it comes to party affiliation, Democrats and Republicans were neck and neck in terms of feeling \"somewhat\" anxious (32% for each party), though Democrats were more likely to be \"very\" anxious than their GOP counterparts (37% vs. 29%). Independents, meanwhile, were the group most likely to say they were \"not at all\" anxious about Election Day (19% compared to 12% each for Democrats and Republicans).\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nNewsletter: The Yodel Trusted news and daily delights, right in your inbox See for yourself \u2014 The Yodel is the go-to source for daily news, entertainment and feel-good stories.

Ahead of the 2016 presidential election, the American Psychological Association found that more than half of Americans considered it a \"significant source of stress.\" By 2020, that number had risen to two-thirds of U.S. adults.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cMany patients express anxiety about elections, especially those who are members of marginalized or oppressed groups,\u201d adds clinical psychologist Kate Lieberman, who notes that \u201cthis is a prevalent issue\u201d in Washington, D.C., where her practice is based. \u201cThese individuals often have legitimate concerns about the impact of elections on their rights and liberties.\u201d\n\nSelling says that he's hearing less \"doom and gloom\" thinking this election cycle and more \"dissatisfaction\" and \"disbelief\" as 2024 presents another showdown between the same candidates as 2020.\n\nWhat election anxiety might involve\n\nAccording to Lieberman, someone feeling election-related stress might show symptoms such as:\n\nIntrusive thoughts: This includes having \u201cpersistent worries about the upcoming elections, ruminating on worst-case scenarios and imagining negative outcomes,\u201d says Lieberman. \u201cThese thoughts can be overwhelming and difficult to control.\u201d\n\nCompulsive behaviors: Are you constantly monitoring social media for election-related updates, poring over the latest polls and letting the election dominate discussions with friends and family? \u201cThese behaviors may represent attempts to feel a sense of power and control, but they ultimately increase anxiety,\u201d Lieberman says.\n\nAvoidance: Not everyone with election stress obsessively follows news coverage. Lieberman points out that \u201csome individuals may steer clear of news, television or even social interactions altogether to avoid election-related conversations.\u201d Avoiding the subject may offer relief in the short term, but it can ultimately contribute to anxiety in the long run, she adds. \u201cThis is because avoidance can decrease self-efficacy and reinforce the subconscious belief that the avoided topic is too frightening to face, exacerbating feelings of helplessness and fear.\u201d\n\nPhysical symptoms: Muscle tension, an elevated heart rate, headaches and stomach issues are all physical ways in which stress might affect us, Lieberman says.\n\nCognitive symptoms: \u201cThe constant preoccupation with election-related stress can impair one's ability to function effectively in daily life,\u201d Lieberman says, citing issues such as impaired decision-making and an inability to concentrate or focus.\n\nHow to cope with election anxiety\n\nOf the 60% of respondents who said they feel anxious about the election, 15% say they deal with those feelings by avoiding all election news, while 13% avoid news about the candidates they don't plan to vote for.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAnother 11% channel those emotions into action by volunteering for a campaign or making donations for their preferred candidate \u2014 a coping strategy Lieberman says can empower voters. \u201cTaking proactive steps, such as volunteering, donating or advocating for causes and politicians you believe in, can provide a sense of agency and purpose,\u201d she says. \u201cThese activities can help individuals feel that they are contributing to positive change rather than feeling helpless.\u201d\n\nSelling encourages his patients to focus on the things they can control (like voting) and not give into worst-case-scenario thinking about how election results might impact the future.\n\nLieberman agrees. \u201cIndividuals can learn to identify and question catastrophic thinking and other cognitive biases,\u201d she explains. \u201cAlthough challenging due to the real and significant impacts elections can have, reframing thoughts to be more balanced and realistic can reduce anxiety. For example, instead of thinking, \u2018If the election doesn\u2019t go my way, everything will be terrible,\u2019 consider, \u2018While the outcome is important, I can take steps to influence my community and support the causes I care about.\u2019\u201d\n\nAvoiding alarmist narratives \u2014 whether they stem from news coverage, social media or the campaigns themselves \u2014 that promote disinformation, sow division or paint \u201ca way more cataclysmic sort of reality\u201d is also helpful, Selling says, as they \"feed the anxiety.\" It's best to be discerning and process that type of content \"with a grain of salt,\" he adds.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nLieberman suggests setting healthy boundaries. \u201cChoosing reliable sources of information and limiting the time spent on news consumption can help maintain a balanced perspective,\u201d she says. \u201cStaying informed is important, but it should be done in a way that does not dominate one\u2019s life or mental well-being. Limiting exposure to election-related coverage to specific times or days can help prevent becoming overwhelmed.\u201d\n\nSelf-care can also help, she adds. Relaxing experiences \u2014 from exercise to meditation to hobbies \u2014 and time spent with loved ones can reduce stress and help people \u201cmaintain a balanced perspective.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome back to what's joyful\u201d is what Selling tells patients. \"Focus on what is happening in your life in this moment, and focus on things that you actually can control versus putting your heart and your angst into an outcome that, aside from voting, is outside of your control.\"",

        "text": "Ohio lawmakers urged to add Biden to November's presidential ballot\nOhio lawmakers urged to add Biden to November ballot\n\nThe Biden campaign may be forced to sue the state of Ohio to get on its presidential ballot this November\n\nOn Thursday, the governor said he was calling the Legislature to convene for a rare special session to pass a law allowing Mr Biden to appear on the ballot.\n\nSuch conflicts have been quietly resolved in the past - but the Biden campaign may be forced to sue to get on the ballot.\n\nThe state's top election official said earlier this week that Democrats are nominating their candidate too late to comply with Ohio's ballot access laws.\n\nOhio's governor is pushing state lawmakers to avoid a partisan clash threatening to bar US President Joe Biden from the key swing state's presidential ballot in November.\n\nOhio requires political parties to officially confirm presidential and vice-presidential nominees to the elections chief 90 or more days before the general election.\n\nThat means Mr Biden and Kamala Harris, his vice president, must be certified as the Democratic candidates by 7 August.\n\nThough Mr Biden has secured the votes necessary for the Democratic nomination, he will not be named formally as the party's candidate until the nominating convention.\n\nBut the Democratic National Convention is from 19 to 22 August.\n\n\"The conflict between the August 7, 2024 certification deadline and the date of your party's nominating convention is well established,\" Ohio elections chief, Secretary of State Frank LaRose, wrote in a Tuesday letter to Ohio Democratic Party leadership.\n\n\"Unless your party plans to comply with the statutory deadline, I am duty-bound to instruct boards of elections to begin preparing ballots that do not include the Democratic Party's nominees for president and vice president of the United States,\" the Republican said.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican candidate, will not face the same issue. His party's national convention is 15 to 18 July, well in advance of the Ohio deadline.\n\nGovernor Mike DeWine, a moderate Republican who has distanced himself from the party's Trump-friendly wing, on Thursday said he was recalling state lawmakers to fix the \"ridiculous... absurd situation\".\n\n\u201cOhio is running out of time to get Joe Biden, the sitting President of the United States, on the ballot this fall,\" he told reporters.\n\n\"Failing to do so is simply unacceptable.\"\n\nParty conventions, both Democrat and Republican, typically are held in the summer before a presidential contest - and similar issues with certification deadlines are rectified with little drama.\n\nEarlier this year, Democrats in Washington state and Republicans in Alabama made provisional changes necessary to exempt Mr Biden from ballot deadlines.\n\nOhio itself has done the same in the past, with its Legislature making exceptions for Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee in 2012, and Mr Trump in 2020.\n\nBut the state's Republican House speaker said the body would not make a legislative fix to the issue.\n\n\"There's just not the will do that from the Legislature,\" Speaker Jason Stephens told reporters on Tuesday.\n\nThe Biden campaign is continuing to express confidence the issue will be resolved without drama.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden will be on the ballot in all 50 states,\u201d Charles Lutvak, a campaign spokesperson, told US media.\n\n\u201cElection after election, states across the country have acted in line with the bipartisan consensus and taken the necessary steps to ensure the presidential nominees from both parties will be on the ballot.\u201d\n\nBut with a legislative remedy by state Republicans off the table, the sitting US president may have to seek legal action.\n\nOhio, once viewed as a swing state, has become increasingly conservative. Mr Trump won Ohio in both 2016 and 2020, defeating Hillary Clinton and Mr Biden by roughly 8% margins both times.\n\nThe fight over Ohio's ballot comes after another partisan clash earlier this year - one that threatened Mr Trump's ballot appearance.\n\nOfficials in Colorado, Illinois and Maine ruled that the Republican was barred from returning to the White House under a Civil War-era insurrection clause in the US Constitution.\n\nThe US Supreme Court ultimately knocked down that decision in March, ruling that Mr Trump must be placed on the three states' presidential ballots.",

        "text": "Election 2024: Continuity and Change in Mexico\u2019s Political and Economic Landscape\nThe upcoming June 2 federal elections will mark a first for Mexico on many levels. Over 100 million Mexicans are set to vote for more than 20,000 federal and local posts, making these the largest elections in the country\u2019s history. Unprecedented levels of violence have also tainted the process, with organized crime assassinating over 30 local candidates and community leaders. But most notably, it will be the first time a woman will become Mexico\u2019s president.\n\nClaudia Sheinbaum, the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of outgoing populist President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (AMLO) and candidate for the leftist National Regeneration Movement (Morena), is expected to win the election. Continuing AMLO\u2019s anti-neoliberal \u201cFourth Transformation\u201d socioeconomic project is central to her campaign. Yet, kickstarting a renewables transition, promoting scientific education, and revamping Mexico\u2019s security strategy are some proposals differentiating Sheinbaum from her predecessor.\n\nTrailing Sheinbaum by double digits is X\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez, the unity candidate for the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), the National Action Party (PAN), and the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD). Undoing AMLO-era reforms and promoting middle-class-centric policies are core to her campaign. Last in the race is the Citizen Movement\u2019s (MC) candidate Jorge \u00c1lvarez M\u00e1ynez, an outsider whose appeal among millennial voters risks diluting support for the other candidates, but mainly for G\u00e1lvez.\n\nAmid this context, the electoral distribution of Congress will largely determine the next president\u2019s ability to govern. Polls suggest that Morena and its allies, the Workers Party and the Green Party, are likely to keep their absolute majority in the legislature. However, they would fall short of the three-fourths qualified majority required for substantial constitutional reforms. Therefore, if elected president, consensus-based politics are likely to define Sheinbaum\u2019s government, at least until the 2027 midterm elections.\n\nAdditionally, apart from their expected control of over half of all state legislatures, Morena and its allies lead the races for Mexico City and the governorships of Chiapas, Morelos, Puebla, Tabasco, and Veracruz. Effectively, Sheinbaum could arrive at the presidency with about two-thirds control of state governments, providing her enough political capital to implement her agenda at the local level with minor opposition.\n\nDespite this favorable electoral backdrop, Sheinbaum faces key governability obstacles. For instance, the PRI, PAN, and PRD have since 2021 progressively worked on consolidating a united opposition front. Their better-than-expected performance during the legislative midterms that year, and unity behind G\u00e1lvez\u2019s candidacy, point to a more organized effort to disrupt the \u201cFourth Transformation.\u201d It also remains uncertain to what degree the MC will align with the traditional opposition to challenge Sheinbaum\u2019s policies.\n\nMaintaining unity within Morena amid reports of brewing factionalism will also pose a challenge for Sheinbaum. Since the party\u2019s official formation in 2014, the gravitational pull of AMLO\u2019s persona has coalesced diverse stakeholders whose ideologies range from the center to far left. Failure to align conflicting party interests could jeopardize Sheinbaum\u2019s ability to govern, particularly when advancing policies that deviate from her predecessor\u2019s political line or when seeking compromise with the opposition.\n\nBeyond governability, the opposition and civil society organizations fear that AMLO, who claimed would retire from politics, will nevertheless exert undue influence in Sheinbaum\u2019s government. This is troublesome as it relates to the health of Mexico\u2019s democracy. AMLO\u2019s administration attacked the independence of the judiciary, constrained oversight agencies, and even attempted\u2014although thus far unsuccessfully\u2014to dismantle the National Electoral Institute. The erosion of checks and balances could potentially continue under Sheinbaum.\n\nOn the economic front, Sheinbaum hopes for an annual GDP growth of three percent if elected to office. Although potentially within reach in 2024, this objective is ambitious in the long run given the gradual deceleration of Mexico\u2019s economy since 2021, according to International Monetary Fund data. Likewise, despite pledging fiscal prudence, Sheinbaum\u2019s plans to finance socio-economic assistance programs, infrastructure development, and the recovery of debt-ridden state-owned oil company Pemex will continue straining an enlarged deficit.\n\nNotwithstanding the aforesaid macroeconomic outlook, the country faces a promising trade landscape. The deepening rift in U.S.-China commercial ties provides substantial momentum for nearshoring in Mexico, which, as of 2023, displaced Beijing as Washington\u2019s main trading partner. Having expressed an ambition to bolster cooperation under the USMCA, a prospective Sheinbaum administration will seek to attract greater U.S. investment flows into manufacturing and flagship projects like her renewable energy initiative.\n\nCurbing irregular migration also represents a top concern for a new president as it relates to the country\u2019s relationship with Washington. With a record 2.5 million border apprehensions in 2023, expect Mexico to continue harboring asylum seekers while cooperating with Central America to reduce crossings at its southern border. Moreover, addressing the illicit flow of U.S. weapons to Mexico, as well as the entry of fentanyl and other narcotics into the United States, will remain key priorities for the bilateral agenda.\n\nOverall, as Mexicans prepare to participate in their country\u2019s largest democratic exercise to date, an apparent desire for continuity makes Sheinbaum inch closer to the presidency. Needless to say, the June 2 federal elections have the potential to redefine the political, economic, and social future of Mexico far beyond the upcoming six-year presidential term.",

        "text": "National Debt Likely to Grow No Matter Who Wins US Presidential Election\nKey Takeaways Despite rhetoric to the contrary, the national debt has increased significantly under both Donald Trump and Joe Biden.\n\n\n\nExperts say that trend is likely to continue no matter which presumed nominee is elected in November.\n\n\n\nWhile the national debt is currently manageable, economists are growing concerned it's on an unsustainable trajectory.\n\n\n\nNo matter who wins November\u2019s presidential contest between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, forecasters see one likely outcome for the nation\u2019s finances: an ever-growing national debt that\u2019s increasingly burdensome because of high interest rates.\n\nTrump has repeatedly promised to pay off the $34.6 trillion national debt, most recently at a fundraiser in January, although hasn\u2019t specified how. For his part, Biden\u2019s White House proposed a budget this year that would reduce the budget deficit by $3 trillion over 10 years, though Congress didn\u2019t pass it into law.\n\nDespite promises, however, the government spent far more than it took in under both of them, and economists don\u2019t see any reason for that trend to reverse itself.\n\nWhile the upcoming election could be a significant one for financial issues including student loan debt, credit card fees, and taxes, the trajectory of the budget is unlikely to change much no matter which party wins.\n\n\u201cThe election could change the medium-term fiscal outlook, though potentially less than one might imagine,\u201d Alec Phillips and Tim Krupa, analysts for Goldman Sachs, wrote in a commentary earlier this month. \u201cWhile a Republican sweep would involve an extension of the expiring tax cuts, for the most part, this would simply extend current policy (and the current effect on the deficit). While a Democratic sweep would likely involve tax increases, much of this would likely go toward new spending.\u201d\n\nFederal Budget Trajectory Worries Some Forecasters\n\nThe trajectory of the budget is getting worse and is setting off more alarm bells among forecasters. The Federal Reserve\u2019s campaign of interest rate hikes meant to combat inflation has made the debt costlier to service. So much so that for the first time the U.S. will pay more on interest than it spends on defense in 2024 ($870 billion versus $822 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office.)\n\nBy some standards, the national debt is actually fairly manageable despite its immense size because the U.S. economy is so productive and growing at a healthy clip.\n\nAmong the countries of the G7\u2014a group of nations with advanced economies and democratic governments\u2014the U.S. is about the middle of the pack when it comes to the size of its debt compared to its gross domestic product.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not the current debt level that\u2019s alarming experts, but what will happen in the decades ahead. By 2054, the spending deficit will amount to 8.5% of the gross domestic product every year, a spending level only exceeded during and shortly after WWII, the Congressional Budget Office estimated in a March report.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn our view, the problem is not so much the previous debt accumulation in the United States\u2014 which is large but manageable\u2014but rather the outlook for sizable budget deficits as far as the eye can see,\u201d Michael Pugliese and Aubrey George, economists at Wells Fargo Securities, wrote in a commentary this week.\n\nExperts Say Deficit Levels Are Unsustainable\n\nThe trouble is that unless the government stops spending so much more each year than it takes in, the debt-to-GDP ratio is going to grow much larger, according to an analysis this week by economists at Deutsche Bank. Government deficits would have to run anywhere from 2.4%-4.1% of the GDP for the debt-to-GDP ratio to remain stable, they estimated. The CBO estimates deficits will be much larger than that, at around 5%-6% of GDP over the coming decades.\n\n\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and the International Monetary Fund have recently warned the U.S. is on an unsustainable trajectory with its budget. Fixing it would require balancing the books somehow, either by cutting spending or raising taxes, which are usually opposed by Democrats and Republicans, respectively.\n\nWhen lawmakers of both parties have negotiated budget deals, they typically have compromised by avoiding both spending cuts and tax increases. Meanwhile, spending on the COVID-19 pandemic and increased spending on defense have combined with higher interest rates to fuel ever-growing deficits.\n\nThe problem is a solvable one, the Wells Fargo economists concluded, given that the U.S. enjoys many financial advantages, including the fact that the dollar is the world\u2019s reserve currency and the U.S. has the world\u2019s largest and most diverse economy.\n\n\u201cFiscal consolidation via higher revenues, lower spending or some combination of the two would involve policy trade-offs but help set U.S. fiscal policy on a more sustainable path to help ensure these advantages are maintained,\u201d they wrote.\n\n",

        "text": "Polarization is getting worse: Few see shared values with those in the other party\nTwelve years later, his son President George W. Bush had the approval of the same share of Americans (34%), a CBS News/New York Times Poll found. But this time the partisan gap was even greater : 6% of Democrats approved of the way Bush was handling his job, compared with 74% of Republicans \u2014 a spread of 68 points.\n\nIn June 1992, only 34% of Americans approved of President George H.W. Bush, according to a CBS News/New York Times Poll. At that time, Bush was managing a recession, high unemployment, and a savings and loan crisis; he went on to lose the election to Clinton. There was a difference of 37 percentage points in Democrats' and Republicans' evaluations of Bush, according to the poll: 18% of Democrats approved of how Bush was handling his job, compared with 55% of Republicans.\n\nPolitical conflict between Republicans and Democrats escalated in the 1990s, when the GOP Speaker, Newt Gingrich, made it very clear that there would be conflict between the Republican majority in the House of Representatives and Democratic President Bill Clinton. Evaluations of presidents by voters diverged politically, as demonstrated by how Americans treated the two Bush presidents: one who served before Clinton and Gingrich's speakership, and one who followed them.\n\nSince then, a wide partisan gap in presidential approval has become the norm. In Economist/YouGov Polls conducted since 2009, the partisan differences in aggregated approval ratings for Presidents Barack Obama, Donald Trump, and Joe Biden have been 71, 74, and 71 points, respectively.\n\nToday, we expect to find differences between Democrats and Republicans on presidents' handling of issues \u2014 including health care policies, government spending, taxes, and wars. But the partisan gap also affects others who are close to recent presidents, even people with roles previously thought of as nonpolitical. An April Economist/YouGov poll found that First Ladies \u2014 the current one and others from the recent past \u2014 now generate similar polarization as do presidents. The gap in favorable opinion of Jill Biden between Republicans and Democrats was 70 points: 76% among Democrats and 6% of Republicans. More than three years after she left the White House, Melania Trump had a 76-point gap: 86% of Republicans but only 10% of Democrats held a favorable opinion of her.\n\nBefore Obama's presidency, First Ladies often floated above the partisan evaluations of their presidential husbands. During the George W. Bush Administration, that was true. In mid-2006, while President Bush\u2019s favorability rating was declining, his wife\u2019s rating remained high.\n\nIn June 2006, a 58% majority of Democrats had a favorable opinion of Laura Bush and there was just a 34-point difference between Republicans and Democrats, according to a Gallup/USA Today Poll \u2014 half the partisan gap in opinion about her husband, President Bush. The partisan gap was wider for Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama while they were First Ladies. Both were more active politically than many earlier First Ladies. But even their partisan gaps were narrower than Jill Biden\u2019s now.\n\nImages of the opposing party were always negative. Voting behavior is heavily partisan, as more than 90% of Democrats and of Republicans typically vote for their own party\u2019s candidates. But now, the share of people who identify with each party viewing the other party favorably is barely above 10% in aggregated Economist/YouGov Polls conducted during the Biden Administration. Favorable evaluations of the opposing party in Congress are even rarer, below 10% in recent polls.\n\nPerhaps the most notable example of polarization is how Democrats and Republicans view the people who identify with the other party. Even seeting aside their political differences with Republicans, less than half of Democrats say the two groups still share many other values and goals. And the same goes for Republicans' views of Democrats.\n\nIn March 2007, when George W. Bush was in office, more than four in 10 Democrats (46%) and more than four in 10 Republicans (43%) said that despite their political differences with people who identified with the opposite party, they still shared many other values and goals with people in the opposite party, according to the CBS News/New York Times Poll. However, at least half of each party\u2019s identifiers \u2014 51% of Democrats and 53% of Republicans \u2014 said they did not. An even higher share of Republican conservatives felt Democratic Party identifiers shared few values with them.\n\nIn the 17 years since then, the gap has only widened, with Republicans becoming more skeptical than Democrats. An Economist/YouGov Poll conducted in late April asked a question similar to the 2007 poll and found that about one-third of Democrats now believe Republicans share their nonpolitical values, and only one-quarter of Republicans say the same about Democrats. Fewer than one in five Republicans who identify as MAGA say that. Liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans are more negative about the opposing party than moderates in either party.",

        "text": "Ohio lawmakers urged to add Biden to November's presidential ballot\nOhio requires political parties to officially confirm presidential and vice-presidential nominees to the elections chief 90 or more days before the general election.\n\nThat means Mr Biden and Kamala Harris, his vice president, must be certified as the Democratic candidates by 7 August.\n\nThough Mr Biden has secured the votes necessary for the Democratic nomination, he will not be named formally as the party's candidate until the nominating convention.\n\nBut the Democratic National Convention is from 19 to 22 August.\n\n\"The conflict between the August 7, 2024 certification deadline and the date of your party's nominating convention is well established,\" Ohio elections chief, Secretary of State Frank LaRose, wrote in a Tuesday letter to Ohio Democratic Party leadership.\n\n\"Unless your party plans to comply with the statutory deadline, I am duty-bound to instruct boards of elections to begin preparing ballots that do not include the Democratic Party's nominees for president and vice president of the United States,\" the Republican said.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican candidate, will not face the same issue. His party's national convention is 15 to 18 July, well in advance of the Ohio deadline.\n\nGovernor Mike DeWine, a moderate Republican who has distanced himself from the party's Trump-friendly wing, on Thursday said he was recalling state lawmakers to fix the \"ridiculous... absurd situation\".\n\n\u201cOhio is running out of time to get Joe Biden, the sitting President of the United States, on the ballot this fall,\" he told reporters.\n\n\"Failing to do so is simply unacceptable.\"\n\nParty conventions, both Democrat and Republican, typically are held in the summer before a presidential contest - and similar issues with certification deadlines are rectified with little drama.\n\nEarlier this year, Democrats in Washington state and Republicans in Alabama made provisional changes necessary to exempt Mr Biden from ballot deadlines.\n\nOhio itself has done the same in the past, with its Legislature making exceptions for Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee in 2012, and Mr Trump in 2020.\n\nBut the state's Republican House speaker said the body would not make a legislative fix to the issue.\n\n\"There's just not the will do that from the Legislature,\" Speaker Jason Stephens told reporters on Tuesday.\n\nThe Biden campaign is continuing to express confidence the issue will be resolved without drama.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden will be on the ballot in all 50 states,\u201d Charles Lutvak, a campaign spokesperson, told US media.\n\n\u201cElection after election, states across the country have acted in line with the bipartisan consensus and taken the necessary steps to ensure the presidential nominees from both parties will be on the ballot.\u201d\n\nBut with a legislative remedy by state Republicans off the table, the sitting US president may have to seek legal action.\n\nOhio, once viewed as a swing state, has become increasingly conservative. Mr Trump won Ohio in both 2016 and 2020, defeating Hillary Clinton and Mr Biden by roughly 8% margins both times.\n\nThe fight over Ohio's ballot comes after another partisan clash earlier this year - one that threatened Mr Trump's ballot appearance.\n\nOfficials in Colorado, Illinois and Maine ruled that the Republican was barred from returning to the White House under a Civil War-era insurrection clause in the US Constitution.\n\nThe US Supreme Court ultimately knocked down that decision in March, ruling that Mr Trump must be placed on the three states' presidential ballots.",

        "text": "President Ebrahim Raisi\u2019s Death: What Are the Political and International Perspectives for the Islamic Republic of Iran?\nPresident Ebrahim Raisi\u2019s Death: What Are the Political and International Perspectives for the Islamic Republic of Iran?\n\nInterview Le point de vue de Thierry Coville\n\nThe disappearance of Iran\u2019s President and Foreign Minister on May 19th, 2024 in a helicopter crash has sent shockwaves through the country. Against a backdrop of regional destabilisation and renewed tensions, particularly with Israel, the election of a new president is imperative, and the death of Ebrahim Raissi also raises questions about Supreme Leader Ali Khameini\u2019s future prospects for the country. What reactions has the death of the President provoked among the Iranian people? In the run-up to the presidential elections on 28 June, what are the political and geopolitical prospects for Iran? Thierry Coville, Research Fellow at IRIS, provides some answers.The news of President Ebrahim Raisi\u2019s death on May 19th, 2024 after a helicopter crash in Iran\u2019s East Azerbaijan province came as a political shock, as it would have in any country where a similar incident had taken place. The first reaction of the authorities, and in particular of the Leader Ali Khameini, was to assure them that there would be no consequences for the running of the country. The first vice-president, Mohamed Mokhber, was appointed as interim president pending new presidential elections at the end of June 2024. It should be noted that he was the director of one of Iran\u2019s largest foundations (bonyads), Setad Edjr\u00e2i Farman Imam, i.e. parastatal bodies which own numerous companies, pay no tax and report only to the Leader. This appointment therefore confirms the economic and political weight of this parastatal sector (comprising the bonyads and companies working for the Pasdaran) in the Islamic Republic of Iran. An investigation has also been launched by the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces, Mohamad B\u00e2qeri, to determine the causes of the accident. All that can be said on this subject is that Iran\u2019s civil and military air fleet is ageing (one of the \u00ab oldest \u00bb in the world\u2026): US sanctions are limiting Iran\u2019s ability to purchase aircraft and spare parts. It should be remembered that US sanctions are preventing Iran from buying Airbus, since at least 10% of the components for this aircraft are manufactured in the United States. There is therefore a real risk to passenger safety: the Aviation Safety Network noted in 2022 that there had been nearly 1,800 accidents since the revolution.During his presidency, Ebrahim Raisi has shown himself to be a faithful executor of the directives of the Guide Ali Khameini. Unlike previous presidents, there was not a single moment when there was any sign of disagreement between the Guide and Ebrahim Raisi. Obviously, the President will be remembered for his ferocious repression of the \u00ab Women, Life, Freedom \u00bb protest movement in 2022 (with more than 500 people killed on the demonstrators\u2019 side), and for his inability to provide any response other than a security response to this crisis. This repression accentuated the \u00ab rifts \u00bb in Iranian society and explains why a number of people, in particular members of the families of the victims of this repression, openly rejoiced at the death of the President. Other critics focus on his economic policy. Ebrahim Raissi was elected on the promise that he would improve Iran\u2019s economic situation, explaining that the former president, Hassan Rohani, was wrong to link all the difficulties facing the Iranian economy to the re-imposition of US sanctions after Donald Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the agreement in 2018. However, despite these promises, inflation has remained very high in Iran since his election: it has been close to 50% since 2021, but has slowed to almost 30% at the beginning of 2024. Ebrahim Raissi therefore found himself at odds with his pre-election rhetoric, only to find that he could not really reduce inflation as long as US sanctions were in place. The Iranian President can also be accused of making mistakes in terms of economic policy, such as abolishing foreign exchange subsidies on imports of essential products in 2022 (wheat, oil, medicines), which has led to an acceleration of already high inflation.We must remain cautious on this subject. It is true that Ebrahim Raisi was mentioned as one of the possible candidates to succeed Leader Ali Khameini. On the other hand, he was not the only one. Some also believe that his \u00ab poor \u00bb economic record as President may have weighed on his credibility as the Guide\u2019s future replacement. On the other hand, since the 1979 revolution, certain personalities have often been mentioned as possible successors to the Leader, only to find that these same people had fallen from grace some time later. What is certain is that Guide Ali Khameini\u2019s succession, when it comes, will be a major event on the Iranian political scene. In this respect, it is worth noting that the Assembly of Experts, whose mission is to choose the new Leader and of which Ebrahim Raisi was a member, has just held its first meeting after the March 2024 elections, which defined its new composition. All its members agree on a radical political line, defending above all the principle of Velayat-eh faqih (the superiority of the religious over the political) and all personalities who do not meet this condition, such as former President Hassan Rohani, have been excluded.As far as the forthcoming presidential elections are concerned, everything will depend on the choices made by the Leader Ali Khameini. If he considers that the country\u2019s overall strategy should remain the same, then he will favour the candidacy of a profile similar to that of Ebrahim Raisi, i.e. a radical who will continue the policies pursued previously, particularly in terms of repression and the compulsory veiling of women. Alternatively, he may feel that the political crisis that Iran has been experiencing since 2022 should not be allowed to continue, and that it is therefore necessary to appoint someone capable of taking a slightly more pragmatic approach capable of limiting the rift between the government and a large part of society, while maintaining the ongoing dialogue with the United States on regional conflicts and nuclear issues. In any case, the future president will be close to the radical line defending the Velayat-eh faqih.This remains unlikely. Iran\u2019s regional strategy is primarily defined by Ali Khameini and his advisers. In fact, Ali Bagheri Kani, who was appointed as interim foreign minister after the death of Hossein Amir Abdollahian (who also died in the helicopter crash), can be considered to be part of the movement defending the Velayat-eh faqih and the \u00ab Axis of Resistance \u00bb. He was campaign manager for Said Djalili, a well-known figure in this movement, during the 2013 presidential elections. He was also in charge of nuclear negotiations in the Raissi government, which shows just how important this issue remains for Iran.Iran\u2019s international strategy will continue to be marked by the objective of defending the Axis of Resistance, while gradually strengthening its previously strained ties with Gulf Cooperation Council countries such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait. On the international stage, the priority is to maintain contacts with the United States, in particular to limit the risk of conflicts in the region \u00ab getting out of hand \u00bb and with a view to \u00ab future \u00bb negotiations on the nuclear issue. It is worth noting that all the leaders of this \u00ab Axis of Resistance \u00bb were present at Ebrahim Raissi\u2019s funeral in Tehran and that Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait sent their foreign ministers.Translated by Deepl.",

        "text": "Soon after Nikki Haley said she'd vote for Trump, Biden campaign met with her supporters\nNikki Haley commits to voting for Trump but stands by prior criticism of him\n\nSoon after former GOP presidential candidate Nikki Haley announced Wednesday she would vote for former President Donald Trump this November, the Biden campaign held a virtual meeting with her supporters on that very evening.\n\nSeveral Haley supporters, including some of her former state leadership team and members of the \"Women for Nikki\" coalition, joined the call from across the country. The meeting was arranged by Robert Schwartz, the executive director of the anti-Trump Haley Voters Working Group.\n\nThe deputy political director of the Biden campaign, Juan Pe\u00f1alosa, joined the call to stress how important the Haley coalition's support would be to defeating Trump and addressed the differences Haley supporters have with Mr. Biden, according to Schwartz. He said that while some of Haley's voters might be open to voting for the president, there are strong policy disagreements.\n\n\"A lot of them have not said that they're going to vote for Joe Biden; a lot of them are actually considering writing in Nikki Haley,\" Schwartz said. \"There's a wide range of views, but it's certainly not preaching to the converted.\"\n\nAlthough she dropped her presidential bid in March, Haley has still managed to attract hundreds of thousands of votes across several Republican primaries, including in key swing states.\n\nIn Pennsylvania's Republican primary in April, over 157,000 voted for Haley, representing roughly 16% of the total share of vote. In Wisconsin, also in April, Haley finished with almost 13% of the GOP primary vote, close to 77,000. Mr. Biden, who has been trailing Trump in recent polling in these states, won both in 2020, but his margin of victory was very slim \u2014 about 21,000 in Wisconsin, and around 82,000 in Pennsylvania.\n\nSchwartz says he shared a list of issues that are priorities for Haley supporters with the Biden campaign, like supporting Israel and addressing the crisis at the U.S. southern border. He added that he's been working with Biden's reelection team to gather information about what it was about Haley that appealed to these Republican voters and what messages would be likely to resonate with them.\n\nAfter Haley announced she'd vote for Trump, one former Haley volunteer, Alissa Baker, who's a member of the working group said she remains opposed to Trump.\n\n\"As a private citizen, she has to make the same choices that we do,\" Baker said. \"She gave her reason, and I respect that. I also respect that she isn't endorsing or telling her supporters how to vote. It doesn't change my thinking on how I will vote in November at this point.\"\n\nIn an email Thursday, the Biden campaign said of its collaboration with Haley Voters Working Group, \"While Donald Trump continues to attack moderate Republican and independent voters, the Biden campaign is investing to talk to these voters and working to earn their support.\"\n\nAaron Navarro contributed to this story.",

        "text": "1976 United States presidential election\nPresidential elections were held in the United States on November 2, 1976. Democratic nominee, former Georgia governor Jimmy Carter, narrowly defeated incumbent Republican President Gerald Ford. This was the first presidential election since 1932 in which the incumbent was defeated, as well as the only Democratic victory of the six such presidential elections between 1968 and 1988.\n\nFord ascended to the presidency when Richard Nixon resigned in 1974 in the wake of the Watergate scandal, which badly damaged the Republican Party and its electoral prospects. Ford promised to continue Nixon's political agenda and govern as a moderate Republican, causing considerable backlash from the conservative wing of his party. This spurred former California governor Ronald Reagan to mount a significant challenge against him in the Republican primaries, in which Ford narrowly prevailed.[2] Carter was unknown outside of his home state of Georgia at the start of the Democratic primaries, but he emerged as the front-runner after his victories in the first set of primaries. Campaigning as a political moderate within his own party and as a Washington outsider, Carter defeated numerous opponents to clinch the Democratic nomination.[3]\n\nFord pursued a \"Rose Garden strategy\" in which he sought to portray himself as an experienced leader focused on fulfilling his role as chief executive.[4] On the other hand, Carter emphasized his status as a reformer who was \"untainted\" by Washington.[5] Saddled with a poor economy, the fall of South Vietnam, and the political fallout from the Watergate Scandal, including his unpopular pardon of Richard Nixon, Ford trailed by a wide margin in polls taken after Carter's formal nomination in July 1976. Ford's polling rebounded after a strong performance in the first presidential debate, and the race was close on election day.\n\nCarter won a majority of the popular and electoral votes. He was able to carry several Midwestern and Northeastern swing states, as well as all the Southern states except for Oklahoma and Virginia. Ford dominated the Western states. Carter's victory at the polls was due in part to the backlash against the Watergate scandal that still was deeply hurting Republican candidates, and with Carter's rhetoric of honesty and compassion resonating with many of those voters who felt distrustful of politics post-Watergate. Ford also suffered from the popular lampooning of him as a stumbling boob by Chevy Chase on Saturday Night Live despite the fact that he had been an All-American football player at the University of Michigan. Ford became the first president to ever fail to win a national election as president or vice president (he was appointed VP in 1973 after the resignation of Spiro Agnew and ascended to President in 1974 with the resignation of President Richard Nixon).\n\nAs of 2024, this is also the last election in which the Democratic candidate won the majority of states in the South, carrying the states of Alabama, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Texas (mainly due to Carter's southern roots), and the most recent election in which the losing candidate carried more states than the winning candidate. This is the only election in which California voted Republican while Ohio voted Democrat, the last time West Virginia went Democratic by more than 15 points, as well as this, and 1988 being the only elections Democrats did better in Maine's 2nd District than in the 1st.\n\nNominations [ edit ]\n\nDemocratic Party [ edit ]\n\nThe surprise winner of the 1976 Democratic presidential nomination was Jimmy Carter, a former state senator and governor of Georgia. When the primaries began, Carter was little-known at the national level, and many political pundits regarded a number of better-known candidates, such as Senator Henry M. Jackson from Washington, Representative Morris Udall from Arizona, Governor George Wallace of Alabama, and California Governor Jerry Brown, as the favorites for the nomination. However, in the wake of the Watergate scandal, Carter realized that his status as a Washington outsider, political centrist, and moderate reformer could give him an advantage over his better-known establishment rivals. Carter also took advantage of the record number of state primaries and caucuses in 1976, to eliminate his better-known rivals one-by-one.\n\nHenry M. Jackson made a fateful decision not to compete in the early Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary, which Jimmy Carter won after liberals split their votes among four other candidates. Though Jackson went on to win the Massachusetts and New York primaries, he was forced to quit the race on May 1, after losing the critical Pennsylvania primary to Carter by twelve percentage points. Carter then defeated Governor Wallace, his main conservative challenger, by a wide margin in the North Carolina primary, thus forcing Wallace to end his campaign. Representative Udall, a liberal, then became Carter's main challenger. He finished second to Carter in the New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Wisconsin, New York, Michigan, South Dakota, and Ohio primaries, and won the caucuses in his home state of Arizona, while running even with Carter in the New Mexico caucuses. However, the fact that Udall finished second to Carter in most of these races meant that Carter steadily accumulated more delegates for the nomination than he did.\n\nAs Carter closed in on the nomination, an \"ABC\" (\"Anybody But Carter\") movement started among Northern and Western liberal Democrats who worried that Carter's Southern upbringing would make him too conservative for the Democratic Party. The leaders of the \"ABC\" movement, Idaho Senator Frank Church and California Governor Jerry Brown, both announced their candidacies for the Democratic nomination, and defeated Carter in several late primaries. However, their campaigns started too late to prevent Carter from gathering the remaining delegates he needed to capture the nomination.\n\nBy June 1976, Carter had captured more than enough delegates to win the Democratic nomination. At the 1976 Democratic National Convention, Carter easily won the nomination on the first ballot; Udall finished in second place. Carter then chose Minnesota Senator Walter Mondale, a liberal, as his running mate.\n\nRepublican Party [ edit ]\n\nCandidates in this section are sorted by date of withdrawal from the nomination race Ronald Reagan Governor of California\n\n(1967\u20131975) Campaign LN : August 19, 1976\n\n4,760,222 votes\n\nThe contest for the Republican Party's presidential nomination in 1976 was between two serious candidates: incumbent president Gerald Ford, a member of the party's moderate wing, and former governor of California Ronald Reagan, a member of the party's conservative wing. The presidential primary campaign between the two men was hard-fought and relatively even; by the start of the Republican Convention in August 1976, the race for the nomination was still too close to call. Ford defeated Reagan by a narrow margin on the first ballot at the 1976 Republican National Convention in Kansas City, and chose Senator Bob Dole from Kansas as his running mate in the place of incumbent vice president Nelson Rockefeller, who had announced the previous year that he was not interested in being considered for the vice presidential nomination.[6] The 1976 Republican Convention was the last political convention to open with the presidential nomination still being undecided until the actual balloting at the convention.\n\nOthers [ edit ]\n\nGeneral election [ edit ]\n\nPolling [ edit ]\n\nFall campaign [ edit ]\n\nOne of the advantages Ford held over Carter as the general election campaign began was his presidential privilege to preside over events celebrating the United States Bicentennial; this often resulted in favorable publicity for Ford. These included the Washington, D. C., fireworks display on the Fourth of July, which was televised nationally.[36] On July 7, 1976, the President and First Lady served as hosts at a White House state dinner for Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip of the United Kingdom, which was televised on the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) network. These events were part of Ford's \"Rose Garden\" strategy to win the election, meaning that instead of appearing as a typical politician, Ford presented himself as a \"tested leader\" who was busily fulfilling the role of national leader and chief executive. Not until October did Ford leave the White House to actively campaign across the nation.[citation needed]\n\nCarter ran as a reformer who was \"untainted\" by Washington political scandals,[37] which many voters found attractive in the wake of the Watergate scandal that had led to President Richard Nixon's resignation. Ford, although personally unconnected with Watergate, was seen by many as too close to the discredited Nixon administration, especially after he granted Nixon a presidential pardon for any crimes he might have committed during his term of office. Ford's pardon of Nixon caused his popularity, as measured by public opinion polls, to plummet. Ford's refusal to explain his reasons for pardoning Nixon publicly (he would do so in his memoirs several years later), also hurt his image.[citation needed]\n\nFord unsuccessfully asked Congress to end the 1950s-era price controls on natural gas, which had caused a dwindling of American natural gas reserves after the 1973 oil crisis.[38] Carter stated during his campaign that he opposed the ending of the price controls and thought such a move would be \"disastrous\".[39]\n\nAfter the Democratic National Convention, Carter held a 33-point lead over Ford in the polls.[40] However, as the campaign continued, the race greatly tightened. During the campaign Playboy magazine published a controversial interview with Carter; in the interview, Carter admitted to having \"lusted in my heart\" for women other than his wife and used the word \"screw,\" which cut into his support among women and evangelical Christians.[41] On September 23, Ford performed well in what was the first televised presidential debate since 1960. Polls taken after the debate showed that most viewers felt that Ford was the winner. Carter was also hurt by Ford's charges that he lacked the necessary experience to be an effective national leader and that he was vague on many issues.[citation needed]\n\nCarter campaign headquarters\n\nHowever, Ford also committed a costly blunder in the campaign that halted his momentum. During the second presidential debate on October 6, Ford stumbled when he asserted that \"there is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe, and there never will be under a Ford administration\". He added that he did not \"believe that the Poles consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union\", and made the same claim with regard to Yugoslavia and Romania (Yugoslavia was not a Warsaw Pact member).[42] Ford refused to retract his statement for almost a week after the debate, causing his surge in the polls to stall and allowing Carter to maintain a slight lead in the polls.[citation needed]\n\nA vice-presidential debate, the first formal one of its kind,[43] between Bob Dole and Walter Mondale also hurt the Republican ticket when Dole asserted that military unpreparedness on the part of Democratic presidents was responsible for all of the wars the U.S. had fought in the 20th century. Dole, a World War II veteran, noted that in every 20th-century war, from World War I to the Vietnam War, a Democrat had been president. Dole then pointed out that the number of U.S. casualties in \"Democrat wars\" was roughly equal to the population of Detroit. Many voters felt that Dole's criticism was unfairly harsh, and that his dispassionate delivery made him seem cold. Years later, Dole would remark that he regretted the comment, believing that it had hurt the Republican ticket.[44] One factor that did help Ford in the closing days of the campaign was a series of popular television appearances he did with Joe Garagiola, a retired baseball player for the St. Louis Cardinals and a well-known announcer for NBC Sports. Garagiola and Ford appeared in a number of shows in several large cities. During the show, Garagiola would ask Ford questions about his life and beliefs; the shows were so informal, relaxed, and laid-back that some television critics labelled them the \"Joe and Jerry Show\". Ford and Garagiola obviously enjoyed one another's company, and they remained friends after the election was over.[citation needed]\n\nPresidential debates [ edit ]\n\nThere were three presidential debates and one vice presidential debate during the 1976 general election.[45][46]\n\nResults [ edit ]\n\nDespite his campaign's blunders, Ford managed to close the remaining gap in the polls, and by election day, the race was judged to be even. It took most of that night and the following morning to determine the winner. It was not until 3:30 am EST that NBC was able to declare that Carter had carried Mississippi and had thus accumulated more than the 270 electoral votes needed to win. Seconds later, ABC News also declared Carter the winner, based on projections for Carter in Wisconsin and Hawaii, while CBS News announced Carter's victory at 3:45 am.[48] Carter defeated Ford by two percentage points in the national popular vote.\n\nThe electoral vote was the closest since 1916; Carter carried 23 states, with 297 electoral votes, while Ford won 27 states, with 240 electoral votes (one elector, future state Senator Mike Padden from Washington state, pledged to Ford, voted for Reagan[49]). Carter's victory came primarily from his near-sweep of the South (he lost only Virginia and Oklahoma), and his narrow victories in large Northern states such as New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. Ford did well in the West, carrying every state in that region, except for Hawaii. The most tightly contested state in the election was Oregon, which Ford won by under 2,000 votes.\n\nBy percentage of the vote, the states that secured Carter's victory were Wisconsin (1.68% margin) and Ohio (.27% margin). Had Ford won these states and all other states he carried, he would have won the presidency. The 27 states he won were, and still are, the most states ever carried by a losing candidate for president. Had Ford won the election, the provisions of the 22nd Amendment would have disqualified him from running in 1980, as he served more than two years of Nixon's second term.\n\nRecords [ edit ]\n\nCarter was the first Democratic presidential nominee since John F. Kennedy in 1960 to carry states in the Deep South (Bill Clinton was the only Democrat since 1976 to carry more than one state from the Deep South, doing so in 1992), and the only one since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964 to carry a majority of all southern states. Carter performed very strongly in his home state of Georgia, carrying 66.7% of the vote and every county in the state. His winning of 23 states was only the second time in history that the winner of the election won fewer than half the states (after 1960). His 50.1% of the vote was the only time since 1964 that a Democrat managed to obtain an absolute majority of the popular vote in a presidential election until Barack Obama won 52.9% of the vote in 2008. Carter is one of six Democrats since the American Civil War to obtain an absolute majority of the popular vote, the others being Samuel J. Tilden, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Lyndon B. Johnson, Barack Obama, and Joe Biden.\n\nThis election represents the last time to date that Texas, Mississippi, Alabama, and South Carolina would vote Democratic, and the last time North Carolina would vote Democratic until 2008, as well as the last time Florida voted Democratic until 1996, and the last time Arkansas, Delaware, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee voted Democratic until 1992.[50]\n\nThis election was the last time that a Democrat won the presidency without winning a number of modern blue states and swing states, specifically California, Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington. This is the only time a Democrat has won without New Mexico, as well as the only time it voted for a candidate who lost the popular vote. Similarly, it is one of only three instances in which a Democrat won without Nevada (the others being the two elections of Grover Cleveland in 1884 and 1892). The Democrats did not win without Iowa again until 2020.\n\nIt was the first time in exactly 100 years when Florida and Virginia supported different candidates, and the first time since Oklahoma statehood in 1907 when Oklahoma and Tennessee did so.\n\nAs Carter won 319 more counties than Ford, this election would mark the last time a Democrat won a majority of counties.\n\nStatistics [ edit ]\n\nSource (Popular Vote): Leip, David. \"1976 Presidential Election Results\".

        "text": "Strong peso, stubborn inflation cloud Mexico\u2019s 2024 growth prospects\nStrong peso, stubborn inflation cloud Mexico\u2019s 2024 growth prospects\n\nJesus Ca\u00f1as, Luis Torres and Diego Morales-Burnett\n\nMexican economic performance is likely to slow in 2024, with stubborn inflation, rising labor costs and a strong peso posing downside risks. Conversely, nearshoring and a larger-than-expected fiscal impact could bolster the Mexican outlook.\n\nDespite nascent nearshoring trade expectations, the Mexican economy will be challenged by a welter of economic issues during the second half of 2024. The most notable are a still-restrictive interest-rate environment even as Banco de M\u00e9xico has begun easing monetary policy, a strong peso and soaring labor costs. Potential economic softening in the U.S. further complicates the outlook.\n\nLong-run challenges also remain, such as reversal of earlier energy sector reforms, poor productivity growth and high crime and violence.\n\nHowever, Mexican government spending and the possibility of more fulsome nearshoring of manufacturing operations or suppliers could help the country consolidate its position as the main supplier to the U.S. market and aid prospects for 2024.\n\nReal (inflation-adjusted) GDP growth is expected to moderate to 2.0 percent in 2024, down from 2.5 percent in 2023 (Chart 1). Domestic investment and consumption drove performance in 2023, with notable strength in the service sector, construction and auto production.\n\nDownloadable chart\n\nGovernment outlays support short-run growth\n\nMexico\u2019s 2024 federal budget projects government spending rising to 26.4 percent of GDP from 25.6 percent of GDP in 2023 and from a 10-year average of 24.7 percent of GDP. Social programs remain a priority, representing about 50 percent of the total budget. The main federal social programs are pensions for the elderly, school rehabilitation and basic education scholarships, and reforestation and development of sustainable rural communities.\n\nThe government\u2019s revenue estimate is conservative. Notably, oil sales assume a price of $57 per barrel compared with the early 2024 price of Mexican mix near $70 per barrel. If oil remains elevated, the government may seek to spend even more than originally planned. Either way, unusually high and growing government spending could fuel inflationary pressures.\n\nAnticipating the impact of nearshoring\n\nThere is expectation that nearshoring could significantly benefit Mexico\u2019s economy and deepen the U.S.\u2013Mexico economic partnership. Nearshoring is the relocation of company operations and supply chains from overseas to North America, principally from China to Mexico.\n\nHigher U.S. tariffs on goods from China and U.S. industrial policy favoring North American production and inputs have helped reshape some global value chains in ways that may benefit Mexico.\n\nSupply-chain dislocation during the pandemic has also lent urgency to the idea of derisking supply chains by bringing them closer to their ultimate destination, generally the U.S.\n\nMexico surpassed China as the main manufacturing trading partner of the U.S. in 2022 and was the principal trading partner in 2023 (Chart 2). If this trend continues, it will produce positive economic spillovers within Mexican manufacturing, expanding into the services sector and contributing to higher growth levels in 2024 and beyond.\n\nDownloadable chart\n\nRecent Georgetown University research shows that before 2022, nearshoring had increased Mexico GDP around 1 percent. The rise is in part attributable to higher exports of computer and peripheral equipment, semiconductors and other electronic components. Georgetown researchers estimate a 0.8 percent GDP increase in the succeeding years. When adding up the effects, nearshoring could bring an overall increase of almost 2 percent to Mexico\u2019s GDP.\n\nMexican manufacturing shows signs of bulking up\n\nThere are also initial signs of nearshoring activity at the company level resulting from U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods that began in 2018. Firms that are part of the Mexican government\u2019s Manufacturing, Maquila and Export Services Industry Program (IMMEX) and are part of global value chains have increased exports to the U.S. in skill and technology-intensive industries. They include chemicals, computers, aircraft and automotive. Overall, IMMEX firms are exporting more final goods.\n\nAdditionally, research by Mexico\u2019s central bank found that after June 2020, manufacturing industries prone to relocating operations to Mexico from China, such as electric and electronic components, office equipment, and machinery and equipment, have exhibited higher levels of production and employment than other firms. Researchers pointed to signs the relocation process is slowly occurring in regions that traditionally receive greater flows of foreign direct investment, areas in the north and central parts of Mexico.\n\nHowever, the expected increase in nearshoring-related foreign direct investment isn\u2019t yet readily apparent. Foreign direct investment fell in 2023 despite slight gains in manufacturing, ending a slide that began in 2016 (Chart 3).\n\nDownloadable chart\n\nReinvestment of profits in the same facilities accounted for much of the marginal manufacturing investment increase. Manufacturing companies are first expanding existing capacity, Dallas Fed contacts say, adding production lines, buying new equipment and adding employees. Companies are quick to announce new projects; however, it is unclear how many will be subsequently scaled back, delayed or canceled.\n\nElevated inflation among short-term challenges\n\nLess restrictive monetary policy should boost Mexico\u2019s economic growth this year, although the impact may be muted, given policymakers\u2019 cautious approach. Banco de M\u00e9xico lowered its reference rate 25 basis points (0.25 percentage points) to 11 percent in March and held it in April, marking the end of the tightening cycle. The central bank had kept its policy rate unchanged for seven consecutive meetings, beginning in March 2023. The central bank is expected to favor a restrictive monetary policy stance due to persistent inflation concerns.\n\nInflation soared with the pandemic, reaching an annual rate of almost 9 percent, and the central bank\u2019s proactive policy stance has helped reduce inflation. CPI core inflation, which excludes food and energy, has declined since early 2023. However, services inflation persists, keeping overall inflation above the central bank\u2019s 3 percent target rate (Chart 4).\n\nDownloadable chart\n\nThe central bank has indicated the reference rate will remain elevated, as inflation isn\u2019t likely to converge with the target rate until the second quarter of 2025, signaling that the reference rate will remain high for some time. As a result, borrowing costs will stay elevated, damping investment and consumption this year.\n\nHigh interest-rate differentials relative to the U.S. have also contributed to the peso appreciation. The Mexican peso has gained around 18 percent against the dollar in the past two years. A sustained appreciation of the peso boosts the relative cost of exports and reduces the cost of imports and could slow growth. The strong peso stymies tourism and foreign investment. Relocation of supply chains to include Mexico has offset some of the negative effects.\n\nThe strong peso also means dollar remittances are worth less to their recipients in Mexico. Despite record nominal remittances from Mexican citizens working in the U.S., the value of the payments has declined in real terms, which adjust for inflation and peso appreciation. While average dollar-denominated monthly remittances rose from $389 in 2022 to $393 in 2023, in real pesos they fell from 6,391 pesos to 5,398 pesos, a 16 percent drop.\n\nRising labor costs outrun productivity\n\nLabor costs are rising faster than labor productivity, posing another challenge. Mexico\u2019s government has increased the federal minimum wage 88 percent in real terms over the past five years. The increases, at the start of each year, have been implemented annually.\n\nAlthough the majority of workers in the formal sector\u2014which the government can directly influence\u2014earn more than minimum wage, it\u2019s a reference wage that drives other labor costs and can push up prices (Chart 5). As a result, average daily wages in the formal sector increased 14 percent in real terms between 2019 and 2023.\n\nDownloadable chart\n\nHigher worker compensation is a benefit for workers and not a concern for firms and consumers if labor productivity gains match rising labor costs. But labor costs have increased faster than worker productivity in manufacturing and services since 2019. Unit labor costs increased 1.8 times faster than labor productivity in manufacturing and 1.5 times faster in services on a monthly, annual average basis.\n\nWhen labor costs rise faster than labor productivity, they can impede hiring and lower the competitiveness of domestic and international firms in Mexico. The situation can also drive up hiring in the informal sector that is less compliant with minimum wage regulations.\n\nResearch by Mexico\u2019s central bank finds a negative relationship between formal sector employment growth and federally mandated minimum wage increases. The study highlights the need to adopt measures that can increase labor productivity\u2014the only way to sustainably create better-paying jobs.\n\nEnergy sector, fiscal discipline pose challenges to long-run growth\n\nMexico\u2019s energy sector faces a number of barriers, particularly following the recent reversal of reforms enacted in the previous decade that had upended state-owned oil and electricity monopolies. Energy prices have risen amid lapses in reliability, particularly affecting manufacturing.\n\nA lack of reliable and affordable electricity could damp nearshoring momentum. (Separately, Dallas Fed contacts have also noted the importance of providing access to plentiful and reliable water supplies.)\n\nWhile fiscal spending boosts the economy, this year\u2019s outsized expenditures represent a possible deviation from the fiscal prudence that characterized Mexican administrations since the 1990s. Some analysts see signals of structural change in fiscal discipline; others view the spending as temporary, no different than peer nations that didn\u2019t experience any impact on country risk valuations.\n\nThe federal budget deficit this year is expected to be 5.4 percent of GDP, the largest since 1988. Much of it has been used to fund social spending programs and infrastructure projects.\n\nThere can be long-run benefits from fiscal spending, particularly if it represents investment in human capital and results in higher educational attainment and better health. Well-conceived infrastructure projects can also boost productivity and economic growth.\n\nConversely, a recent Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas Southwest Economy report documents Mexico\u2019s long history of disappointing productivity growth. The article notes that with labor force growth slowing, the nation must invest more in education and advanced technology in order to sustain future economic growth.\n\nCrime, violence deter economic growth\n\nHigh levels of violence and, more generally, criminal activity are obstacles to economic activity and foreign and domestic investment and ultimately long-run growth. Homicides have averaged 35,500 per year over the past four years, an increase of 25 percent from the previous four years (Chart 6).\n\nDownloadable chart\n\nMexico\u2019s homicide rate of 28 per 100,000 population compares with the global average of 6 per 100,000, the U.S. at 7 per 100,000 and Latin America and the Caribbean at 20 per 100,000.\n\nHomicide is correlated with other activities, such as corruption and extortion and compromised law enforcement, which harm commercial growth and entrepreneurship. Crime disproportionately constrains micro and small firms in Mexico, prompting them to defer growth plans and reduce working schedules or even close. Crime raises operating costs, notably for security personnel and transportation. In addition, research shows that homicides and thefts negatively affect foreign direct investment.\n\nDomestic investment, consumption momentum pace growth\n\nStrong private domestic investment and consumption accounted for the bulk of GDP growth in 2023, offsetting the weak external sector performance (Chart 7).\n\nDownloadable chart\n\nPrivate investment has trended higher as the pandemic recedes. The increase in private investment is partly due to investment catching up with suspended pandemic-era projects. Companies have taken advantage of the peso\u2019s buying power to replace outdated machinery and equipment. Finally, some of this domestic private investment is in preparation for nearshoring projects, according to anecdotal evidence.\n\nPrivate consumption has also grown steadily since the pandemic, fueled by a strong labor market and unprecedented real wage growth as well as record high remittances from the U.S.\n\nStrong labor market conditions in the U.S., wage growth and unprecedented pandemic-era fiscal stimulus explain the flow of real remittances from the U.S. At the micro level, remittances generally go to families in Mexico\u2019s poorest states in the central and the southwest regions. There, the payments smooth consumption and are mainly used for necessities such as food, clothing and health care.\n\nPublic investment is also growing after years of decline, notably major construction projects such as the Maya train in the Yucatan Peninsula and the Dos Bocas refinery in Tabasco. Still, the government\u2019s contribution to GDP growth is relatively small.\n\nNet exports were a negative contributor to real GDP growth in 2023, as bilateral surpluses with the U.S. and Canada were more than offset by deficits with Asia and Europe. China alone accounted for more than half of the deficit with Asia. The strong peso and falling oil exports also contributed to the negative balance.\n\nSlowing growth anticipated through year-end 2024\n\nThe Mexican economy is expected to continue slowing in 2024, with only moderate expansion in the U.S. dimming prospects. A beneficial slowing of inflation in Mexico may follow.\n\nIt is unclear if domestic investment, particularly construction investment, a major contributor to economic growth last year, can continue this year as major infrastructure projects are close to completion. Presidential elections in the U.S. and Mexico will likely add to uncertainty about future prospects.\n\nRemittances may have topped out, and U.S. economic slowing could diminish manufacturing exports. Indications of nearshoring acceleration are scant. Were it to materialize, such activity would provide growth potential in 2024 and in coming years.\n\nShare this",

        "text": "The Consequences of the US Supreme Court\u2019s Decision Upholding the CFPB\u2019s Funding Structure\nOn May 16, 2024, the US Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s (\u201cCFPB\u201d) funding structure in a decision that will have significant ramifications on both the CFPB\u2019s rulemaking and enforcement agenda in the near term and the future governance of the agency across administrations. In Consumer Financial Protection Bureau v. Community Financial Services Ass\u2019n of America, Ltd (\u201cCFSA\u201d), the Supreme Court reversed a 2022 decision by the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit that held that the funding structure of the agency violated the Appropriations Clause of the US Constitution.1 The Supreme Court\u2019s decision will likely spark an intensification in the CFPB\u2019s enforcement and rulemaking activities, as evidenced by CFPB Director Rohit Chopra\u2019s statement after the decision that the agency will now be \u201cfiring on all cylinders\u201d and will \u201cforge ahead with our law enforcement work.\u201d2 Over the long-term, the decision effectively ensures the president will have enhanced authority, at the expense of Congress, over the agency\u2019s agenda.\n\nBelow, we provide some background on the issues, summarize the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, and discuss its consequences for entities subject to the jurisdiction of the CFPB and for the agency itself.\n\nBackground\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision arises out of a challenge to the CFPB\u2019s payday lending rule, which was first issued by Director Richard Cordray in 2017.3 The district court rejected the various legal challenges raised by the plaintiffs but stayed the compliance date of the rule pending the resolution of the appeal. In 2022, the Fifth Circuit rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 challenges to the payday lending rule but instead ruled that the agency\u2019s funding structure violated the Appropriations Clause of the Constitution.4\n\nThe Constitution provides that \u201c[n]o money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.\u201d5 In accordance with the Appropriations Clause, agencies are typically funded through annual appropriations by Congress. In contrast, the CFPB is funded by yearly transfers from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System drawn from the Federal Reserve System\u2019s combined earnings in an amount the CFPB director determines is reasonably necessary to operate the agency up to a maximum of 12% of the Federal Reserve System\u2019s total operating expenses.6 By law, the House and Senate Appropriations Committees are prohibited from reviewing the funds the CFPB receives from the Federal Reserve.7 Because the Appropriations Clause grants Congress \u201cexclusive power over the federal purse,\u201d the Fifth Circuit found that the CFPB\u2019s funding mechanism violated the Appropriations Clause and the separation of powers principles which underpin it.8 The court further held that the CFPB had promulgated the payday lending rule using unconstitutionally appropriated funds and therefore vacated the rule.\n\nThe CFSA Decision\n\nIn CFSA, the Supreme Court reversed the Fifth Circuit\u2019s ruling and held in a 7-2 decision by Justice Clarence Thomas that the CFPB\u2019s funding structure satisfies the Appropriations Clause. In so holding, the Supreme Court concluded that an identified source and purpose are all that is required for a constitutionally valid \u201cappropriation.\u201d The Court found that the CFPB\u2019s funding mechanism satisfies those requirements because it identifies a specific source (the Federal Reserve) and purpose (carrying out the CFPB\u2019s duties and responsibilities). For additional information on the Court\u2019s decision, see our related alert.\n\nEffects of the Supreme Court\u2019s Decision on the CFPB\u2019s Enforcement and Rulemaking Activities\n\nPrior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, a number of courts had stayed active litigation over several CFPB proposed rules and enforcement actions pending the outcome of the appeal on grounds, in part, that the CFPB\u2019s funding mechanism was unconstitutional. The rules stayed include the CFPB\u2019s final rule limiting credit card late fees for certain large issuers to $8, the CFPB\u2019s changes to its UDAAP Exam Manual, and the CFPB\u2019s final rule on small business lending data collection under Section 1071 of the Dodd-Frank Act.9 Like the legal challenge to the payday lending rule, the legal challenges to these rules also were based on other grounds (including violations of the Administrative Procedure Act, which are unaffected by the decision in CFSA) and not solely the unconstitutionality of the CFPB\u2019s funding mechanism. These cases will now resume, and courts will need to consider these additional grounds as these cases move forward. Similarly, the stayed enforcement actions will begin to move forward, and pending information requests will likely require responses.\n\nWhile the Supreme Court\u2019s decision was pending, the CFPB announced a significant hiring initiative for enforcement attorneys, analysts, paralegals, e-litigation support specialists, economists, and more.10 Thus, providers of consumer financial products and services, secondary market participants, and other stakeholders should expect increased litigation, enforcement, and rulemaking activity from the CFPB throughout 2024 and beyond.11\n\nEnhanced Presidential Control Over CFPB\n\nThe impact of CSFA on the governance of the CFPB\u2014combined with the Supreme Court\u2019s earlier decision challenging the structure of the CFPB in Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2014will be greater presidential influence over the agency.\n\nGenerally, Congress and the president exercise joint control over most federal agencies through (i) the president\u2019s appointment and removal authority and (ii) the congressional appropriations process and Senate confirmation of nominees, respectively. In Seila Law, the Supreme Court struck down statutory restrictions on the president\u2019s authority to remove the director of the CFPB.12 The Court supported its decision on grounds that \u201c[w]ithout such power, the President could not be held fully accountable for discharging his own responsibilities; the buck would stop somewhere else.\u201d13 As a result, the CFPB director\u2014originally removable by the president only for \u201cinefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office\u201d\u2014is now removable by the president without cause.\n\nCongress\u2019s \u201cpower of the purse\u201d\u2014the ability to direct federal spending through the Appropriations Clause\u2014has been described as \u201cthe most important single curb in the Constitution on Presidential power.\u201d14 The Government Accountability Office further explains: \u201cAppropriations law is not only about ensuring that federal agencies follow a set of rules that Congress has enacted. These laws also help ensure that government carries out the will of, and remains accountable to, the American people.\u201d15 Although Congress can always pass new legislation, practically speaking, the existence of the filibuster in the Senate (which requires 60 votes for measures to be voted on) means that the annual \u201cmust-pass\u201d appropriations bills are the means through which Congress can actually exercise its authority over most federal agencies, including Cabinet agencies and independent agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n\nBecause the Court in CSFA upheld the CFPB\u2019s unusual funding arrangement outside the annual appropriations process, absent a statutory change that is unlikely due to the Senate filibuster rule, Congress lacks its principal means of oversight of the agency, particularly once a director is confirmed by the Senate. However, because the Court in Seila also protected the president\u2019s powers over the CFPB by upholding the president\u2019s constitutional authority to remove the CFPB director at will, the Court\u2019s decision in CSFA effectively means that the president, rather than Congress, will have the predominant role in determining the future direction of the CFPB, including, indirectly, its funding requests through the appointment and removal power. President Biden requested former CFPB Director Kathy Kraninger\u2019s resignation on the day of his inauguration, and we expect this precedent to continue with each change in administration. As a result, the direction of the CFPB will follow the results of presidential election returns rather than congressional elections. A Democratic-controlled Congress will have less leverage to influence the agency when Republicans hold the presidency and vice versa. From this perspective, CSFA merely continues the decades-long and bipartisan trend in American government toward the greater concentration of authority in the executive branch at the expense of Congress.\n\n1 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau v.

Innocuous, everyday, unremarkable to billions around the world. In India, these are also potentially the apps telling politicians everything they could possibly want to know about you - whether you want them to or not. A person's religion, mother tongue, \"the way you draft a message to your friend on social media\" have all become points of data politicians are keen to get their hands on, according to political strategist Rutwik Joshi, who is working with at least a dozen unnamed lawmakers on their re-election campaigns this election. And India\u2019s combination of high smartphone take-up and lax regulations allowing private companies to sell data mean that most political parties have gathered \"the data to do everything\" - even down to knowing \u201cwhat you are eating today\", he claims. The question is, why do they care? Put simply, says Mr Joshi, this level of information can predict the vote - \"and these predictions usually never go wrong\". But perhaps the bigger question is: why should you care? Microtargeting - described by Privacy International as the use of personal data \u201cto target you with information and adverts to an unprecedented degree of personalisation\u201d - is not new when it comes to elections. But it was in the wake of former US President Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 win that it really hit the headlines. Back then, political consultancy Cambridge Analytica was credited with helping him to victory using data sold by Facebook to profile people and send them pro-Trump content. The firm denied these allegations but suspended its CEO, Alexander Nix. In 2022, Meta agreed to pay $725m (\u00a3600m) to settle a class action lawsuit over a data breach linked to Cambridge Analytica.\n\nGetty Images Cambridge Analytica was credited with helping Trump to victory using data sold by Facebook\n\nIt left people questioning whether the adverts they had seen had swayed their votes. Countries around the world were concerned enough about the impact on democracy that they swung into action. In India, a Cambridge Analytica affiliate said the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the opposition Congress party were its clients - which both denied. The country's then IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad also warned of action against the company and Facebook if it misused data of Indian citizens. AI and deepfakes blur reality in India elections But there has since been little to stop micro-targeting of voters, data and security researcher Srinivas Kodali says. \"Every other election commission - like in the UK and Singapore - they all tried to understand the role of data and micro targeting in elections, they created certain forms of checks and balances, which is what normally an election commission should be doing, but we are not seeing that happen in India,\" he says. In India, the problem is compounded because it's \"a data society that was planned and built by the government without any safeguards\", Mr Kodali says. Indeed, there are some 650m smartphones users in the country - all boasting apps which could potentially share their data with a third party. But you don't necessarily need a smartphone to be vulnerable: one of the biggest holders of personal data is the government itself \u2013 and even it has been selling personal information to private companies. \u201cThe government built large databases of citizens, shared it with the private sector,\u201d Mr Kodali says. This has all left citizens vulnerable to increased surveillance with little control over what information remains private, warns Prateek Waghre, executive director at the digital rights organisation Internet Freedom Foundation.\n\nGetty Images India has built the world's largest biometric ID database - the Aadhaar scheme\n\nMeanwhile, a data protection law passed by the government last year is yet to be implemented, experts say. The lack of rules is an issue, says Mr Kodali. \"It's like the wild, wild west - except on the internet.\" And the result of all of this available data? As Mr Joshi puts it, India entered the election year as \"the biggest possible data mine in the world right now\". The thing is, no one is doing anything illegal, says Mr Joshi. \" I am not asking [the app], 'Give me mobile numbers of how many users you have and all the contact numbers of those users as well'. But I can ask, 'Are people eating veg or non-veg in your area?'\" he explains. And the apps are able to hand over that data \u2013 because the user gave them permission. \"For example, there are 10 different Indian apps in your mobile phone - you have given access to your contacts, to your gallery, to your mic, to your speakers, to your location, including the live location,\" Mr Joshi, whose company, Neeti I, has been using data to understand voter behaviour patterns in particular constituencies, says. And it is this data \u2013 along with data collected by party workers - which is then used to help decide who the candidate should be, where the candidate's wife should go to do a puja or aarti (offer prayers), what kind of speeches they should give - even what to wear. But does this level of targeting really work to change people\u2019s mind? That remains unclear.\n\nGetty Images Data collected helps strategists decide where candidates should go, what kind of speeches they should give - even what to wear\n\nBut campaigners say on a basic level, it is a violation of people\u2019s privacy. Extrapolating it further, having this level of detail could be used against people in the future. \"Just the fact that it is happening is problematic.\" says Pratik Waghre, executive director at the digital rights organisation Internet Freedom Foundation. \"What we've seen is that there often doesn't seem to be a clear distinction between how data is being handled when someone is beneficiary of a government scheme and how that information is then being used by that particular political party which happens to be in power in a particular state or at a national level to then use that to micro target people with campaign messages.\" The law also allows the government and government bodies to exempt themselves from vast sections on its discretion. It also has the powers to process, use or share this personal data with third parties. Mr Waghre fears future administrations could take it a step further. \"It can also be: \u2018Let's collectively see who's supporting us and only give them the benefits\u2019.\u201d\n\nGetty Images India\u2019s combination of high smartphone take up and lax regulations mean that most political parties have gathered \"the data to do everything\"",

A closer look, however, reveals that they are actually photographs of temporary sculptural re-creations.\n\nDemand often selects his source imagery from the news media, and he re-creates those images as life-size models using colored paper and cardboard. Then he photographs the images and prints them at a monumental scale.\n\nAfterward, Demand destroys his models, leaving behind only their ghostly photographic doubles. The \u201cstutter of history\u201d evoked by the exhibition\u2019s title lies in that strange gap between the real world and the re-created world of paper and cardboard that the artist conjures in his studio.\n\nThe internationally touring exhibition Thomas Demand: The Stutter of History is a landmark retrospective of the artist\u2019s work, and the MFAH is the only U.S. venue.\n\nBorn in Germany in 1964, Demand depicts places loaded with historical meaning: the abandoned control room of the Fukushima plant following the 2011 nuclear disaster; the site of the Florida recount of the 2000 American presidential election; the ransacked offices of the East German secret police after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Ultimately, Demand\u2019s works are as much about the circulation of images and the politics of memory as they are about the specific moments depicted.\n\n\u25ba Publication\n\nThe illustrated exhibition catalogue is available through the MFA Shop (713.639.7360) and the Museum\u2019s Hirsch Library (713.639.7325).\n\nThomas Demand: The Stutter of History / June 30\u2013September 15, 2024",

        "text": "South Africa elections 2024: ANC holds final rally in Soweto\nThe ANC hopes to conquer but will it struggle in South Africa poll?\n\nEPA\n\nUnder the banner Siyanqoba (Zulu for We Are Conquering), South Africa's governing African National Congress (ANC) held its final rally on Saturday as it campaigns for a record seventh term in office. But far from conquering, the party appears to be struggling in this election. Apart from its low-quality campaign posters and T-shirts, it failed to fill the 90,000-seater football stadium in the historic township of Soweto, where the rally was held. Opinion polls suggest that the ANC could lose its parliamentary majority for the first time since it was elected at the end of white-minority rule 30 years ago, as voters punish it for power cuts, widespread government corruption and crushingly high levels of unemployment. Nevertheless, the turn-out of 60,000 to 70,000 was still impressive, with Mr Ramaphosa declaring that the party was poised for a \"decisive victory\" in Wednesday's election.\n\nNomsa Maseko/BBC The ANC and its former leader Jacob Zuma are fighting it out in this election\n\nSome ANC supporters carried coffins of opposition parties - including that of former President Jacob Zuma's newly formed party, uMkhonto weSizwe (MK), which translates as Spear of the Nation. \"Zuma is a big traitor,\" Manelisi Zulu told the BBC. The 82-year-old former president caused a major shock in December by ditching the ANC to spearhead MK's campaign. Claiming that Mr Zuma's party had no future, Mr Zulu said: \"Today we are holding its memorial. On 29 May, we will bury it.\" Opinion polls paint a different picture, suggesting that MK could get between 8% and 13% of the national vote, and help deny the ANC a parliamentary majority. The party could also emerge as the largest in Mr Zuma's home province of KwaZulu-Natal, to end ANC control there. Aware of the threat, Mr Ramaphosa fired salvoes at his predecessor, without naming him. \"Those who could not stand the renewal of the ANC have left us,\" he said. Mr Ramaphosa added that money stolen through state capture - the term South Africans use to describe the grand corruption that took place during Mr Zuma's presidency - was being recovered by law-enforcement agencies, and that \"treasonous\" attempts to \"destroy\" the tax department had been \"stopped\". \"The people have told us that the ANC is their organisation. They have told us that they love the ANC. They have told us that they will not allow their organisation to be stolen by criminals and counter-revolutionaries,\" Mr Ramaphosa added. But the president himself was rocked by a major scandal in 2022, after it emerged that he had stashed at least $580,000 (\u00a3458,000) of cash in a sofa on his game farm, with the money later stolen by robbers. A panel of legal experts appointed by parliament recommended that impeachment proceedings be instituted against Mr Ramaphosa, but the ANC used its parliamentary majority to block it. Mr Ramaphosa denied any wrongdoing, while subsequent investigations - including by South Africa's public protector - cleared him. However, police are yet to disclose the outcome of their investigation. At the rally, ANC supporters dismissed the allegations of money-laundering against the president. \"It was a trap set up for Mr Ramaphosa so that he looks bad. He is the best president we've had,\" Thando Matidza told the BBC, as she applauded his pledge to root out corruption in the party.\n\nAFP President Cyril Ramaphosa is seeking a second term\n\nA survey published last month showed that corruption was the second-biggest concern for South Africans, after electricity blackouts which left homes and businesses without power for up to 12 hours a day. However, there have been no power-cuts for almost two months now, leading cynics to say that the ANC has miraculously kept the lights on during the campaign - and they'll be off again after the election. Mr Ramaphosa said that power stations were now being \"better maintained\", and the \"excellent work\" to tackle the energy crisis would be \"completed\" in the ANC's next term. Despite the many problems South Africa is facing - also including water shortages and deteriorating roads and railways - the ANC is almost certain to remain the largest party, even if it fails to pass the 50% threshold. Many voters still credit it for ending the racist system of apartheid and improving their lives by creating a welfare state and providing housing, although homelessness remains a huge issue. South Africa in eight charts ahead of crucial vote\n\nDesperate search for jobs overshadows election\n\nCynthia voted for Nelson Mandela. Now she's abandoning his successors Unable to match the ANC's support, the main opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) is due to hold its final campaign rally at a 20,000-seater stadium later on Sunday. An Ipsos opinion poll released last month gave it only around 22% of the vote, while the Social Research Foundation's tracking poll put its support earlier this month at between 24% and 27%. The ANC's chances of remaining the biggest party have been bolstered by the fact that the opposition is heavily divided. A total of 51 opposition parties are on the national ballot, competing for seats in parliament. But the DA has also been hit by splits. Two of its senior black leaders - Mmusi Maimane and Herman Mashaba - quit the party after the 2019 election, and have formed their own parties to contest Wednesday's election. Mr Ramphosa blasted the DA at his final campaign rally. Without naming it, he described the party's pledge to phase out the national minimum wage as \"outrageous\", especially \"in these times of hardship\". \"These are the same reactionary forces that see nothing wrong in paying slave wages to illegal migrants while depriving law-abiding workers of the right to a living wage,\" Mr Ramaphosa added. The DA's support comes mainly from racial minorities - including Muslims in the coloured, as mixed-race South Africans are known, and Asian communities. Muslims make up less than 2% of the population, but as each vote matters, the ANC is hoping they will vote for the party because of the strong support it has shown for Palestinians, taking Israel to the International Court of Justice on charges of genocide, which Israel denies.\n\nEPA The ANC has been a long-standing supporter of the Palestinians\n\nAt the rally, Mr Ramaphosa chanted the controversial slogan, \"Free Free Palestine. From the river to the sea, Palestine shall be free.\" \"There must an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. The hostages held in Gaza must be released. The people of Gaza must receive all the food, fuel and other essential goods they need to prevent mass starvation,\" he said. ANC member Salome Makgoba welcomed Mr Ramaphosa's support for the Palestinians, telling the BBC: \"When we were under apartheid, Palestinians supported us. It is our turn to return the favour.\" The conflict has clearly been a major mobilising tool for the ANC, but it is unlikely to determine the outcome of the election as people are more worried about domestic issues - and will give their verdict on Wednesday on who is best-placed to take South Africa forward.\n\nGetty Images/BBC",

On the other hand, there's a line, where it could become irrelevant and prejudicial.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s defence team twice called for a mistrial during Ms Daniels\u2019 testimony, motions that were denied by the judge.\n\nBeyond that, the novel legal strategy taken by the District Attorney in this case may also provide grounds for appeal.\n\nFalsifying business records can be a lower-level misdemeanour in New York, but Trump faced more serious felony charges because of a supposed second crime, an alleged illegal attempt to influence the 2016 election.\n\nProsecutors broadly alleged that violations of federal and state election laws, along with tax fraud, applied to this case. But they did not specify to the jury exactly which one was broken.\n\nLegal experts say there are questions around the scope and application of the federal law that could form a basis for appeal. Never before has a state prosecutor invoked an uncharged federal crime, and there\u2019s a question if the Manhattan District Attorney had the jurisdiction to do so.",

        "text": "Undergraduate Commencement Address by Ken Burns\nUndergraduate Commencement Address by Ken Burns\n\nDescriptive Transcript\n\nSCENE: Ken Burns, in a black academic robe with a white hood, speaks at a podium in front of a large blue banner with Brandeis University and the university logo. Also on the stage are other faculty members and distinguished guests wearing academic robes.\n\nKEN BURNS SPEAKING:\n\nBrandeisian, love it.\n\nPresident Liebowitz, Ron, Chair Lisa Kranc, and other members of the board of trustees, Provost Carol Fierke, fellow honorees, distinguished faculty and staff, proud and relieved parents, calm and serene grandparents, distracted but secretly pleased siblings, ladies and gentlemen, graduating students of the class of 2024, good morning.\n\nI am deeply honored and privileged that you have asked me here to say a few words at such a momentous occasion that you might find what I have to say worthy of your attention on so important a day in all of your lives. Thank you for this honor.\n\nListen, I am in the business of history. It is not always a happy subject on college campuses these days, particularly when forces seem determined to eliminate or water down difficult parts of our past, particularly when the subject may seem to sum an anachronistic and irrelevant pursuit, and particularly with the ferocious urgency this moment seems to exert on us. It is my job, however, to remind people of the power our past also exerts, to help us better understand what's going on now with compelling story, memory, and anecdote. It is my job to try to discern patterns and themes from history to enable us to interpret our dizzying and sometimes dismaying present.\n\nFor nearly 50 years now, I have diligently practiced and rigorously tried to maintain a conscious neutrality in my work, avoiding advocacy if I could, trying to speak to all of my fellow citizens. Over those many decades I've come to understand a significant fact, that we are not condemned to repeat, as the saying goes, what we don't remember. That is a beautiful, even poetic phrase, but not true. Nor are there cycles of history as the academic community periodically promotes. The Old Testament, Ecclesiastes to be specific, got it right, I think. What has been will be again, what has been done will be done again. There is nothing new under the sun. What those lines suggest is that human nature never changes or almost never changes. We continually superimpose that complex and contradictory human nature over the seemingly random chaos of events, all of our inherent strengths and weaknesses, our greed and generosity, our puritanism and our prurience, our virtue, and our venality parade before our eyes, generation after generation after generation. This often gives us the impression that history repeats itself. It does not. \"No event has ever happened twice, it just rhymes,\" Mark Twain is supposed to have said. I have spent all of my professional life on the lookout for those rhymes, drawn inexorably to that power of history. I am interested in listening to the many varied voices of a true, honest, complicated past that is unafraid of controversy and tragedy, but equally drawn to those stories and moments that suggest an abiding faith in the human spirit, and particularly the unique role this remarkable and sometimes also dysfunctional republic seems to play in the positive progress of mankind.\n\nDuring the course of my work, I have become acquainted with hundreds if not thousands of those voices. They have inspired, haunted, and followed me over the years. Some of them may be helpful to you as you try to imagine and make sense of the trajectory of your lives today.\n\nListen, listen. In January of 1838, shortly before his 29th birthday, a tall, thin lawyer prone to bouts of debilitating depression addressed the young men's lyceum in Springfield, Illinois. \"At what point shall we expect the approach of danger?\" He asked his audience, \"Shall we expect some trans-Atlantic military giant to step the earth and crush us at a blow?\" Then he answered his own question. \"Never. All the armies of Europe, Asia, and Africa could not by force take a drink from the Ohio River or make a track on the Blue Ridge in a trial of a thousand years. If destruction be our lot, we must ourselves be its author and finisher. As a nation of free men, we must live through all time or die by suicide.\" It is a stunning, remarkable statement, one that has animated my own understanding of the American experience since I first read it more than 40 years ago. That young man was of course Abraham Lincoln, and he would go on to preside over the closest this country has ever come to near national suicide, our civil war, and yet embedded in his extraordinary, disturbing, and prescient words is also a fundamental optimism that implicitly acknowledges the geographical forcefield two mighty oceans east and west and two relatively benign neighbors north and south have provided for us since the British burned the White House in the War of 1812 and inspired Francis Scott Key.\n\nLincoln's words that day suggest what is so great and so good about the people who happen to inhabit this lucky and exquisite country of ours. That's the world you now inherit: our work ethic and our restlessness, our innovation and our improvisation, our communities and our institutions of higher learning, our suspicion of power. The fact that we seem resolutely dedicated to parsing the meaning between individual and collective freedom; What I want versus what we need. That we are all so dedicated to understanding what Thomas Jefferson really meant when he wrote that mysterious phrase, \"The pursuit of happiness\". Hint, it happens right here in the lifelong learning and perpetual improvement this university is committed to.\n\nBut the isolation of those two oceans has also helped to incubate habits and patterns less beneficial to us: our devotion to money and guns and conspiracies, our certainty about everything, our stubborn insistence on our own exceptionalism blinding us to that which needs repair, especially with regard to race and ethnicity. Our preoccupation with always making the other wrong at an individual as well as a global level. I am reminded of what the journalist I.F. Stone once said to a young acolyte who was profoundly disappointed in his mentor's admiration for Thomas Jefferson. \"It's because history is tragedy,\" Stone admonished him, \"Not melodrama.\" It's the perfect response. In melodrama all villains are perfectly villainous and all heroes are perfectly virtuous, but life is not like that. You know that in your guts and nor is our history like that. The novelist, Richard Powers recently wrote that, \"The best arguments in the world,\" \u2014 and ladies and gentlemen, that's all we do is argue \u2014 \"the best arguments in the world,\" he said, \"Won't change a single person's point of view. The only thing that can do that is a good story.\" I've been struggling for most of my life to do that, to try to tell good, complex, sometimes contradictory stories, appreciating nuance and subtlety and undertow, sharing the confusion and consternation of unreconciled opposites.\n\nBut it's clear as individuals and as a nation we are dialectically preoccupied. Everything is either right or wrong, red state or blue state, young or old, gay or straight, rich or poor, Palestinian or Israeli, my way or the highway. Everywhere we are trapped by these old, tired, binary reactions, assumptions, and certainties. For filmmakers and faculty, students and citizens, that preoccupation is imprisoning. Still, we know and we hear and we express only arguments, and by so doing, we forget the inconvenient complexities of history and of human nature. That, for example, three great religions, their believers, all children of Abraham, each professing at the heart of their teaching, a respect for all human life, each with a central connection to and legitimate claim to the same holy ground, violate their own dictates of conduct and make this perpetually contested land a shameful graveyard. God does not distinguish between the dead. \"Could you?\"\n\n[Audience applauding]\n\n\"Could you?\" A very wise person I know with years of experience with the Middle East recently challenged me, \"Could you hold the idea that there could be two wrongs and two rights?\"\n\nListen, listen. In a filmed interview I conducted with the writer James Baldwin, more than 40 years ago, he said, \"No one was ever born who agreed to be a slave, who accepted it. That is, slavery is a condition imposed from without. Of course, the moment I say that,\" Baldwin continued, \"I realize that multitudes and multitudes of people for various reasons of their own enslave themselves every hour of every day to this or that doctrine, this or that delusion of safety, this or that lie. Anti-Semites, for example,\" he went on, \"are slaves to a delusion. People who hate Negroes are slaves. People who love money are slaves. We are living in a universe really of willing slaves, which makes the concept of liberty and the concept of freedom so dangerous,\" he finished. Baldwin is making a profoundly psychological and even spiritual statement, not just a political or racial or social one. He knew, just as Lincoln knew, that the enemy is often us. We continue to shackle ourselves with chains we mistakenly think is freedom.\n\nAnother voice, Mercy Otis Warren, a philosopher and historian during our revolution put it this way, \"The study of the human character at once opens a beautiful and a deformed picture of the soul. We there find a noble principle implanted in the nature of people, but when the checks of conscience are thrown aside, humanity is obscured.\" I have had the privilege for nearly half a century of making films about the US, but I have also made films about us. That is to say the two letter, lowercase, plural pronoun. All of the intimacy of \"us\" and also \"we\" and \"our\" and all of the majesty, complexity, contradiction, and even controversy of the US. And if I have learned anything over those years, it's that there's only us. There is no them. And whenever someone suggests to you, whomever it may be in your life that there's a them, run away. Othering is the simplistic binary way to make and identify enemies, but it is also the surest way to your own self imprisonment, which brings me to a moment I've dreaded and forces me to suspend my longstanding attempt at neutrality.\n\nThere is no real choice this November. There is only the perpetuation, however flawed and feeble you might perceive it, of our fragile 249-year-old experiment or the entropy that will engulf and destroy us if we take the other route. When, as Mercy Otis Warren would say, \"The checks of conscience are thrown aside and a deformed picture of the soul is revealed.\" The presumptive Republican nominee is the opioid of all opioids, an easy cure for what some believe is the solution to our myriad pains and problems. When in fact with him, you end up re-enslaved with an even bigger problem, a worse affliction and addiction, \"a bigger delusion\", James Baldwin would say, the author and finisher of our national existence, our national suicide as Mr. Lincoln prophesies. Do not be seduced by easy equalization. There is nothing equal about this equation. We are at an existential crossroads in our political and civic lives. This is a choice that could not be clearer.\n\n[Audience applauding]\n\nListen, listen. 33 years ago, the world lost a towering literary figure. The novelist and storyteller, not arguer, Isaac Bashevis Singer. For decades he wrote about God and myth and punishment, fate and sexuality, family and history. He wrote in Yiddish a marvelously expressive language, sad and happy all at the same time. Sometimes maddeningly all knowing, yet resigned to God's seemingly capricious will. It is also a language without a country, a dying language in a world more interested in the extermination or isolation of its long suffering speakers. Singer, writing in the pages of the Jewish Daily Forward help to keep Yiddish alive. Now our own wonderfully mongrel American language is punctuated with dozens of Yiddish words and phrases, parables and wise sayings, and so many of those words are perfect onomatopoeias of disgust and despair, hubris and humor. If you've ever met a schmuck, you know what I'm talking about. [audience laughs] Toward the end of his long and prolific life, Singer expressed wonder at why so many of his books written in this obscure and some said useless language would be so widely translated, something like 56 countries all around the world. \"Why,\" he would wonder with his characteristic playfulness, \"Why would the Japanese care about his simple stories of life in the shtetls of Eastern Europe 1,000 years ago?\" \"Unless,\" Singer paused, twinkle in his eye, \"Unless the story spoke of the kinship of the soul.\" I think what Singer was talking about was that indefinable something that connects all of us together, that which we all share as part of organic life on this planet, the kinship of the soul. I love that.\n\nOkay, let me speak directly to the graduating class. Watch out, here comes the advice. Listen. Be curious, not cool. Insecurity makes liars of us all. Remember, none of us get out of here alive. The inevitable vicissitudes of life, no matter how well gated our communities, will visit us all. Grief is a part of life, and if you explore its painful precincts, it will make you stronger. Do good things, help others. Leadership is humility and generosity squared. Remember the opposite of faith is not doubt. Doubt is central to faith. The opposite of faith is certainty. The kinship of the soul begins with your own at times withering self-examination. Try to change that unchangeable human nature of Ecclesiastes, but start with you. \"Nothing so needs reforming,\" Mark Twain once chided us, \"As other people's habits.\" [audience laughs]\n\nDon't confuse success with excellence. Do not descend too deeply into specialism. Educate all of your parts, you will be healthier. Do not get stuck in one place. \"Travel is fatal to prejudice,\" Twain also said. Be in nature, which is always perfect and where nothing is binary. Its sheer majesty may remind you of your own atomic insignificance, as one observer put it, but in the inscrutable and paradoxical ways of wild places, you will feel larger, inspirited, just as the egotist in our midst is diminished by his or her self regard.\n\nAt some point, make babies, one of the greatest things that will happen to you, I mean it, one of the greatest things that will happen to you is that you will have to worry, I mean really worry, about someone other than yourself. It is liberating and exhilarating, I promise. Ask your parents.\n\n[Audience laughs]\n\nChoose honor over hypocrisy, virtue over vulgarity, discipline over dissipation, character over cleverness, sacrifice over self-indulgence. Do not lose your enthusiasm, in its Greek etymology the word enthusiasm means simply, \"god in us\". Serve your country. Insist that we fight the right wars. Denounce oppression everywhere.\n\n[Audience applauding]\n\nConvince your government, as Lincoln understood that the real threat always and still comes from within this favored land. Insist that we support science and the arts, especially the arts.\n\n[Audience cheering]\n\nThey have nothing to do with the actual defense of our country; They just make our country worth defending.\n\n[Audience applauding]\n\nRemember what Louis Brandeis said, \"The most important political office is that of the private citizen.\" Vote. You indelibly... [audience applauding] Please, vote. You indelibly underscore your citizenship, and most important, our kinship with each other when you do. Good luck and godspeed.\n\n[Audience applauding]",

        "text": "Trump, RFK Jr. face hostile reception at Libertarian convention amid efforts to sway voters\nWashington \u2014 Former President Donald Trump and independent presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr.'s attempts to appeal to the Libertarian Party fell on deaf ears this weekend, with the third-party crowd interrupting and mocking both at the party's convention in Washington, D.C.\n\nA chaotic scene unfolded as Trump took the stage Saturday, as Libertarians clashed with pro-Trump attendees throughout his speech, resulting in multiple people being removed from the room and the crowd split between jeers, boos and chants directed at Trump.\n\n\"You can either nominate us and give us the position or give us your votes,\" Trump said to boos as he departed the stage.\n\nTrump repeatedly snapped back at the crowd and their hostility, telling them at one point to \"keep getting your 3% [of the national vote] every four years,\" adding, \"maybe you don't want to win.\"\n\nPeople hold up signs reading \"Free Ross\" as former President Donald Trump arrives to address the Libertarian National Convention in Washington, D.C, on May 25, 2024. JIM WATSON/AFP via Getty Images\n\nJo Jorgensen, the Libertarian Party's nominee in 2020, got 1.85 million votes, under 1.2% of the popular vote. And in 2016, Gary Johnson, the party's nominee that cycle, received 4.48 million votes, about 3.3% of the popular vote. While the party tends to win small percentages of the vote, in states where President Joe Biden and Trump are separated by tens of thousands of votes, support for third-party candidates could mean the difference between winning and losing the election.\n\nIn his pitch to Libertarian voters, Trump called for the commutation of Ross Ulbricht's life sentence. Ulbricht, the founder of the Silk Road website, was found guilty of multiple felonies tied to the black market site. Silk Road allowed users to buy and sell products anonymously, including drugs and fake government documents. The Libertarian Party has made freeing Ulbricht a part of its platform.\n\nSecurity personnel grab a Libertarian party member shouting protests as former President Donald Trump addresses the Libertarian National Convention in Washington, D.C., on May 25, 2024. JIM WATSON/AFP via Getty Images\n\nHowever, during his 2024 reelection campaign announcement two years ago, Trump called on Congress to pass a law mandating the death penalty for drug dealers.\n\nOn Friday, Kennedy \u2014 who received a warmer reception than Trump \u2014 tried to win Libertarians over to his camp by promising to pardon government whistleblower Edward Snowden, currently exiled in Russia, and to drop espionage charges against Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder battling U.S. attempts to extradite him from Britain \u2014 two figures revered by Libertarians. He also criticized Trump several times for his handling of the pandemic, claiming that Trump violated the Constitution by allowing lockdowns and travel restrictions.\n\nKennedy's remarks on Snowden and Assange drew cheers. While his audience comprised many former Democrats and Republicans, some Libertarians felt he wasn't a true candidate for their party.\n\nThe decision by Libertarian Party leadership to host Trump and Kennedy divided the party and prompted aggressive reactions from some delegates who sought to exclude both candidates from the event.\n\nIndependent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. speaks at the Libertarian National Convention on May 24, 2024, in Washington, D.C. Getty Images\n\nWhile Trump was not vying for the Libertarian nomination, he was hoping to win over some uncommitted Libertarian voters.\n\nConvention organizers also invited President Biden, but he declined to deliver remarks.\n\nLibertarian Party leaders said they chose to invite the candidates as a way for members to speak directly to those who might win the White House in November.\n\n\"We are denied a place on the debate stage, so we decided to make our own stage the focal point of the world's eyes,\" said Brian McWilliams, Libertarian National Party communications director.\n\nDuring a business session Friday, several delegates were heard yelling profanities at the Libertarian Party chair, Angela McArdle, in objection to Trump and Kennedy taking the stage at the convention.\n\nSeveral booed and yelled obscenities at McArdle as she attempted to calm the crowd. Security later escorted one man out of the session.\n\nArielle Shack, a Libertarian voter at the convention Friday, told CBS News she was attending Kennedy's speech in protest, which took place at the same time as the rowdy business session.\n\nShack said she traveled to the convention from New Jersey to represent other New Jersey Libertarian voters who felt Kennedy and Trump should not have been invited because they were not true Libertarians.\n\n\"We don't want people that are not Libertarians here. If they don't have our principles, we're not going to vote for them,\" Shack said. \"You're not gonna see Libertarians coming in, voting for a Kennedy, a Kennedy Democrat. He didn't get the Democratic [candidacy], so now he wants to be independent. But I think we can see right through that.\"\n\nAnother Libertarian voter, Richard Edgar from New Jersey, said he felt the invitation of both Trump and Kennedy was a \"slap in the face\" to Libertarian voters, who were expecting to hear Libertarian candidates make their case.\n\nMichael Reeves \u2014 a Libertarian delegate from Daphne, Alabama who said he had been a member of the party for about 25 years \u2014 said that Trump and Kennedy's attendance at the convention \"speaks well for the influence that we could exert on an election at this point, that they feel like they need to cater to us in any way.\"\n\nReeves said he would likely vote for the Libertarian nominee after sitting out in 2020. Reeves said that Kennedy's speech was \"not bold enough,\" and he was \"disappointed\" by Trump's first term in the White House.\n\n\"I thought he had an opportunity to really make some changes in D.C., and he didn't,\" Reeves said about Trump. \"The best we can say is that he didn't start any new wars, and that's a pretty low bar.\"\n\nHe added that both Democrats and Republicans are moving the country towards a \"more collectivist and authoritarian state.\"\n\n\"To me, they represent essentially the same thing, the things that they disagree about are kind of minor compared to the things that they do agree about,\" Reeves said. \"And they make all the wrong calls on the things that they do agree about.\"",

        "text": "Why Congress Should Pay Attention to Mexico\u2019s Presidential Election\nThis piece was originally published here by The National Interest.\n\nWhen you mention the 2024 election, most people think of the U.S. presidential election in November. Still, there is another earlier election that will have far-reaching consequences for all Americans as well. On Sunday, June 2, 2024, Mexico will go to the polls to elect a new president. According to the polls, former Mexico City mayor Claudia Sheinbaum is leading her closest rival, X\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez, by double digits.\n\nSheinbaum is known as a leftist nationalist who is committed to continuing the policy platform of current president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (AMLO). G\u00e1lvez has promised to reject those nationalistic attitudes and policies and adopt a more business-friendly and collaborative relationship with the United States.\n\nHere are seven numerical reasons why Congress should pay attention to the Mexican election:\n\n249,735: In December of 2023, almost a quarter of a million migrants were either apprehended or expelled at the United States\u2019 Southwest border. According to the Pew Research Center, that \u201cwas the highest monthly total on record, easily eclipsing the previous peak of about 224,000 encounters in May 2022.\u201d The outgoing president, Lopez Obrador, initially worked closely with the U.S. government on this shared goal of reducing illegal immigration, but in recent years, he has scaled back cooperation. The next Mexican president will have to decide whether to renew and re-energize bilateral U.S. cooperation, especially within the realm of controlling the flow of migrants coming through Mexico en route to the southern U.S. border.\n\n280,000 is the number of foreign nationals deported from Mexico in March 2024. Due to pressure from the U.S. government, President Lopez Obrador has once again begun helping stem the flow of migrants across its territory after drastically reducing those efforts in 2023. Will the next president allocate the funding needed to stop migrants within Mexican territory?\n\n107,543 drug overdoses occurred in the United States in 2023, according to the CDC. Mexico is a critically important partner in fighting the drug trade, but in recent years, the Mexican government has taken a lighter hand when it comes to tackling drug-trafficking organizations (DTOs). President Lopez Obrador has adopted a \u201chugs, not bullets\u201d strategy in dealing with organized crime and has repeatedly denied Mexican involvement in manufacturing fentanyl, the most lethal drug currently crossing the border. If the next president continues this policy of inaction, the synthetic drug problem in the United States will only worsen, with catastrophic consequences for public health.\n\n$63.3 billion is the dollar amount of remittances sent to Mexico in 2023, almost all of which came from the United States. This number has grown from $36 billion before the pandemic. In large part, this flow of dollars to the Mexican economy has helped sustain domestic demand and has compensated for a lack of growth. If the next president can stimulate the Mexican economy, these remittances will become much less important.\n\n$44.2 billion is the dollar value of refined petroleum products exported by the United States to Mexico in 2022. Mexico has become the United States\u2019 largest export market for gasoline and other refined products, and this sum has grown four-fold in the past decade. President Obrador has overseen a rapid deterioration in Mexico\u2019s oil sector but has committed himself to a very ambitious and expensive goal of producing more refined products at home. If successful, this \u201cenergy sovereignty\u201d policy will directly impact U.S. exports. Of the two leading candidates, Sheinbaum is committed to continuing President Obrador\u2019s approach. Galvez supports a free-market model of modernization and liberalization of the sector.\n\n5.7 billion is the volume in cubic feet of natural gas exported to Mexico from the United States every day. Mexico\u2019s industrialization and growing need for power generation will see this number grow even further in the years ahead if the next president pursues the right economic policies. However, a number of economic nationalist voices in the Mexican government have warned of potential over-dependence on U.S.-provided gas, which they believe could pose a threat to Mexico\u2019s sovereignty\u2014a fear that could affect the continued strength and viability of the energy trade.\n\n1: Mexico is the largest trading partner for the United States. In 2023, for the first time, Mexico traded more goods with the United States than any other country, surpassing China and Canada\u2014who, for years, had held the top spot. Total trade between the two countries amounted to $799 billion in 2023. That is $2.2 billion a day, over $91 million an hour, and over $1.5 million a minute. The deepening of ties between the United States and Mexican economies has reached the point where they are an essential element in maintaining U.S. competitiveness. Perhaps this reason, above all the others, is the most compelling reason to pay attention to Mexico\u2019s June election.\n\nThe choice facing the Mexican people in June is one of continuity or change. Continuity means that cooperation between the United States and Mexico on issues of security, migration, and narco-trafficking will remain difficult and limited. This election is critical for the well-being of citizens and the economies on both sides of the border. Good governance in Mexico, paired with solid cooperation between the new Mexican government and the United States, will be essential in promoting the welfare of both nations.",

        "text": "Democrats unveil plan to get Biden on Ohio general election ballot\nDemocrats unveil plan to get Biden on Ohio ballot\n\nA partisan clash threatened to keep the US president off the general election ballot in Ohio\n\nThe national Democratic party will now virtually nominate Mr Biden ahead of the convention.\n\nBut Republican officials in Ohio have escalated a standoff over the convention's dates and state ballot access laws.\n\nJoe Biden will formally accept his party's presidential nomination for 2024 at its national convention this August.\n\nDemocrats have announced a solution to break the partisan impasse threatening to keep the sitting US president off the general election ballot in Ohio.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden will be on the ballot in Ohio and all 50 states, and Ohio Republicans agree,\u201d Democratic National Committee chairman Jaime Harrison said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cBut when the time has come for action, they have failed to act every time, so Democrats will land this plane on our own.\"\n\nHeld in a presidential election year, party conventions take place during the summer over three days of pomp and pageantry.\n\nA party convention typically culminates with an in-person roll call of every US state and territory nominating their choice of candidate, which is determined by how many votes the individual earned in a preceding primary contest.\n\nThe candidate is formally certified as the party nominee on the final day.\n\nIn 2020, the Democratic and Republican conventions were largely virtual affairs because of Covid-19 restrictions on social gatherings.\n\nEach party had planned to return to a more extravagant format this year.\n\nRepublicans will gather in Milwaukee, Wisconsin from 15 to 18 July to re-nominate former President Donald Trump, while Democrats will meet in Chicago, Illinois from 19 to 22 August to select Mr Biden again.\n\nThe party that holds the White House - in this case the Democrats - typically holds its convention after the opposing party's event, but Ohio's Republican elections chief had warned in April that the DNC event falls foul of state election laws.\n\nOhio requires political parties to officially confirm their presidential and vice-presidential nominees to the elections chief 90 or more days before the early November general election.\n\nIn a letter earlier this month to state Democrats, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose said he was \"duty-bound to instruct boards of elections to begin preparing ballots\" that did not include the names of Mr Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris.\n\nSuch conflicts have been resolved with little drama in the past, with Ohio itself making exceptions for Mr Trump in 2020 and Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee.\n\nThis year, Democrats in Washington state and Republicans in Alabama made the provisional changes necessary to exempt Mr Biden from ballot deadlines.\n\nBut Republicans in the Ohio state legislature expressed opposition to such a solution this year, with the House Speaker quoted as saying \"there's just not the will do that\".\n\nLawmakers were called into a special legislative session at the state capitol on Tuesday by Governor Mike DeWine, a moderate Republican who has urged an end to the \"absurd situation\".\n\nBut as the session began, doubts remained over whether the body would implement its own fix, and Democrats told US media they were taking matters into their own hands.\n\n\"Through a virtual roll call, we will ensure that Republicans can\u2019t chip away at our democracy through incompetence or partisan tricks and that Ohioans can exercise their right to vote for the presidential candidate of their choice,\" Mr Harrison said in his Tuesday statement.\n\nIt remains unclear when the roll call will take place and whether it will involve every single state and territory.\n\nOhio, once viewed as a swing state, has become increasingly conservative.\n\nMr Trump won Ohio in both 2016 and 2020, defeating Hillary Clinton and Mr Biden by roughly 8% margins on each occasion.\n\nThe fight over Ohio's ballot comes after another partisan clash earlier this year - one that threatened Mr Trump's ballot appearance.\n\nOfficials in Colorado, Illinois and Maine ruled that the Republican was barred from returning to the White House under a Civil War-era insurrection clause in the US Constitution.\n\nThe US Supreme Court ultimately knocked down that decision in March, ruling that Mr Trump must be placed on the three states' presidential ballots.",

        "text": "NATO allies brace for possible Trump 2024 victory\nHow NATO is preparing for a possible second Trump presidency\n\nLondon \u2014 With six months to go until the presidential election, America's NATO allies are planning to boost their defense spending ahead of the potential disruption of a second Donald Trump presidency.\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg is preparing a funding plan to try to insulate the 75-year-old military partnership from any changing political realities that might affect the alliance, according to Oana Lungescu, who until last year was the longtime lead NATO spokesperson for Stoltenberg.\n\n\"It is important to have predictability both for allies and for Ukraine,\" Lungescu told CBS News. \"This [plan] relieves the U.S. of some of its organizational burden while still maintaining full oversight,\" she said.\n\nStoltenberg has proposed a $107 billion, five-year package of military aid for Ukraine that would give the broader alliance a more direct role in funding, Reuters reported last month.\n\nFILE: President Donald Trump, center left, shakes hands with Emmanuel Macron, France's president, as other world leaders look on during NATO summit in Brussels, on Thursday, May 25, 2017. Jasper Juinen/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nUnder the plan, European allies would create a shared Ukraine aid fund and increase their contributions to Kyiv's war effort, reducing the sizable funding provided by the U.S.\n\nTrump's first term as president demonstrated that the 2024 presumptive Republican nominee is unafraid to upend the NATO alliance. Trump shocked America's allies with his open criticism of the failure of some NATO members to meet defense funding commitments, and the Trump campaign has said that calling on allies to increase their defense spending is a policy that a future Trump White House would aggressively pursue.\n\nIn an emailed statement, Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that \"President Trump got our allies to increase their NATO spending by demanding they pay up, but Crooked Joe Biden went back to letting them take advantage of the American taxpayer.\"\n\n\"When President Trump returns to the Oval Office, he will restore peace and rebuild American strength and deterrence on the world stage,\" Leavitt said.\n\nLungescu said that the strategy proposed by Stoltenberg would address Trump's complaint that NATO allies aren't doing enough to share the economic burden. At the same time, Stoltenberg is trying to protect Ukraine from the kind of severe delays in Congress \u2014 mostly driven by House Republicans \u2014 that halted U.S. aid and weapons funding for the first half of the year. NATO allies are also increasing their own individual defense spending, Lungescu told CBS News, although she also pointed out that American presidents dating back to Eisenhower have criticized NATO partners for not contributing enough.\n\nNATO guidelines say member states should commit a minimum of 2% of their Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to defense spending to continue to ensure the Alliance's military readiness.\n\nBy NATO's own admission, in terms of GDP, the wealth of its members \"nearly equals that of the U.S.\" But \"non-U.S. Allies together spend less than half of what the United States spends on defense,\" according to NATO's website.\n\nAs of 2023, only 10 of the 30 other NATO allies had met the 2% spending commitment, excluding the U.S., though two-thirds of the NATO allies are expected to meet the target by the end of the year.\n\n\"I think by the time we get to the Washington NATO summit in July, we will have updated figures and will be in an even better position in terms of significantly increased defense spending,\" Lungescu predicted.\n\nTrump vows to not protect NATO allies who don't raise their spending\n\nIn February, former President Trump said at a campaign rally in South Carolina that he'd encourage Russia to \"do whatever the hell they want\" to NATO allies who don't pay their fair share into the Western military alliance.\n\nReferring to a conversation with an unnamed leader of an NATO country who asked him, \"If we don't pay, are you still going to protect us,\" Trump said he replied, \"Absolutely not.\"\n\nSince Trump left office in Jan. 2021, his former national security adviser, John Bolton, has said the former president had been close to withdrawing the U.S.from NATO at the end of a 2018 summit and said another Trump term presents an existential threat to the trans-Atlantic alliance.\n\n\"Many [NATO] countries owe us a tremendous amount of money\u2026 The United States has paid and stepped up like nobody,\" Trump said at a July 2018 NATO gathering, adding that \"something has to be done.\"\n\nWill Trump withdraw U.S. from NATO?\n\n\"I think Trump will cause significant damage in a second term, damage that in some cases will be irreparable,\" Bolton wrote in his 2020 memoir, \"The Room Where It Happened.\" He said he believes Trump intends to pull America out of the alliance if reelected.\n\n\"I think he fully intends to do that,\" Bolton wrote. \"I think that would be a catastrophic decision for America and a whole host of other things. It's a very grim prospect to see Trump in for a second term.\"\n\n\"I think that actually the biggest danger he [Trump] is for NATO is his unpredictability,\" Ben Hodges, a former commanding general of the U.S. Army in Europe, told CBS News. \"The urgency of defense investment is even greater if Trump turns out to be not as dependable as every other American president has been.\"\n\nHodges said that a way to ensure that NATO allies maintain smooth diplomatic relations with any incoming Trump administration would be for America's allies to honor their commitments and increase their defense spending now.\n\nBut he's skeptical that Mr. Trump would move to withdraw the U.S. from NATO, pointing to a law passed in Congress last year that prohibits the president from withdrawing from NATO or using any appropriated funds for that purpose without approval from lawmakers.\n\nWar game simulates NATO collapse in a second Trump term\n\nA recent war game run by Finley Grimble, a former intelligence analyst for the U.K. Ministry of Defense, found that in the event of a second Trump presidency, the alliance would be vulnerable to collapse, even if the U.S. doesn't withdraw from NATO.\n\nGrimble's war game ran a scenario in which Trump wins the election. The new administration immediately attempts to unilaterally broker a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia. The talks break down and Trump then slashes foreign aid to Ukraine.\n\nIn the absence of having the congressional majority needed to formally withdraw the U.S. from the NATO treaty, the Trump White House then significantly reduces U.S. participation in NATO exercises, including moving 50% of America's military presence in Europe, to the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nGrimble told CBS News that his analysis showed such a scenario would leave NATO a \"hollowed out, unprepared shell\" by pursuing a policy of NATO \"dormancy.\"\n\nIn Grimble's war game, Trump takes advantage of NATO's command structure in which the supreme allied commander of NATO forces in Europe is always a U.S. officer and is responsible for the overall command of NATO military operations.\n\n\"NATO has these war-fighting plans that are ready to roll out\u2026 but the supreme allied commander in Europe would answer to Donald Trump,\" Grimble told CBS News.\n\n\"You tell [the NATO supreme allied commander] to stop cooperating, to stop enacting the plans, and the whole thing falls apart. And that's what Trump did in the game,\" he said.",

While this theory has been well-established in existing literature, whether it still holds in today's high-choice media environment, which includes news producers of different credibility and ideology dispositions, is an open question. Through two case studies--the 2016 and 2020 U.S. presidential elections--we show that media are still largely aligned, especially in broad topics they choose to cover, and that the level of alignment along the credibility dimension is comparable to that along the ideology dimension. Furthermore, we find that the coverage of the Republican candidate is better aligned across different media types than that of the Democratic candidate, and that media divergence has increased along both dimensions from 2016 to 2020. Finally, we demonstrate that high-credibility media still plays a dominant role in the IAS process, yet with a cautious warning of its declining IAS power for the Democratic candidate over the course of four years.",

        "text": "Democrats unveil plan to get Biden on Ohio general election ballot\n\u201cJoe Biden will be on the ballot in Ohio and all 50 states, and Ohio Republicans agree,\u201d Democratic National Committee chairman Jaime Harrison said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cBut when the time has come for action, they have failed to act every time, so Democrats will land this plane on our own.\"\n\nHeld in a presidential election year, party conventions take place during the summer over three days of pomp and pageantry.\n\nA party convention typically culminates with an in-person roll call of every US state and territory nominating their choice of candidate, which is determined by how many votes the individual earned in a preceding primary contest.\n\nThe candidate is formally certified as the party nominee on the final day.\n\nIn 2020, the Democratic and Republican conventions were largely virtual affairs because of Covid-19 restrictions on social gatherings.\n\nEach party had planned to return to a more extravagant format this year.\n\nRepublicans will gather in Milwaukee, Wisconsin from 15 to 18 July to re-nominate former President Donald Trump, while Democrats will meet in Chicago, Illinois from 19 to 22 August to select Mr Biden again.\n\nThe party that holds the White House - in this case the Democrats - typically holds its convention after the opposing party's event, but Ohio's Republican elections chief had warned in April that the DNC event falls foul of state election laws.\n\nOhio requires political parties to officially confirm their presidential and vice-presidential nominees to the elections chief 90 or more days before the early November general election.\n\nIn a letter earlier this month to state Democrats, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose said he was \"duty-bound to instruct boards of elections to begin preparing ballots\" that did not include the names of Mr Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris.\n\nSuch conflicts have been resolved with little drama in the past, with Ohio itself making exceptions for Mr Trump in 2020 and Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee.\n\nThis year, Democrats in Washington state and Republicans in Alabama made the provisional changes necessary to exempt Mr Biden from ballot deadlines.\n\nBut Republicans in the Ohio state legislature expressed opposition to such a solution this year, with the House Speaker quoted as saying \"there's just not the will do that\".\n\nLawmakers were called into a special legislative session at the state capitol on Tuesday by Governor Mike DeWine, a moderate Republican who has urged an end to the \"absurd situation\".\n\nBut as the session began, doubts remained over whether the body would implement its own fix, and Democrats told US media they were taking matters into their own hands.\n\n\"Through a virtual roll call, we will ensure that Republicans can\u2019t chip away at our democracy through incompetence or partisan tricks and that Ohioans can exercise their right to vote for the presidential candidate of their choice,\" Mr Harrison said in his Tuesday statement.\n\nIt remains unclear when the roll call will take place and whether it will involve every single state and territory.\n\nOhio, once viewed as a swing state, has become increasingly conservative.\n\nMr Trump won Ohio in both 2016 and 2020, defeating Hillary Clinton and Mr Biden by roughly 8% margins on each occasion.\n\nThe fight over Ohio's ballot comes after another partisan clash earlier this year - one that threatened Mr Trump's ballot appearance.\n\nOfficials in Colorado, Illinois and Maine ruled that the Republican was barred from returning to the White House under a Civil War-era insurrection clause in the US Constitution.\n\nThe US Supreme Court ultimately knocked down that decision in March, ruling that Mr Trump must be placed on the three states' presidential ballots.",

        "text": "Understanding Russian Disinformation and How the Joint Force Can Address It\nMichael J. Kelley\n\n\u00a9Michael J. Kelley 2024\n\nABSTRACT: Russia will dominate information warfare if the United States does not treat disinformation as central to Russian strategy. This article examines the vital role disinformation played in post\u2013Cold War Russian strategy, including its strategy in the current Russia-Ukraine War, and in a departure from previous scholarship, this article observes that US defense leaders are aware of Russian disinformation but have failed to assess its impact or sufficiently negate Russian influence. The article also reviews current US efforts and suggests proactive ways to counter Russia\u2019s disinformation strategy.\n\nKeywords: Russia, Ukraine, information operations, disinformation, information literacy\n\nFollowing the 2022 Ukraine invasion, BBC reporters launched a yearlong investigation into Yala News after it posted a story alleging an American plot to conduct biological warfare against Russia by releasing infected birds that would fly into Russian territory. The investigation was prompted by a remarkably similar story broadcast by Russian state media two hours earlier. The investigation revealed that Yala\u2019s most popular stories mirrored sources owned by or affiliated with the Russian government, including false accounts of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky giving a drunken speech and Ukrainian soldiers fleeing the front lines, both of which appeared on Yala shortly after originating from official Russian sources. Bel\u00e9n Carrasco Rodr\u00edguez, one of the BBC\u2019s contacts, coined the term \u201cinformation laundering\u201d to describe the phenomenon of false narratives gaining credibility through repetition by multiple sources. In the United States, most observers likely dismiss stories about bio-weaponized birds. Can the same be said about information consumers outside the West?1\n\nAlongside traditional national power elements like military and economic operations, Russia generally controls perceptions among targeted audiences to shape the environment to its benefit. While every country controls narratives to some extent, few emphasize information operations on par with Russia. The United States could have taken advantage of this knowledge when Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election surfaced. Instead, partisan squabbling about which side Russia preferred to win muted those reactions. Subsequent fighting over \u201cfake news\u201d in media, political parties, and across American kitchen tables has provided Russian disinformation practitioners with cover as they ply their craft.\n\nLagging behind the Russian adversary, the United States has slowly realized that the information element can be crucial to outcomes, with the US Army only recently releasing a doctrinal publication on the topic. Perhaps this document represents a dawning realization in the defense establishment that lethality alone is unlikely to be decisive. This new publication begins by refreshing a lexicon for information operations, including disinformation, a key aspect of Russia\u2019s information operations campaigns.\n\nDisinformation is incomplete, incorrect, or out of context information deliberately used to influence audiences. Disinformation creates narratives that can spread quickly and instill an array of emotions and behaviors among groups, ranging from disinterest to violence. Relevant actors employ disinformation to shape public opinion, attract partners, weaken alliances, sow discord among populations, and deceive forces. Disinformation has a malicious intent.2\n\nWhile news stories like the one about the infected birds may seem ridiculous, especially to Western audiences, repeating such narratives to vulnerable audiences erodes global trust in the United States. For the United States to succeed in the information domain, it must recognize that disinformation is central to Russian strategy and address it proactively. This article begins by reviewing disinformation\u2019s central role in Russian strategy from the Cold War to the Russia-Ukraine War. It then examines the steps the United States has taken to counter Russian disinformation and recommends ways the US defense community can meet the challenge Russia poses in the information domain.\n\nThe Russian Approach to Disinformation\n\nNot to be confused with Western debates surrounding the term, Russian doctrine embraces hybrid warfare, which it defines as \u201ca strategic-level effort to shape the governance and geostrategic orientation of a target state in which all actions, up to and including the use of conventional military forces in regional conflicts, are subordinate to an information campaign.\u201d A 2016 RAND Corporation report described the contemporary Russian approach to information operations as a \u201cfirehose of falsehood\u201d due to the number and diversity of communication channels and Russia\u2019s willingness to broadcast partial truths and complete fiction. Contrary to typical communication strategies, Russian information campaigns demonstrate no commitment to consistency among narratives. Instead, they focus on the volume and repetition of many themes, seeking acceptance from familiarity with the message.3\n\nDisinformation has been a pillar of Russian strategy since the Cold War, with significant time and treasure spent on disinformation relative to other forms of espionage. Journalist Mark Hollingsworth devotes a chapter to the KGB\u2019s use of disinformation in his book Agents of Influence: How the KGB Subverted Western Democracies. He cites a former KGB disinformation chief who claimed the KGB spent around 25 percent of its budget on traditional espionage, spending the remainder on \u201ca slow process focusing on what we called ideological subversion or active measures.\u201d4\n\nDuring the Cold War, the Soviet Union effectively employed disinformation to undermine American legitimacy around the world. In one campaign, the Soviets convinced many that the AIDS epidemic was born in a US lab and released by the FBI to target minority communities. Russia uses disinformation to damage trust in the US government abroad and exploit the American fascination with conspiracy theories, damaging trust regarding the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, the COVID-19 pandemic, election security, and other events. Russia has also repeatedly used disinformation campaigns to legitimize military operations. Its actions in the Republic of Georgia and Moldova\u2019s Transdniestria region exemplify a common theme: protecting ethnic Russians from various questionable threats.5\n\nWhile Russia broadcasts facts that suit its purposes, it uses disinformation in its efforts to employ reflexive control strategies. Reflexive control theory was born in the Soviet era and is used to convince another actor to make decisions against its own interests. Russia accomplishes this strategy by manipulating the information environment to allow its adversary to perceive that Russia\u2019s desired outcomes are the best choices the adversary can make. Russia often employs this method to mask or obscure the true risks and rewards of an adversary\u2019s courses of action. Since reflexive control is designed to influence decisions, disinformation can temporarily or durably alter perceptions that drive a given decision. Given that facts do not constrain its information campaigns, Russia can manufacture anything necessary to yield desired decision outcomes.6\n\nRussia uses the full spectrum of disinformation tactics to shape the environment to its benefit. Through direct seizure of control or forced shutdowns of outlets that oppose the government\u2019s actions, the Russian government exerts near-total control of media within its borders. Russian outlets such as Sputnik and Russia Today own or influence proxy outlets around the world not explicitly branded as Russian. These outlets range from newspapers to blogs to YouTube news channels. Each repeats pro-Russia talking points, with each medium using its unique style to appeal to specific, targeted audiences. Russian information warriors create false social media personas and think tanks to sow discord among adversaries, as they did before the 2016 US presidential election. These fabricated sources often strike a chord with nonmainstream Western media outlets, which echo the messages to further their agendas and unintentionally promote Russian causes.7\n\nWestern audiences are unfamiliar with the media environment inside Russia. The control and coordination across channels are alien to those accustomed to a free press. Iuliia Iashchenko has written about Russian media from Sapienza University of Rome.\n\nThe [Russian] state-run national TV has a few very important primetime political shows that serve one purpose: to spread disinformation among Russian citizens to support the main ideological track of state propaganda. The most popular channel is Russia 1, with shows like \u201cDuel\u201d (Vladimir Solovyov), \u201c60 Minutes\u201d (Olga Skabeyeva), \u201cEvening with Vladimir Solovyov\u201d (Vladimir Solovyov), the same ideological content is also prominent on Channel 1, with shows like \u201cTime Will Show\u201d (Artem Sheynin), and many others. Usually, the level of subtlety of the disinformation is much higher for international audiences. Meanwhile, in Russia, in these shows, the creators present pure ideological propaganda without any proof, and with a heavy usage of simple or vulgar speech. These shows never end up in the global feed mostly because they are too open and would ruin the political goals of the Russian government.8\n\nControlling all information spaces within its borders and having significant influence over other outlets allow Russia to exert an outsized influence over its neighbors. Many former Russian Empire or Soviet Union countries have seen the benefits of turning westward, something Putin\u2019s regime strongly opposes. Russia has used various methods centered on information warfare to prevent this theme from continuing.\n\nRussia Uses Disinformation for Its \u201cSpecial Military Operation\u201d in Ukraine\n\nRussia\u2019s first salvo in the Ukraine invasion was a disinformation operation. As Russia built up combat power along the border, Russian spokesmen announced it was a large-scale training exercise and insisted that troops and ships would soon return to normal activities. Russian officials kept up this line, objecting more stridently as Western officials pointed out inconsistencies between their statements and activities on the ground. As the world knows, Russia\u2019s statements proved false; nonetheless, its messaging prevented Ukraine and the West from responding to the buildup until Russia launched the assault. This situation is a prime example of reflexive control laden with disinformation. Russia understood its adversaries\u2019 decision processes and self-image and realized it could lie long enough to freeze their willingness to move beyond words, allowing it to seize the operational initiative. After all, it would seem unreasonable for the US European Command or NATO to respond aggressively to a training exercise. Fortunately, that disinformation initiative was insufficient to consolidate the rapid military victory Russia expected. Western intelligence sharing allowed Ukraine to steel itself at the last minute while preparing the world to see through Russia\u2019s narratives regarding the invasion.9\n\nConsistent with the \u201cfirehose of falsehood\u201d approach, Russia initially explained its actions through several competing narratives, including reuniting ethnic Russians with the motherland, maneuvering to counter NATO expansion, and fighting to excise the Ukrainian government\u2019s \u201cNazi\u201d influences. Putin even tried to deny Ukraine\u2019s very existence, claiming, \u201cUkraine never had a tradition of genuine statehood.\u201d None of these narratives survive scrutiny, and they all represent Russian disinformation to legitimize blatant efforts to expand territory and delegitimize opponents. The last significant NATO expansion occurred in 2004\u2014 hardly a credible reason for Russia to panic nearly two decades later.10\n\nIn 2004, Bulgaria, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, and former Soviet republics Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania joined NATO. Since then, only six new countries have joined, including Finland and Sweden, which joined only after and because Russia invaded Ukraine. At the other end of the reasonableness spectrum, Russia has signed several agreements affirming Ukrainian sovereignty, which undercuts Putin\u2019s statements about its right to exist and his fanciful claims that Ukraine was never a legitimate state. Still, NATO has repeatedly had to debunk claims that the Alliance is trying to threaten and encircle Russia, lest other countries take these assertions at face value.11\n\nRussia has used disinformation to attack the global coalition aligned in support of Ukraine by undermining that support within those countries and sowing disunity among them. One independent analysis of Russian messaging determined that French, German, Polish, and Turkish audiences were heavily targeted through at least five specific themes, which aligned with those shown in an alleged Russian document published by Ukrainian intelligence services. The themes addressing the costs of Ukrainian aid and dealing with refugees could be dismissed as competing narratives. Still, one theme listed in the document is clearly disinformation:\n\nUpdate information about neo-Nazis in Europe, make a comparison with Ukraine in order to show the European community how Nazism is born and ask why they ban Nazis in their countries, but support them in Ukraine? For these purposes, it is advisable to use BBC documentaries about neo-Nazis and Nazis.\n\nThis analysis lists dozens of information operations tied to official and proxy Russian sources that do everything from claiming imminent NATO aggression against Russia to discrediting Western media. Weaponizing the US military\u2019s credibility, it was likely Russia behind a 2023 leak of US military documents modified to make Russian casualty numbers look better than the original documents represented.12\n\nAlthough many Russian disinformation narratives may seem unlikely or even ridiculous to Western countries and allies, they may seem more plausible to audiences in countries already predisposed to dislike and distrust the West. The disinformation about bio-weaponized birds was not aimed at the West and is unlikely to affect public opinion. It is among hundreds of Russian-origin fake news designed to cause distrust of Russian adversaries. When water falls on a rock, erosion occurs one drop at a time. It is impossible to notice changes at first, but the rock is completely reshaped over time. Similarly, in spaces where the West is less likely to detect and contest its narratives, Russia employs disinformation like the bird story more aggressively. Where these narratives take root, American combatant commanders will likely find more resistance to their actions in their respective regions.\n\nRussian support has propped up the Alexander Lukashenko regime in Belarus to control messaging and the electoral process. Lukashenko expresses his appreciation for these efforts by making Belarus a vassal state to serve Russian interests. Russian military forces have occupied portions of the Republic of Georgia for several years to buffer the Russian border and have sufficiently managed the information surrounding the operation to prevent worldwide outrage. In 2014, Russia used a combination of special operations forces and information operations to manipulate a referendum, forcing Ukrainian citizens from Crimea to give Russia control of the strategically important peninsula in the Black Sea. Having effectively seized Crimea, Russia did not need a referendum to hold power there. Nonetheless, the fa\u00e7ade of legitimacy represented an information operation targeting those who may have considered intervening to eject Russia by force or other means. Before and after the 2022 Ukraine invasion, Russia undertook similar operations within the Ukrainian Donbas and Luhansk regions along the border with Russia.13\n\nGiven Russia\u2019s potency, observers may expect a certain amount of \u201ccognitive dissonance\u201d within the population should Ukraine recover control of these places. The liberation of Russian-held territory is, therefore, more than a kinetic concern. Winning the fight will be insufficient. Russia understands the population must be convinced to be liberated, as demonstrated in its approach to Crimea, Donbas, Luhansk, and Transdniestria. Russia\u2019s ability to wield information to achieve its strategic goals poses challenges for regional governance. Both inside and outside Russia, information manipulation challenges many vital aspects of governance, including transparency, accountability, inclusion, public participation, and the rule of law.14\n\nDoes Disinformation Work?\n\nIt may be that the American national security establishment has failed to focus on the disinformation problem because its effects are unquantifiable. Despite ample examples of Russian actions, cause and effect in the information environment is not always clear. Disinformation does not exist in a vacuum; it is one variable in the information environment that influences and is influenced by culture, previous events, bias and opinion, misinformation, and the observed truth. The same channels that deliver disinformation deliver all these factors, resulting in great difficulty associating a singular cause and effect. Most disinformation campaigns are not designed to yield precise results but to create chaos, doubt, mistrust, and confusion. Clearly, Russia places great emphasis on shaping the environment in this manner. With the past as a prologue, Russia will conduct information operations using disinformation in concert with more conventional power in future military operations, as it has attempted in Ukraine, with mixed results.\n\nOne way to assess effectiveness is to see whether disinformation enters public discourse. For many years, Russia claimed biological research facilities in Ukraine were centers for biological weapons production. In 2022, a viral Twitter (now X) hashtag led to a US Senate hearing. These claims were subsequently repeated on Tucker Carlson\u2019s popular show on Fox News, using selectively clipped testimonies to bolster those claims. The following day, Russian state television cited Carlson\u2019s program. Following an explosion that damaged a gas pipeline in the Baltic Sea, Russian officials quickly lashed out at the United States, publicly accusing it of sabotage. Carlson also picked up that story, again bolstering Russia\u2019s sensationalized version. Carlson had tremendous reach as the host of America\u2019s most popular infotainment program. His Kremlin-friendly approach led to Putin\u2019s first Western interview since the Russia-Ukraine War began, despite multiple previous requests from other journalists worldwide. Carlson\u2019s programming offers a stark example of Russian disinformation creeping into American mainstream media, but there are also more subtle ones.15\n\nRecent analysis revealed the Russian promotion of anti-immigration themes in the United States to weaken support for Ukraine assistance funding. These efforts are evident in Sputnik and Russia Today broadcasts, on X (formerly Twitter), and other Russian-affiliated social media sites. Russian efforts in the Western Hemisphere are not limited to the United States. A recently declassified US intelligence product demonstrated how Russia deliberately fed stories and talking points to media outlets across Latin America, a charge Russia quickly denied. To borrow the BBC\u2019s term, each example represents a form of information laundering. Although challenging to quantify, Russian disinformation efforts seem to be sowing a measure of chaos and distrust in the United States at home and abroad. The Joint Force plays a role in resolving this problem.16\n\nConsiderations for the Joint Force\n\nThe Joint Force has already addressed information as a critical feature in future conflict by acknowledging, in written doctrine, the value of information operations. In 2022, the US Department of Defense published Information in Joint Operations (Joint Publication 3-04). The Army followed with Information (Army Doctrine Publication 3-13), the next year. (The Navy is still developing its information operations community, and the Marine Corps and Air Force have their supporting doctrine.) The Army publication cites the Joint document early on, stating, \u201c[t]he essence of informational power is the ability to exert one\u2019s will through the projection, exploitation, denial, and preservation of information in pursuit of objectives.\u201d The development of specific doctrines means the Department of Defense and the services intend for commanders to use information in their plans and operations.17\n\nThe Army\u2019s Information publication lists reasons Joint commanders should apply \u201cinformational power.\u201d The first item, \u201c[t]o operate in situations where the use of destructive or disruptive physical force is not authorized or is not an appropriate course of action,\u201d bears the greatest need for emphasis. Except within US Central Command with continuing strikes in Syria and Yemen, no US combatant commander is using destructive physical force. Often, most commanders are not engaged in combat operations, leaving information among the few tools available for daily operations, including cyber and space efforts. As such, combatant commanders should allocate more of their organizations\u2019 daily focus to the information environment. With that additional focus, combatant commands will more likely detect and understand disinformation campaigns directed toward the United States and its allies and disarm them more rapidly and effectively.18\n\nAmerican information warriors counter disinformation in real time by deliberately and aggressively employing truthful information. Critically, they must act rapidly to counter disinformation and even to anticipate it and \u201cpre-bunk\u201d expected narratives. In the age of 24-hour news cycles and memes that seize attention and fade quickly, velocity matters. The current processes for preparing, clearing, and approving information releases are woefully unresponsive and slow, leaving the initiative to the bad actors on the information battlefield. At the same time, combatant commanders must coordinate these efforts among other commands and interagency organizations with the authority to act within the information space. This approach will require inviting other commands and interagency organizations into the process at a level high enough for information releases to happen with appropriate rapidity.\n\nThe US intelligence community recognizes the need for change in this arena. While being mindful of protecting sensitive sources and methods, it has challenged previous paradigms to declassify and release classified information to counter disinformation rapidly. When Russia initiated its invasion of Ukraine with lies regarding its reasons for aggregating combat power along the border, the United States and the United Kingdom partnered to share sensitive intelligence, including intercepted communications, demonstrating that Russia was misleading observers about their intentions. Since then, the United States has continued this approach on a limited basis, including providing a warning that Russia intended to employ chemical weapons in Ukraine.19\n\nThese releases are not without risk. Astute intelligence services like those in Russia can use them to find and address intelligence vulnerabilities. For some in the intelligence community, this concept goes against long-held preferences to keep intelligence buried deep, lest the collection method get \u201cburned\u201d and become unusable. Still, the rapid declassification and release of select intelligence has been effective enough that commanders and leaders across the US government should continue to use this approach judiciously. It fits well with the idea that sharing the truth benefits the United States and the West. Note the word \u201cjudiciously\u201d here. The intelligence community must continue considering risks to sources and methods, and the secondary effects of publicizing the information. Nevertheless, by changing the intelligence community\u2019s culture to value this approach, the United States can find additional success in the information contest.\n\nOther US government efforts to counter disinformation have yielded mixed results. On April 24, 2022, the Biden-Harris administration launched an official \u201cDisinformation Governance Board\u201d within the Department of Homeland Security.20 Political opposition forced it to disband after 25 days (on May 18, 2022). The Foreign Malign Influence Center came to life in September 2022 and has been spared partisan flames.21 Congress approved the center, which was placed under the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Its principal mission is coordination and analysis across the interagency and intelligence community, but it relies on other agencies to intervene against foreign actions.\n\nIn 2017, the FBI set up its Foreign Influence Task Force. Unlike the Foreign Malign Influence Center, the task force can direct and conduct investigations leading to criminal convictions that disrupt disinformation and other influence operations. In 2019, Maria Butina was sentenced to 18 months in prison for operating as an unregistered agent of Russia. Butina used Russian connections to access and influence American politicians associated with the National Rifle Association organization until an FBI investigation undid her efforts. Agents of influence like Butina represent more precisely directed information operations than those designed to create chaos. Joint Force authorities must collect and share information about these matters to support counter-disinformation efforts.22\n\nThe proposals to coordinate pre-bunking disinformation across US government agencies have limitations. This approach relies on using the truth to repair or prevent damage wrought by disinformation. Unfortunately, research indicates that challenging false narratives with the truth is largely ineffective. Target audiences of disinformation campaigns must be better prepared to avoid their effects to overcome this limitation. To this end, a new program supporting information literacy should be launched. Combatant commanders are charged with promoting various strategic programs within their areas of responsibility. An information literacy program would be an important tool in their arsenals. The Association of College and Research Libraries defines information literacy as \u201cthe set of integrated abilities encompassing the reflective discovery of information, the understanding of how information is produced and valued, and the use of information in creating new knowledge and participating ethically in communities of learning.\u201d Information literacy is a growing area of interest within academia, given the increasing prevalence of faulty information sources, including certain AI-generated information.23\n\nCombatant commanders are well positioned to champion this effort. The Joint Force has various options for delivering such an effort, either unilaterally or in partnership with other agencies, such as the US Agency for International Development. Alongside psychological operations professionals, US Army Civil Affairs personnel represent one potential source of forces to execute such a campaign alongside foreign partners. Charged with promoting civic and social conditions necessary for the Army, civil affairs practitioners work with foreign partners and populations on governance, infrastructure, and civil population concerns. They could be trained to roll out information literacy packages to inoculate foreign partners against infusions of disinformation.\n\nIn constructing this program, the United States should avoid the hubris of acting alone and collaborate with allies and partners with Russian experience. By combining best practices with the amplification uniquely available in the United States, this campaign may succeed over time. If we believe telling authentic stories about the West\u2019s conduct is a powerful attraction tool, people must absorb and accept those attractive narratives. Partners prepared to evaluate information sources, challenge narratives, differentiate fact from fiction, and approach information with appropriate skepticism are less likely to fall for Russian fake news designed to dissuade them from working with the United States.\n\nConclusion\n\nRussian disinformation is here to stay. The Soviet Union and Russia have relied on hybrid warfare and reflexive control throughout modern history. Disinformation is a critical tool for those strategies. Now that the need to join the information fight has been officially acknowledged, operational commanders must implement the Joint Force\u2019s doctrine in the ongoing, daily information contest. Regular, timely, and accurate intelligence and information releases can blunt the effects of Russian operations and improve conditions for the United States worldwide. A well-designed global information literacy program would support this campaign.\n\nThis proposal may raise the ire of those who believe the US military\u2019s only purpose is to fight and win kinetic wars. The Joint Force is involved in many other activities to advance America\u2019s strategic interests. The recent publication of information operations doctrine across the Joint Force represents the realization that information is a critical tool for commanders. From this perspective, an information literacy campaign can be seen as battlefield preparation. Correctly done, this campaign will better prepare allies, partners, and others to accept truthful Western narratives and reject disinformation disseminated by adversaries.\n\nMichael J.

        "text": "Japan\u2019s Response to a Chinese Invasion of Taiwan: A Four Year Outlook\nIn January 2024, the Center for Strategic and International Studies\u2019 (CSIS) China Power Project published survey results of US and Taiwanese experts on China's invasion of Taiwan in relation to the Taiwan presidential election. The result showed a majority of both US and Taiwan experts assessed that a crisis is either likely or very likely in 2024. The crisis includes direct invasion of Taiwan as well as quarantine and blockade. As for the US intervention, a majority believe that the United States is unlikely to intervene in a contingency involving Taiwan\u2019s remote islands, but likely in a high kinetic joint blockade or an invasion of the main island of Taiwan.\n\nWhile expectations for US intervention are generally high, confidence in US allies and partners\u2019 intervention is not high in all situations, from isolation to invasion. Even in the case of full-fledged invasion of the main island of Taiwan, 30 percent of US experts and 48 percent of Taiwanese experts say they have less or not at all confidence on the intervention. For experts in both countries, it is certain that Japan is on their minds.\n\nHowever, as former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said that the Taiwan contingency is a Japan contingency and a Japan-US alliance contingency, the Japanese strategic community generally believes that the Taiwan Strait contingency will spill over to Japan. As the Kishida Cabinet positioned China as \"the biggest and unprecedented strategic challenge\" on the 2022 National Security Strategy, there is a strong sense of caution toward China. Thereafter, the government of Japan (GOJ) has substantially increased its defense budget for acquiring new defense capabilities by 2027, while strengthening the defense posture of the Nansei (Southwest) Islands. It is also true that not a small number of influential Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) lawmakers believe that Taiwan and Japan's security are closely related, as former Prime Minister Taro Aso hinted that a \u201csurvival threatening situation\u201d (so-called right of collective self-defense) would be exercised in the event of a Taiwan contingency.\n\nFour Drivers of the Japanese Government\n\nThere would be four drivers that motivate the GOJ to intervene in a Taiwan contingency: (1) Chinese government\u2019s Taiwan policy, (2) US government\u2019s Taiwan policy under the Taiwan Relations Act, (3) the US-China strategic nuclear power balance, and (4) geostrategic value of Taiwan to Japan.\n\nChina\u2019s Taiwan Policy\n\nThe GOJ\u2019s Taiwan policy is based on the Japan-China Joint Communiqu\u00e9 of 1972. The GOJ\u2019s response in the event that China initiates a status quo change across the Taiwan Strait would be implemented in accordance with this joint communiqu\u00e9.\n\nThe GOJ understood Beijing\u2019s assertion that Taiwan is part of China, but this is only insofar as unification by the Beijing is carried out peacefully. In this context, it is considered that the GOJ has reserved the option to meet a situation that China attempts unification by non-peaceful means, such as coercive military means. In other words, in the event of a military invasion by China, the GOJ could stand by and watch, or it could intervene in the Sino-Taiwanese conflict in some way by deeming it an act of deviation from the Communiqu\u00e9. In the latter case, the GOJ would not rule out responding to the Taiwan Strait crisis by military means.\n\nThe US government's Taiwan policy\n\nThe US government's Taiwan policy is the most significant driver. The US government is likely to militarily support the defense of Taiwan in accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979. President Joe Biden has stated repeatedly that he does not support Taiwan's independence but that America will fight to defend Taiwan. With considering that former President Donald Trump did not rule out defending Taiwan either, it is likely that there will be no major change in Taiwan policy no matter who wins the November 2024 presidential election in the United States.\n\nEven if the United States does not directly participate in the war, the US military bases geographically available to support Taiwan are only in Japan and the Philippines. Prior consultation is required under the Japan-US Security Treaty when the United States uses the bases in Japan for military activities in Taiwan, but it is unlikely that the GOJ would refuse to consult with the United States, although not explicitly stated. In addition, if the US government requests Japan\u2019s logistical support for the US military, the GOJ can certify an \u201cimportant influence situation\u201d and order the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) to provide supply, transportation, lodging, search and rescue, and other services to US military units. In the event of an attack on US military bases in Japan, the GOJ undoubtedly certifies an \u201carmed attack situation\u201d or \u201csurvival threatening situation,\u201d and launch a defense operation, either independently or collectively with the United States.\n\nStrategic Nuclear Power Balance\n\nThe US-China strategic nuclear power balance not only affects the credibility of US extended deterrence, but it also affects US defense support for Taiwan, just as the Biden administration was reportedly affected by Russian nuclear intimidation in Ukraine.\n\nThe implications are broad and complex. For example, in order to deescalate the situation, the United States could (1) hesitate to provide offensive weapons to Taiwan; (2) limit its support only to intelligence and logistical support; (3) not involve US forces in direct military operations, or (4) even discourage Taiwan authorities from attacking military targets in mainland China. There is also a possibility that the US government will ask the GOJ to refrain from supporting Taiwan authorities.\n\nThe most serious concern is that if US-China strategic nuclear forces reach parity in the 2030s, there will be an increased possibility that China believes that the United States is unlikely to intervene in a Taiwan contingency. An emerging \"stability-instability paradox\" greatly reduces the probability of a major war but increases the probability of a small-scale or indirect war between the two countries. In other words, China would be able to change the status quo in the Taiwan Strait through the skillful use of superior non-strategic nuclear weapons and conventional weapons.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s Geostrategic Value to Japan\n\nThe fourth driver is Taiwan's geostrategic value to Japan. Japan and Taiwan are liberal democracies that share many values, strong economic ties, and close relations with millions of people coming and going annually. Taiwan is located at the convergence of maritime traffic in and out of the South China Sea, East China Sea, and Pacific Ocean. In addition, Taiwan, together with Japan, can act as a geographical barrier to control China's free access to the Pacific Ocean.\n\nOn the other hand, if China unifies Taiwan, China would have a base from which to expand its influence into the Pacific without obstacles, decisively altering the strategic balance in the western Pacific. In that case, China's naval and air power would restrain the deployment of US forces to the Western Pacific, and Japan would have to prepare for threats from the continental side and from the Pacific simultaneously. In other words, maintaining the status quo in Taiwan is a critical issue that directly affects Japan's survival and prosperity.\n\nWhile the US government has intentionally kept its Taiwan policy ambiguous, the shifting US-China strategic nuclear power balance toward parity continues to add uncertainty to US Taiwan policy. In this strategic climate, Taiwan's geostrategic value would provide the basis for the GOJ to determine whether to intervene in Taiwan without being dragged down by the US policy.\n\nTriangle Approach\n\nJapan doesn\u2019t have diplomatic relations with Taiwan due to historical factors since Japan's annexation of Taiwan in 1895. The GOJ has strictly adhered to the principle of non-governmental business exchanges and distanced itself from Taiwan. While diplomatic negotiations may have continued behind the scenes, exchanges between the two defense authorities ceased altogether.\n\nIf a Taiwan Strait crisis is to heighten in 2027, it will be necessary to find effective measures to improve the situation in a short period of time. However, it is impossible for Taipei and Tokyo to directly discuss military cooperation. A realistic approach would be an indirect one with the United States in the middle.\n\nGiven that two of the four drivers that motivate the GOJ to intervene in Taiwan are related to US Taiwan policy, the first possibility is Japan\u2019s proactive involvement in US Taiwan policy.\n\nFor example, through policy discussions on the Taiwan contingency, the two governments could share situation awareness and the roles and missions in assumed situations. They could also discuss politically sensitive but crucially important issues, such as the timing of US stand-in forces\u2019 prior deployment to the Nansei Islands.\n\nAs for information sharing between Japan and Taiwan, although it lacked speed, the Japan-US-South Korea triangle framework prior to the conclusion of the Japan-South Korea General Security of Military Information Agreement would be a useful reference.\n\nWhile Japan's contribution regarding the strategic nuclear power balance is limited, the credibility of US extended deterrence can be enhanced if the United States, Japan, and South Korea achieve trilateral extended deterrence consultation and provide conventional support to the US nuclear forces cooperatively by Japan and South Korea.\n\nIn terms of military activities, if the SDF should organically integrate new defense capabilities such as counterstrike and standoff defense capabilities into the US defense posture, it could strengthen the US comprehensive deterrence capability.\n\nThe sharing of operational concepts could be achieved through Japanese observer participation in regular meetings of US and Taiwanese military authorities or by inviting Taiwan to multilateral joint exercises organized by US Indo-Pacific Command. A track two meeting with participation from Japan, the United States, and Taiwan could be utilized to discuss Taiwan-Japan military cooperation. A joint policy simulation involving lawmakers is expected to promote mutual understanding and sharing of issues related to political decisionmaking.",

        "text": "U.S. House Administration Committee considers several election bills ahead of 2024 General Elections\nKey Takeaways\n\nOn May 23, the U.S. House Administration Committee held a full committee markup session in which it considered the following federal elections legislation:\n\nBoth bills considered were reported to the House floor favorably on party-line votes after several amendments, including those that included the text of the DISCLOSE Act of 2023 and the Freedom to Vote Act, offered by House Administration Committee Ranking Member Rep. Joe Morelle (D-N.Y.) were voted down.\n\nWhat would these bills do?\n\nIntroduced by Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) and championed by Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-La.), the SAVE Act (H.R. 8281) would require individuals to provide documentary proof of U.S. citizenship with a voting registration application. The requirement to provide photo identification would also apply to voter registration processes with applications for motor vehicle driver\u2019s licenses under the National Voter Registration Act of 1993.\n\n\n\nH.R. 8281 would also require individuals that register using the National Mail Voter Registration Form to provide documentary proof of U.S. citizenship in person to the office of the appropriate election official responsible for voter registration in the state. This legislation also directs states to establish a process for removing non-citizens from existing voter rolls, an alternative process for U.S. citizens who lack documentary proof of citizenship and sets forth federal penalties for knowingly registering non-citizens to vote in federal elections.\n\n\n\nIntroduced by U.S. House Administration Committee Chair Bryan Steil (R-Wis.), the Preventing Foreign Interference in American Elections Act (H.R. 8399) would prohibit foreign nationals from funding U.S. election administration and get-out-the-vote activities and make clarifications to the existing ban on foreign nationals providing indirect contributions. The legislation would also restrict federal agencies from disclosing the identity of donors to tax-exempt organizations.\n\nHow do these bills impact counties?\n\nCounties play a limited direct role in the voter registration processes, other than in states that allow same-day voter registration at polling places. The SAVE Act could require counties to modify their voter identification requirements for same-day registration depending on its state\u2019s current laws and regulations. County election offices would also be responsible for voter outreach and poll worker training on this legislation, which currently does not include federal funding to help cover costs of these activities.\n\nNACo will continue to advocate for county priorities in election administration while monitoring these bills and will keep members apprised of any future developments.",

        "text": "MFAH Is Only U.S. Venue for Major Retrospective of Thomas Demand\nThe large-scale photographic works of the influential artist explore the intersections of history, images, and architectural forms.\n\nHOUSTON\u2014May 29, 2024\u2014Thomas Demand has spent three decades exploring the intersections of history, photography, and memory. His large-scale photographic works investigate the way images embed themselves in a society\u2019s collective memory. From June 30 through September 15, 2024, the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, will present Thomas Demand: The Stutter of History, a landmark retrospective of the artist\u2019s work featuring 58 images; the MFAH is the only U.S. venue for this internationally touring exhibition.\n\nIn much of his work, Demand depicts places loaded with historical meaning\u2014the abandoned control room of the Fukushima plant following the March 2011 nuclear disaster; the site of the Florida recount of the 2000 American presidential election; or the ransacked offices of the East German secret police after the fall of the Berlin Wall. While Demand\u2019s images appear at first to depict the real world, upon closer inspection they seem at once familiar and decidedly strange. They are in fact photographs of impermanent sculptural re-creations. Demand selects his source imagery from the media; re-creates those often-banal images as life-size models using colored paper and cardboard; photographs them; and prints them at a monumental scale. Ultimately, his works are as much about the circulation of images and the politics of memory as they are about the specific moments depicted.\n\n\u201cThe exhibition Thomas Demand: The Stutter of History marks the first time in nearly 20 years that Demand\u2019s work has been shown in the U.S. in such depth,\u201d said Gary Tinterow, Director and Margaret Alkek Williams Chair at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. \u201cI am delighted that the Museum has been given the singular opportunity to show the extraordinary and challenging photographs that result from Demand\u2019s unsettling explorations of how photography both reveals and deceives, prompting visitors to question their perceptions and fundamental truths.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe uncanny nature of Thomas Demand\u2019s work lies in its ability to trick our perception and our assumptions,\u201d commented Malcolm Daniel, the Gus and Lyndall Wortham Curator of Photography at the MFAH. \u201cWe are lured in because we think we have seen this before, only to discover that what we are looking at is just a stage set. And that moment of recognition in turn leads us to think about the veracity of the images we receive endlessly, every day.\u201d\n\nThomas Demand: The Stutter of History presents a career-wide survey of four important areas of Demand\u2019s work: large-scale photographs of unidentified yet historically significant scenarios; smaller-scale \u201cDailies,\u201d re-creating everyday epiphanies recorded with his iPhone; \u201cModel Studies\u201d that document the paper maquettes created by architects and dress patterns cut by fashion designers; and mesmerizing stop-motion films including Pacific Sun, inspired by YouTube footage of a cruise ship\u2019s interior as fixtures and furniture are tossed by rough seas. In addition, the installation includes site-specific photographic wallpapers at key points in the exhibition.\n\nDemand initially took up photography in order to document the ephemeral paper reconstructions of everyday objects that he was making as part of his sculpture practice at the Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf in the early 1990s. But he soon began making these constructions for the sole purpose of photographing them, establishing the basis of his artistic practice. After Demand photographs his models, he destroys them, leaving behind only their ghostly photographic doubles. The \u201cstutter of history\u201d evoked by the exhibition\u2019s title lies in that strange gap between the world we inhabit and the re-created world of paper and cardboard that the artist conjures in his studio. The exhibition is accompanied by a catalogue.\n\nAbout Thomas Demand\n\nThomas Demand (born in Munich, 1964) studied sculpture at the Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf, where he initially studied with sculptor Fritz Schwegler, who encouraged him to explore the expressive possibilities of models, and later at Goldsmiths, University of London. Demand has had one-person exhibitions at museums including the Museum of Modern Art in New York; Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin; Museum of Contemporary Art in Tokyo; Garage Museum of Contemporary Art in Moscow; Fundac\u00edon Bot\u00edn in Santander, Spain; Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, Humbl\u00e6k, Denmark (2003); Serpentine Gallery, London, UK (2006); and most recently at the Jeu de Paume in Paris (2023). In 2004 he represented Germany at the S\u00e3o Paulo Biennial. Demand lives and works in Berlin and Los Angeles.\n\nOrganization and Funding\n\nThis exhibition has been co-organized by the Foundation for the Exhibition of Photography, Minneapolis/Paris/Lausanne, and Ullens Center for Contemporary Art, Beijing/Shanghai, in collaboration with the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston.\n\nMajor support is provided by:\n\nBobbie Nau\n\nAdditional support is provided by:\n\nMatthew Marks Gallery\n\nKvadrat\n\nAnne Levy Charitable Trust\n\nJereann and Holland Chaney\n\nJoan Morgenstern\n\nAbout the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston\n\nSpanning 14 acres in the heart of Houston\u2019s Museum District, the Fayez S. Sarofim Campus of the MFAH comprises the Audrey Jones Beck Building, the Caroline Wiess Law Building, the Nancy and Rich Kinder Building, and the Lillie and Hugh Roy Cullen Sculpture Garden. Nearby, two house museums\u2014Bayou Bend Collection and Gardens, and Rienzi\u2014present collections of American and European decorative arts. The MFAH is also home to the Glassell School of Art, with its Core Residency Program and Junior and Studio schools; and the International Center for the Arts of the Americas (ICAA), a leading research institute for 20th-century Latin American and Latino art.\n\nMedia Contact\n\nMelanie Fahey, Senior Publicist\n\nmfahey@mfah.org | 713.800.5345",

        "text": "dentsu\nGlobal advertising spend is now forecast to grow by 5.0% in 2024 (vs. 3.3% in 2023) to reach $754.4 billion, as spend prospects improve in the UK, Germany, US, Japan, and France.\n\nDigital is beating previous growth expectations and is now predicted to increase by 7.4% to capture 59.6% of global spend in 2024, with double-digit growth for retail media and paid social.\n\nThe US presidential election alone is forecast to account for about a third ($11 billion) of the incremental ad spend in 2024.\n\nAdvertising spend is forecast to grow by 5.0% globally in 2024, according to the latest dentsu Global Ad Spend Forecasts, a mid-year update examining major shifts in ad spend by geography and by media channel across 56 markets. Overall, an anticipated $754.4 billion will be spent worldwide by the end of the year. This increase year-over-year is not only more rapid than what we observed in 2023 (which itself outperformed forecasts with 3.3% growth year-over-year), it also beats the pace of the global economy by 1.8 percentage points.*\n\nIn the top 12 markets,** inflation-adjusted growth is projected at 2.6% in 2024 (vs. 5.2% at current prices), as media inflation shows signs of coming down but remains high, especially for TV and sought-after digital video formats such as social video.\n\nWill Swayne, Global Practice President - Media, dentsu said:\n\n\u201cThe year has started at a faster pace than previously anticipated, and we predict spend to maintain momentum in the second half of the year with major sporting events drawing global attention. The November US presidential election alone is forecast to account for about a third ($11 billion) of the incremental ad spend in 2024.\u201d\n\nFrom a channel perspective, the 2024 dentsu Global Ad Spend Forecasts report highlights that digital is expected to remain the fastest growing channel at 7.4% to reach $449.3 billion and 59.6% of global ad spend. Substantial ad spend increases are forecast for retail media (+32.0% YOY, 17.7% three-year CAGR to 2026), paid social (+13.7% YOY), and programmatic (+10.9% YOY), while paid search (+7.7% YOY) and online video (+6.7% YOY) are set to maintain strong growth.\n\nAlthough its share of spend is predicted to slightly contract to 22.5%, television is forecast to rise by 2.6% and attract $170.0 billion in investments in 2024. Growth is driven by spend in connected TV (+24.2% YOY), as streaming platforms ramp up their advertising offerings, and is currently enough to counter the decline in broadcast television spend (-0.4% YOY).\n\nWhile print advertising spend is forecast to continue to contract (-2.6% YOY), the other media channels are expected to increase in 2024, with out-of-home growing by 4.2%, audio by 0.4%, and cinema by 4.8%.\n\nGlobal ad spend forecasts in the May 2024 edition of the dentsu Global Ad Spend Forecasts have been revised up from December 2023 based on improving outlooks in some of the biggest advertising markets: the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany, and France. In fact, ad spend growth is now expected to match or outpace GDP progression in all the twelve biggest ad markets in 2024.\n\nThe Americas is forecast to be the fastest growing region of the year at 5.9%, with the US expected to be much more dynamic at 5.9% (vs. 2.2% in 2023). At 4.2%, growth in Asia-Pacific is faster than the 2023 pace of 3.7%, with China, the biggest ad market in the region, expected to increase by 4.8% and India remaining the most dynamic market of the region at 6.8%.

        "text": "What Trump's guilty verdict means for the 2024 election\nWhat Trump's conviction means for the election\n\nGetty Images Donald Trump has campaigned on his claim he is being unfairly prosecuted\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s criminal conviction presents a remarkable collection of historic firsts. He\u2019s the first former or serving US president to be found guilty of a crime. He\u2019s the first presumptive major-party nominee to become a convicted felon as well. While Trump plans his appeal in the hush-money case, and awaits a sentence on 11 July that could in theory include prison time and a hefty fine, it\u2019s not too early to consider the political fallout. That will be difficult, however, given this has never happened before. \u201cWe often look to history to find some kind of hint of what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d says Jeffrey Engel, director of the Center for Presidential History at Southern Methodist University. \u201cBut there is nothing in the record that comes even close to this.\u201d\n\nTrump secured the Republican presidential nomination earlier this year and is scheduled to be crowned at the party's convention just days after his sentencing. LIVE UPDATES: Follow the reaction to verdict Polls indicate he is in a statistical dead heat with President Joe Biden and maintains a slight edge in many key swing states that will decide the election. But those surveys also provide evidence that this conviction might change all of that. In exit polls conducted during the Republican primaries this winter, double-digit numbers of voters said that they would not vote for the former president if he were convicted of a felony. An April survey by Ipsos and ABC News found that 16% of those backing Trump would reconsider their support in such a situation.\n\nThose were hypothetical convictions, however. And at the time he was facing four criminal cases, including charges related to an alleged conspiracy to overturn the result of the 2020 election and his handling of classified documents once leaving the White House. Now those voters can make their judgement based on a real conviction. \"The real verdict is going to be [on] 5 November, by the people,\" Trump said, moments after leaving the courtroom. Doug Schoen, a pollster who worked with Democratic President Bill Clinton and independent New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, says American voters may feel less strongly about the hush-money case by then because it relates to events that took place eight years ago. \u201cWhile it\u2019s not a great thing to be convicted of a crime, what voters will be thinking about in November is inflation, the southern border, competition with China and Russia and the money that is being spent on Israel and Ukraine,\u201d he said.\n\nEven a slight drop in Trump\u2019s support, however, might be enough to matter in the kind of razor-thin race this presidential contest could become. If a few thousand voters who would have otherwise backed the former president stay home in a key state like Wisconsin or Pennsylvania, it could make all the difference. \u201cI do think it will have an impact and damage him as a candidate,\u201d says Ariel Hill-Davis, co-founder of Republican Women for Progress, a group that has sought to move the party away from Trump. She says younger voters and those who are college-educated and live in the suburbs have been concerned about Trump\u2019s demeanour and his approach to governing. \u201cThose voters are really hesitant to get back in line with the Republican Party headed by Donald Trump,\u201d she says. \u201cThe guilty verdict is going to further shore up those concerns.\u201d But leading Republicans, many of whom attended the trial in a show of loyalty to the party nominee, were quick to rally behind him. House Speaker Mike Johnson called it a shameful day in American history. \"This was a purely political exercise, not a legal one.\"\n\nBBC reporter in court describes what Trump did after guilty verdict\n\nFor eight years, experts and opponents have been predicting Trump\u2019s impending political collapse, only to be proven wrong. His 2016 presidential campaign was punctuated by scandals that would have likely felled a typical politician, including Trump\u2019s recorded Access Hollywood conversation about groping women that was referenced multiple times in this trial. Mr Trump\u2019s party largely stuck with him through two impeachments and the chaotic end of his presidency, during which the US Capitol was attacked by a mob of his supporters. All this did not prevent the former president from undertaking a political revival that has put him in position to win back the White House in November. \u201cIt\u2019s axiomatic at this point, but Trump\u2019s continued support, despite the kind of scandal that would have scuttled literally any other previous candidate in American history, is truly astounding,\u201d says Mr Engel. This historic criminal conviction may prove to be different \u2013 particularly if Trump\u2019s appeals fail and he faces the prospect of prison. Or it could just be the latest in a long series of seemingly disruptive events that, in hindsight, have only been bumps on Trump\u2019s path to power.\n\nNew Yorkers react to Trump guilty verdict\n\nAllan Lichtman, a professor at American University, has constructed a political model that has successfully predicted the winner of every presidential race since 1984. He concedes, however, that Trump\u2019s criminal conviction could be the kind of \u201ccataclysmic and unprecedented\u201d twist that throws the model for a loop and changes the course of history. \u201cHistory books will record this as a truly extraordinary, unprecedented event, but a lot will depend on what happens afterwards,\u201d he says. The ultimate judgement on the importance of Trump\u2019s conviction will come at the hands of voters in November. If the former president is defeated, his guilty verdict is likely to be viewed as one of the reasons why. If he wins, it may become just a footnote to Trump\u2019s tumultuous yet consequential political career. \u201cHistory is written by the winners, as we all know,\u201d Mr Engel says.",

        "text": "Elections in Mexico: Beyond 'Deepfakes'\nWhile it is not a novelty, it is an unprecedented phenomenon.\n\nThis year, nearly half of the world\u2019s population will vote in a national election. Globally, the role of technology in the electoral process, especially generative artificial intelligence (AI), and its astonishing ability to create texts, images, audio, and videos that could be considered genuine (deepfakes), has become increasingly impactful and fraught. To some observers, this rapid evolution presents the most formidable electoral challenge of our times.\n\nBut the bag is mixed. The technological revolution creates opportunities and platforms for entertainment, creativity, expression, and intense political debate to flourish. At the same time, it enables manipulation, falsification, and fraud in election results. Both these realities coexist, but they are not necessarily in equilibrium.\n\nThese concurrent realities intensify the political consequences of elections, especially where democracy is fragile to begin with. This is evidenced in the case of Mexico, which is in the midst of a highly contentious and polarizing election season, and which we will explore below.\n\nDIMENSION: Mexico is facing the largest election in its history. It will elect the Presidency of the Republic, Senatorships and Federal Deputies, Governorships, the Head of Government of Mexico City, Local Congresses, Municipal Councils, and Mayoralties. In total, Mexican citizens will cast their votes for more than 19,000 positions.\n\nHowever, except for some specific cases, so far, the campaigns have prevailed in traditional media, public squares, debates, and strategies on known and expected social networks. Thus, the election will be enormous and the run-up coverage is - if one can say so - orthodox.\n\nINSTITUTIONAL WEAKNESS: The National Electoral Institute (INE), the body responsible for organizing the federal elections, is facing turbulent times.\n\nThe INE made possible the election that brought the current president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador (AMLO), to power. Despite this, AMLO has launched an offensive against it, cutting its budget and trying - so far unsuccessfully - to amend the Constitution to annul its autonomy and subjugate it to whims of the national government.\n\nThe Supreme Court (SCJN) \u2013 with significant popular support - prevented these attempts to dismantle the electoral authority through legislative reforms, declaring AMLO\u2019s initiatives unconstitutional for violating the civil and political rights of citizens. Despite this, the administration\u2019s harassment and disparaging of the INE continues.\n\nTo make matters worse, the current management of the Institute - headed by Guadalupe Taddei, appointed by lot due to a lack of consensus in the Chamber of Deputies \u2013 is poor. The electoral authority fails to convey institutional strength or cohesion in the face of the attacks launched at it. On the contrary, perceptions of internal conflict and lack of coordination among its members dominate public opinion. All this undermines the credibility of the INE as an electoral referee.\n\nAs if that were not enough, the electoral courts - federal and local - which are the other strategic components in the electoral institutional arrangement, are also weakened. Mere weeks before the election, the Senate of the Republic has neglected to appoint 44 electoral magistrates both locally and federally.\n\nThis lack of appointments is concerning because it affects a range of bodies responsible for overseeing elections, from the upper chamber of the Federal Electoral Tribunal - which is responsible for the qualification of the presidential election - to its regional and specialized chambers and many of the state tribunals.\n\nThe reason for this dereliction of duty? A lack of responsibility on the part of the senators of the Republic.\n\nPRESIDENTIAL INTERFERENCE: Within this environment of institutional weakness, there is also the inherent inequity in this electoral process, due to the systematic interference of the President through his daily morning conferences for TV in which he attacks political opponents, the media, journalists, and any other person or entity who inconveniences him.\n\nBeyond rhetoric, the other key to understanding the electoral landscape in Mexico is AMLO\u2019s reliance on social programs to buy votes. Offering citizens millions of pesos through direct transfers is an unbeatable electoral strategy. At least, that's what the polls seem to say. Considering this, there is no need for Cambridge Analytica.\n\nORGANIZED CRIME: To top it all off, the criminal violence that plagues communities across Mexico threatens freedoms and imperils political candidates. The government does not want to acknowledge it, but this is the most violent election in the history of Mexico's fragile democracy. Without freedom, with violence and no peace, Mexican democracy languishes.\n\nIt is real violence, not virtual. Pure and hard violence.\n\nThus, contrary to what we could suppose at the beginning of this election, in the most heated and interesting context of the global technological transformation, when generative artificial intelligence evolves and transforms; the main threat to Mexican democracy is not deepfakes but the true facts of institutional incompetence, political irresponsibility, abuse of power, and physical violence.\n\nReal truth.",

        "text": "Absolute criminal immunity for Donald Trump? At the NYU Law Forum, experts weigh in\nOn April 17, eight days before the US Supreme Court heard oral arguments regarding whether former President Donald Trump should enjoy absolute criminal immunity for alleged offenses committed while in office, the NYU Law Forum convened an expert panel to tackle that hot-button issue. The discussion was moderated by Professor of Practice Andrew Weissmann, who served as a lead prosecutor in Robert Mueller\u2019s Special Counsel\u2019s Office during Mueller\u2019s investigation into allegations of a conspiracy between the Russian government and Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nAndrew Weissmann, George Conway, Kate Shaw, and Trevor Morrison\n\nThe panelists traced the legal basis for presidential civil immunity, expressed in the 1982 Supreme Court case Nixon v. Fitzgerald, in which a former Air Force contractor sued former President Richard Nixon for allegedly costing him his job. The participants then touched on topics including the specifics of the arguments for and against presidential criminal immunity, and how the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in the Trump case could affect his federal trial on charges that he conspired to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. They also contemplated the chances of a trial date before the 2024 election, when voters will once again decide whether to return Trump to the Oval Office.\n\nSelected remarks from the NYU Law Forum discussion:\n\nGeorge Conway, contributing writer for The Atlantic and former partner at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz: \u201cThe Supreme Court ruled by only a 5-4 margin in favor of then-President Nixon [in Nixon v. Fitzgerald]. It went through all these civil liability cases [against past presidents] and distilled from those cases, basically, a principle that it kind of beefed up for the president. And the rationale was, well, the president does things that affect a lot of people\u2026and if you say that somebody out there [was] harmed by his alleged\u2026failure to comply with the law and you say that he\u2019s personally liable, what president is going to be able to do his job? And from that they basically derived the standard for presidential civil immunity for conduct allegedly violative of the law and harming a civil plaintiff. And the standard is that if the conduct that is alleged is within the\u2014and here are the magic words\u2014\u2018outer perimeter\u2019 of the president\u2019s official responsibilities, then there can be no claim.\u201d (video 05:13)\n\nKate Shaw, professor of law at University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School and co-host of the Strict Scrutiny podcast: \u201cWhat Trump is asking for is an unprecedented extension or expansion of the absolute immunity rule of Fitzgerald to the criminal context, which is something no court has ever accepted. And I think everything in our history and constitutional structure and discussions\u2014such as they are\u2014in the cases and executive branch practice and things that Congress has said, all of that seems very clearly to render the argument that Fitzgerald should just apply wholesale, create absolute immunity from criminal liability for former presidents forever, is totally indefensible.\u201d (video 09:39)\n\nTrevor Morrison, Eric M. and Laurie B. Roth Professor of Law and dean emeritus: \u201cTrump\u2019s litigation strategy is to tell the Supreme Court, \u2018Unless you find me immune in this case, you will have no ability to protect presidents from criminal prosecution when they act in core fulfillment of their constitutional responsibilities.\u2019 He\u2019s saying it\u2019s all or nothing, and it isn\u2019t all or nothing\u2026. The point [of Special Counsel Jack Smith\u2019s brief] is, I think, to convince the members of the Court who are concerned about the legitimate prerogatives of the executive branch that those prerogatives can be protected without having to distort immunity doctrine to cover what Trump is alleged to have done in this case.\u201d (video 25:44)\n\nWatch the discussion on video:\n\nPosted May 30, 2024",

        "text": "CBS News poll finds Biden-Trump race tight in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin\nFor years, they've been three of the handful of states that decided presidential elections. In the summer of 2020, amid the COVID pandemic and lockdown debates, sizable majorities in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania rated state economies badly. Incumbent President Donald Trump trailed in polls, and ultimately, the three close contests were won by challenger Joe Biden.\n\nFour years on, some things haven't changed. We have the same two candidates locked in close \u2014 effectively even \u2014 races. And there are still negative views of the economy that now, as then, weigh on the 2024 incumbent, President Biden.\n\nGiven the views of these candidates, the summer campaign here might be an argument about who is the less bad option: both candidates elicit more feelings of worry than confidence, more insecurity than security, and plenty of anger.\n\nWith inflation looming large in their minds, most voters don't say there's even been improvement in their state's economy post-pandemic: only a quarter say it has improved in the years since, with about half saying it has actually gotten worse.\n\nAnd few say their own finances are better compared to before the pandemic. This may be an essential part of their memory \u2014 comparing to before the coronavirus.\n\nAmid those poor economic numbers, here's a change that's working against Mr. Biden: he narrowly trails Donald Trump on \"understands the needs and concerns of people like you.\" That means he's losing an edge he enjoyed in the summer of 2020 when we asked voters in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin this question.\n\nThe choice between Mr. Biden and Trump now predominantly draws out negative feelings like worry and anger.\n\nTwice as many say Mr. Biden makes them feel worried as say he makes them feel either secure or confident. He trails Trump on making voters feel confident and secure.\n\nTrump, for his part, elicits more feelings of anger, which does fuel opposition to him, helping keep Mr. Biden in these races, despite sour economic views.\n\nAnother change is that voters are less likely to see Mr. Biden as \"moderate\" now than they were in 2020, blunting another item that worked to his advantage four years ago. The percentage of self-described moderates who see Biden as a moderate has decreased.\n\nFinances and the economy\n\nAs we've seen nationwide, voters today recall their state's economy \"when Donald Trump was president\" quite differently from the way it was viewed back in 2020, specifically. Ratings of the economy were quite low that year. So it may well be that when they think back about the Trump years, they're thinking back to before the pandemic. That matters a lot for how they perceive their choice of Trump and Mr. Biden now.\n\nThinking in retrospect about the economy under Trump while skipping over the pandemic in 2020 lends itself to a more favorable comparison with the economy now, under Mr. Biden. Moreover, many voters say their own finances today are worse than during the time before the pandemic.\n\nAnd so, today we find plenty of voters want to change back: in all three states, many believe they would be financially better off with Trump back in office. Voters who feel this way are voting for him in large numbers.\n\nMr. Biden's perceived advantage on helping the middle class instead of the wealthy, at least relative to Trump, has taken a hit in Pennsylvania since the fall of 2020. That fall, voters felt Mr. Biden's policies would be less likely than Trump's to favor the wealthy. That's still the case, but today, the gap between the two candidates has narrowed.\n\nDefining the stakes\n\nSo, given all that economic pessimism, what keeps Biden even?\n\nFirst, there are other issues.\n\nThere's an ongoing battle between the campaigns to define the stakes of the election this year. The Biden camp is pressing perceived risks to democracy, including infringements on rights, while the Trump campaign is hammering the incumbent on the economy.\n\nMany rank both economy and democracy as important because it's not an either-or-choice, but more rate the economy and inflation as major factors, compared to the state of democracy.\n\nThat advantages Trump, partly because he does a little better among those prioritizing the economy than Mr. Biden does with voters ranking democracy highly.\n\nAbortion\n\nIt may be a state issue on policy, but it's national politically \u2014 especially for Democrats \u2014 and it does accrue to their advantage.\n\nSizable numbers in these states express anger about Roe v. Wade being overturned \u2014 most of them blame Trump for it, and they're overwhelmingly backing Mr. Biden.\n\nMost voters in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan report paying attention to events in other states like Florida and Arizona, so what individual states do has some national resonance.\n\nThat said, the race is more competitive among voters who are dissatisfied but not angry about the Dobbs decision that overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\nThese are voters to watch in the coming months. They could become potential persuasion targets for the Biden campaign, because most of them do favor abortion being legal in their state but don't blame Trump for the overturning of Roe. The question will be whether they increase in anger, in blame of Trump, or in the salience of the issue overall.\n\nOverall, abortion is still not as salient across the whole electorate as economic concerns. It trails far behind the economy and inflation, among other factors in each state.\n\nAnd how people feel about the financial impact of the next president is more closely related to their vote than whether they want abortion to be legal or not.\n\nTrump's trial: not much of a factor\n\nTrump's trial in New York isn't much of a factor at the moment because it's mostly Democrats and Biden voters who are paying attention, in the form of hearing or reading a lot about it.\n\nAnd even among Trump voters, the ones already strong in their support of him \u2014 and therefore, unlikely to be moved by much \u2014 are the ones who report paying more attention than do his less-committed supporters.\n\nOverall, voters are equally likely to be concerned that the charges are politically motivated as they are that Trump committed a crime.\n\nBreaking down vote patterns\n\nHere's another notable change from 2020, and it's within each candidate's support set, perhaps reflecting voter displeasure with having this rematch:\n\nEach candidate's \"very strong\" support number among backers is lower than it was in 2020 even though, at the same time, very few of them say they would ever consider switching candidates.\n\nSo, with this kind of dynamic, it would not be surprising to see lower turnout rates or even higher third-party voting than the last election saw.\n\nBiden and young voters\n\nThere's been a lot of discussion about Mr. Biden's slipping approval among younger voters and about his handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict. However, approving is not the same as voting. One is an evaluation, the other, a choice.\n\nThe young voters who want Mr. Biden to tell Israel to stop its military actions in Gaza are still voting for him, at about the same rate as younger voters overall. That said, expressed vote choice now isn't the same as turning out in November, and as a group, young voters aren't as likely to say they will.\n\nA Biden administration proposal that is popular with younger voters is canceling some student loan debt. Solid majorities of voters under 45 approve, and those who do are backing Mr. Biden in large numbers. And if they aren't backing him, those who approve of the plan are more likely to say they would consider voting for him.\n\nThird-party tests\n\nIn political polling, third-party measures can mean a lot of things. Sometimes they're genuine support, sometimes they're a way to voice a protest early in a cycle. Third-party candidates have tended to poll better than they perform at the ballot box in recent years, as some voters dissatisfied with major-party nominees simply don't show up to vote at all. Either way, it'll certainly be a story to watch in 2024 in states where such candidates are on the ballot.\n\nIn Michigan, with the presence of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. the net gap between Mr. Biden and Trump is the same, but Kennedy looks like he's drawing more interest from the kinds of voters backing Trump than backing Mr. Biden.\n\nMost of those picking Kennedy in a four-way ballot test backed Trump initially in a two-way race with Mr. Biden, including leaners.\n\nKennedy's supporters look more like Republicans than Democrats on a variety of measures, including their views on the economy, immigrants, and Trump's trial, as well as how they voted recently, despite the fact that they often identify as moderates. (That can mean they just don't feel at home in the usual political labels.)\n\nAnd eight in 10 say Mr. Biden makes them feel worried, while only half say so of Trump.\n\nIt's important to consider who picks each candidate, not just where the horse race ends up, when looking at the impact going forward in a campaign.\n\nThese CBS News/YouGov surveys were conducted between April 19-25, 2024. They are based on representative samples of 1,287 registered voters in Michigan, 1,306 in Pennsylvania, and 1,245 in Wisconsin. Margins of error for registered voters: Michigan +/- 3.1 points, Pennsylvania +/- 3.1 points, and Wisconsin +/- 3.2 points.\n\nMichigan toplines\n\nPennsylvania toplines\n\nWisconsin toplines",

        "text": "How Will Mexico\u2019s First Female President Transform the US-Mexico Bilateral Ties?\nOn Sunday, June 2nd, Mexico will be electing its first female President in what will be a historic election positioned for a victory for gender equality in the North American region. This year, as it happens every 12 years, Mexico\u2019s transformative election coincides with the one in the United States. The outcomes of June 2nd and November 5th will determine the bilateral relationship between these neighbors.\n\nMexico is a country where women have long suffered systemic violence, inequality, and cultural barriers so it might seem contradictory that Claudia Sheinbaum and X\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez are the leading presidential candidates. While having a woman at the highest political level certainly sends a powerful message to the women and girls across the country inspiring new possibilities for their futures, it is their policy proposals, and their implementation, that will determine its impact on gender equality. For the United States, this milestone could serve as a catalyst for a renewed focus on the bilateral cooperation for gender equality and its internal battles for reproductive rights and gender diversity.\n\nRepresentation matters but having a female President does not automatically imply that a feminist domestic agenda or a feminist foreign policy will be implemented. However, it does imply that they will face certain challenges based on their gender. According to Kate Manne , \u201cfemale candidates were also held to be less qualified than male candidates with similar credentials\u201d, in a world where 13 out of 193 countries have a woman head of state, Mexico\u2019s upcoming president will be facing an added challenge at global forums and in its international relations.\n\nIn terms of the US-Mexico relations, a major negotiation will be coming up in 2026, with the first mandatory review of the USMCA trade agreement. In 2023, Mexico became the US's top trading partner totaling almost $800 billion. Both Sheinbaum and G\u00e1lvez's platforms emphasize Mexico's economic competitiveness but they have different views on the USMCA.\n\nThe candidate from the Morena party will prioritize migration and agriculture , two issues that have different effects for women and men. Sheinbaum\u2019s proposal includes the recognition of the agricultural rights of 150,000 women. While G\u00e1lvez will strive to secure access to lands for indigenous women, the most pressing issue for the opposition candidate would be the role of China , which former President Trump has also mentioned as part of his priorities. The development of commercial and economic cooperation will also depend on the priorities that will be determined from whoever will be leading both Palacio Nacional and the Oval Office.\n\nHistorically, US-Mexico relations have been shaped by the personal rapport between their leaders, having periods of tension and cooperation. Claudia Sheinbaum\u2019s progressive policies and strong emphasis on social welfare, environmental sustainability, and inclusivity would align with President Biden's climate agenda, which could lead to a bilateral environmental cooperation. Having joint initiatives and a strong environmental partnership would also have a positive impact on marginalized communities and women given that they face a disproportionate impact of the effects of climate change. However, having a female president is not enough to guarantee a gender perspective, gender mainstreaming in their cabinets and policies would be required to introduce innovative approaches to the persistent gender issues.\n\nOne thing is clear, Mexico\u2019s first female president will nudge the US electorate to reflect on the benefits of diverse leadership and it could influence the political discourse in the US, encouraging a more inclusive approach and to policy formulation. It will serve as a reminder of the importance of having a more equitable and cooperative world.",

        "text": "How Trump's conviction could change the dynamics of the 2024 race\nFormer President Donald Trump has been found guilty of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in his Manhattan criminal trial, adding another layer of uncertainty to an already unprecedented campaign.\n\nAs a convicted felon, Trump is not prevented from continuing to campaign for president, since the Constitution does not prohibit candidates from running for president even if they are convicted of a crime. In fact, there is precedent for a candidate running from behind bars: In 1920, Socialist Party candidate Eugene V. Debs ran for president from a federal penitentiary in Atlanta.\n\nTrump is the first former U.S. president to be found guilty of felonies, and the first major party candidate to run for office after being found guilty of a crime. Here's how his conviction could change the 2024 campaign:\n\nHow Trump can campaign after his conviction\n\nNow that he's convicted, Trump is all but certain to appeal the decision handed down by the jury, and he is likely to be able to return to the campaign trail as the process plays out.\n\nThe next development in the case will come at sentencing, currently scheduled for July 11. Justice Juan Merchan has wide discretion over when sentencing occurs and what the punishment looks like. Trump faces a maximum of up to four years in prison and a $5,000 fine for each of the 34 felony charges of falsification of business records. The sentencing options available to Merchan include prison, probation, conditional discharge, fines or house arrest.\n\nThe judge could put limitations on his travel, such as restricting Trump from leaving the state and taking his passport, but Merchan has said he doesn't want to interfere with his ability to campaign.\n\n\"I would think that the judge wouldn't dare interfere with his right to speak to the American public because it's the right of the voters to be informed as well,\" said John Coffee, a professor at Columbia Law School and an expert on corporate governance and white collar crime.\n\nIn a recent survey of dozens of cases brought by Manhattan District Attorney's Office in which falsifying business records was the most serious charge at arraignment, attorney and author Norm Eisen found that roughly one in 10 of those cases resulted in a sentence of incarceration.\n\n\"I think that is fascinating,\" said Caroline Polisi, a criminal defense attorney and professor at Columbia Law School. \"A lot of commentators say the reason he won't be incarcerated is because the logistics of it with respect to the Secret Service would be too much. On the other hand, if you're saying he should be treated like any other defendant, we have a lot of data saying that 90% of other defendants would not get jail time in this situation.\"\n\nThe impact of the conviction on Trump's ability to campaign could largely hinge on what sentence Merchan ultimately hands down, and when Trump would serve it.\n\n\"In the context in which he is found guilty and then sentenced to no jail time, I don't think it's going to cause a bit of difference,\" added Polisi. \"There might be some minor issues. He might not be able to vote for himself. But other than that, I don't think it's going to cause any problems.\"\n\nWhen determining Trump's sentence, the judge could take into account his numerous gag order violations \u2014 which led Merchan to threaten him with jail time if the violations continued \u2014 and his lack of demonstrated remorse or respect for the legal system. Throughout the trial, Trump referred to Merchan as \"conflicted\" and \"corrupt\" and to the case itself as a \"sham.\"\n\n\"In New York, a 78-year-old defendant, who's a first time offender, committed a non-violent offense, and has an otherwise, well, distinguished record \u2014 in some regards being an ex-president is distinguished. In that kind of world, there'd be no chance of an incarceration sentence,\" said Coffee. Trump turns 78 on June 14. \"They can use probation, they can use fines. But there may be a view of many judges that you have to show that no one's above the law, and even the future president should have a taste of prison.\"\n\nEven if Merchan does order Trump to serve time behind bars, the sentence could be deferred until his appeal has run its course.\n\n\"In other cases, when you don't have someone running for the White House, it would be more or acceptable to put him immediately into incarceration,\" said Coffee. \"You certainly could put special conditions on what he could do or put him under house arrest, but I think until we get to the actual election, we're going to have to let Donald Trump run around and campaign.\"\n\nThe conviction's possible impact on Trump's poll numbers and support\n\nTrump has predicted that a conviction in this trial could boost his poll numbers.\n\n\"Even if convicted, I think that it has absolutely no impact. It may drive the numbers up, but we don't want that. We want to have a fair verdict,\" Trump told CBS Pittsburgh in an interview earlier this month.\n\nTrump's support among his Republican base has been remarkably resilient in the face of his various criminal cases. In the months following his four indictments last year, Trump maintained his commanding lead in the Republican primary, capturing the nomination despite the dozens of criminal charges he faced.\n\nMany Trump supporters who CBS News has interviewed since the trial began have said a guilty conviction will not change how they vote in November, adopting the former president's grievances as their own.\n\n\"Stormy Daniels has already been reviewed and stuff. It's kind of coincidental,\" Michigan resident Lori Beyer said at a recent rally in Freeland, Michigan, adding she would vote for Trump regardless of the conviction. \"I don't think it's going to impact it, as far as I'm concerned.\"\n\nWhether a conviction changes the minds of voters who are not committed to the former president remains to be seen. A recent CBS News poll found that the majority of Americans believed Trump is \"definitely or probably\" guilty of the charges he faced in New York. The overwhelming majority of Democrats \u2014 93% \u2014 believed Trump was guilty, while 78% Republicans said he was not. Independents were split, with 53% believing he was guilty and 47% saying he wasn't.\n\nOpinions about whether Trump was guilty or not were already highly partisan, according to Kabir Khanna, deputy director of elections and data analytics for CBS News. Most people who believed Trump was guilty also thought the jury would convict him, and vice versa.\n\nAdditionally, Khanna said people who followed the trial closely were the most polarized in their views.\n\n\"Together, these factors could blunt the impact of the verdict on the views of an already divided public,\" Khanna said. \"Some voters may be swayed by the news, but I wouldn't expect a sea change.\"\n\nOther polling supports that notion. A NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist survey released Thursday found that 67% of registered voters nationwide said a Trump conviction would not make a difference in how they vote. Among independents, just 11% said a guilty verdict would make them less likely to vote for Trump.\n\nThe conviction also gives the Biden campaign a potentially potent new weapon in their arsenal: the ability to label Trump a convicted felon. Mr. Biden remained largely silent about the Trump trial while it was ongoing, but NBC News reported last week that he planned to become more aggressive about Trump's legal woes after the trial concluded, while acknowledging that Trump would be on the ballot regardless of how his legal cases played out.\n\nTrump has used the trial to help boost his fundraising, and will likely look to capitalize on the conviction. The Trump campaign and Republican National Committee saw an influx of donations after jury selection began, with the two entities raising $76 million in April. His campaign had about $50 million cash on hand at the beginning of May as he prepared to get back out on the campaign trail after the trial.\n\nThe former president repeatedly used the developments in the trial to raise money, including when he was held in contempt for violating the gag order against him.\n\n\"I'd get arrested ONE MILLION TIMES before I'd let those filthy dogs get their hands on you,\" one typical fundraising appeal read.\n\nTrump's other criminal cases\n\nThe New York case might be the only one of Trump's four criminal prosecutions to reach a conclusion before voters cast their ballots in the fall, giving the guilty verdict added weight.\n\nThe two federal cases brought by special counsel Jack Smith remain in limbo.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., Trump faces charges related to his actions to remain in power after the 2016 election. Trump has argued that he is immune from prosecution, and the Supreme Court is currently weighing his claim.\n\nThe high court heard arguments in the immunity dispute on April 26 and is expected to issue a decision on the matter before the end of the court's term, likely in June. If the case is allowed to move forward, there is a slim possibility that the district court could schedule the trial before November. If the justices side with Trump and find him immune from prosecution, the charges would be dropped.\n\nIn Florida, Trump faces federal charges stemming from his retention of classified documents after he left the White House. Judge Aileen Cannon, who was appointed by Trump, has indefinitely postponed the trial. She ruled in early May that picking a trial date would be \"imprudent and inconsistent with the court's duty to fully and fairly consider\" numerous unresolved pre-trial motions. Those motions include Trump's efforts to dismiss the case altogether, as well as issues related to what classified information can be revealed at trial.\n\nIn the third case that remains outstanding, Trump faces state charges related to the 2020 election in Fulton County, Georgia. The trial in that matter is also on hold as Trump seeks to have District Attorney Fani Willis removed from the case. Georgia's Court of Appeals recently granted Trump's appeal of a decision that had allowed her to remain, bringing the trial to a temporary halt.\n\nTrump's two federal cases could largely be in voters' hands if they are not resolved by November, a fact that raises his personal stake in the outcome. If he wins and returns to the White House in January 2025, Trump could order the Justice Department to seek to drop the charges altogether.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty in all of the criminal cases against him.",

Trump has become the first U.S. president to be convicted of a felony. In a historic decision, a 12-person Manhattan jury found the former president guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business records in an effort to disguise a hush money payment made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election.\n\nTrump is also the first major party candidate \u2014 and the 2024 presumptive Republican presidential nominee \u2014 to run for president as a felon.\n\nHere\u2019s what the guilty verdict means for Trump:\n\nWhat could Trump\u2019s punishment be?\n\nJudge Juan Merchan scheduled Trump\u2019s sentencing for July 11 at 10 a.m. ET when he\u2019ll decide whether the former president\u2019s punishment will include prison time.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nNewsletter: The Yodel Trusted news and daily delights, right in your inbox See for yourself \u2014 The Yodel is the go-to source for daily news, entertainment and feel-good stories. Sign up By signing up, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Policy.\n\nTrump was convicted on 34 counts, which means he could face a maximum of four years in prison for each count, totaling a maximum prison sentence of 136 years. But New York state caps prison sentences at 20 years for this type of offense.\n\nIf the judge decides to issue prison time for more than one conviction, Merchan will also have to decide if Trump\u2019s sentence will run concurrently or consecutively, one after another.\n\nLegal experts say it\u2019s unlikely that Trump would face jail time because Trump does not have a criminal record and the charges against him are nonviolent felonies.\n\nMerchan could impose other punishments instead of prison time, such as probation. Trump would have to report to the New York City Department of Probation in person on a regular basis, which would create a major scheduling snafu for the GOP presidential candidate on the campaign trail. If Trump committed other crimes under probation, he could be sent immediately to jail.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nTrump\u2019s conviction also means the charges against him are punishable by up to $5,000 per offense; if Judge Merchan decides to go that route, Trump could face up to $170,000 in fines.\n\nMerchan could also issue a conditional discharge. In such a scenario, Trump would be free and not require probation supervision as long as he doesn\u2019t get into additional trouble.\n\nCan Trump run for president and serve in the White House as a convicted felon?\n\nYes. A guilty felony conviction doesn\u2019t prevent Trump from running for president. Under Article II of the U.S. Constitution, there are only three qualifications that need to be met for the office of the presidency: The person must be at least 35 years old, be a natural-born citizen and have lived in the U.S. for at least 14 years.\n\nIt would be a different story if Trump were charged with crimes of an insurrection under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment; such an offense would disqualify him from holding public office if found guilty.\n\nCould Trump pardon himself in this case if he\u2019s elected president?\n\nNo, he could not pardon himself in this New York case or in his Georgia election interference case. The powers of the presidential pardon don\u2019t extend to state crimes and the president of the United States can only pardon federal crimes, according to Article II, Section 2, of the Constitution.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIn the Manhattan hush money case, only New York Gov. Kathy Hochul could pardon him. That would be highly unlikely given that she is a Democrat.\n\nCan Trump vote for himself in the November election?\n\nTrump is registered to vote in Florida. Convicted felons can only vote in the state after they have completed their sentence, which could be prison time or paying a fine. However, Florida also honors the voting laws in the state where the felony conviction occurred, which in this case is New York. In New York state, convicted felons are not allowed to vote only when they are imprisoned.\n\nSo unless Trump is behind bars on Election Day, which is unlikely, then he\u2019ll probably be able to vote for himself.\n\nCan Trump appeal the convictions?\n\nYes, and Trump\u2019s legal team plans to appeal the guilty convictions. Trump attorney Todd Blanche said on CNN Thursday evening that the appeal of the convictions would be filed \u201cas soon as we can.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAfter Trump's sentencing in July, his defense team will have 30 days to file a notice of appeal, and then they\u2019ll have six months to file the appeal.\n\nAnother Trump attorney, Will Scharf, told Fox News that the former president\u2019s legal team is \u201cconsidering all options\u201d for an appeal. \u201cThis case is replete with reversible error going back to the very first day, continuing through jury instructions,\" Scharf said. \"Every aspect of this case is ripe for appeal. We are going to appeal as quickly as we can. We will seek expedited review of this case.\u201d\n\nWhen they do, it remains to be seen if Merchan orders a stay in Trump\u2019s sentence, or puts a pause on it, until the appeals process plays out, which could go beyond Election Day.\n\nWhat about Trump\u2019s gag order?\n\nJudge Merchan issued a gag order on Trump before the trial began on March 26 that barred him, or directing others, from publicly speaking about jurors, trial witnesses, lawyers and aides, court staffers and family members of the previously mentioned people.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe gag order doesn\u2019t prevent Trump from making statements about Judge Merchan or Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, whose office brought the case.\n\nMerchan added a provision to the gag order on April 1 that barred Trump from talking about Merchan and Bragg\u2019s family members.\n\nTrump had violated the gag order 10 times during the trial and was forced to pay a total of $10,000 in fines. It remains to be seen when the gag order will be lifted.\n\nWhat about Trump\u2019s other legal troubles?\n\nThe former president is facing three other criminal cases, which are unlikely to go to trial before Election Day.\n\nGeorgia election interference case: Last August, state prosecutors brought charges against Trump and 18 of his allies for their alleged efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election in the state of Georgia. The case is currently caught up in appeals regarding District Attorney Fani Willis being allowed to stay on the case and six counts against Trump being thrown out. A trial date hasn\u2019t been set.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nFederal election interference: Last August, special prosecutor Jack Smith charged Trump with four criminal counts over his alleged efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election after he lost. This case is on hold until the Supreme Court rules on whether Trump can claim presidential immunity in the case.\n\nFederal classified documents case: In a separate case, Smith brought charges against Trump for allegedly mishandling classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla., after he left the White House. The case was scheduled to go to trial in federal court in Florida, but U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon said the trial was indefinitely postponed due to ongoing legal issues.",

        "text": "Mexico election: US closely watches as neighbour votes\nMigrants and drugs - why Mexico's election matters to the US\n\nReuters Claudia Sheinbaum (left) and X\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez are the main contenders in Sunday's presidential election\n\nMexico's upcoming presidential election has already attracted a lot of media attention due to the fact that it is expected to deliver the country\u2019s first female head of state. Opinion polls have given the frontrunner, Claudia Sheinbaum, and her main rival, X\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez, such a large lead over their male rivals, that a female president looks like a foregone conclusion. But whoever wins this coming Sunday will have to deal with the sensitive relationship with the United States, which is not only Mexico\u2019s northern neighbour but also its top commercial partner. How to handle the Mexican drug cartels \u2013 largely blamed by US authorities for the deadly epidemic of fentanyl overdoses and deaths in the US \u2013 is not the only daunting issue for the Mexican presidential candidates. The winner will also have to deal with the record flows through Mexico of US-bound foreign migrants that are a burning topic in the US\u2019 own 2024 electoral race.\n\nEPA Migrants have arrived in record numbers at the Mexico-US border during the past years\n\nThe scenario is complicated by the possibility of the return to the US presidency of Donald Trump, whose strident positions on migrants and drugs have raised eyebrows south of the border. Mr Trump has vowed to carry out the \"largest deportation operation\" in US history to remove undocumented migrants already in the country if he returns to the White House. Some Mexican media commentators are calling a possible second Trump presidency \"the elephant in the room\" for Mexico's presidential hopefuls. Both Ms Sheinbaum and Ms G\u00e1lvez have emphasised the importance of Mexico's relationship with the US, and they have both pledged to broadly pursue good bilateral cooperation. Ms Sheinbaum, who is running for the governing Morena party, has vowed to continue with \"pride\" the foreign policy of her mentor, outgoing President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador. Relations between the US and Mexico during the six years Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador has been in power have not been without tension, with disagreements flaring over US counter-narcotics operations inside Mexico, as well as over measures taken by the US on its border to try to control migrants.\n\nEPA How to tackle the issues of migration and drug cartels has sometimes led to friction\n\nOpposition contender X\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez has called the outgoing government's foreign policy a \"disaster\". But like Ms Sheinbaum, she has also taken a strongly pro-migrant stance, particularly with respect to Mexican migrants in the US. Aware that nationalist pride plays strongly in Mexico, both candidates made a point in a recent presidential debate of stressing that their governments would not let themselves be cowed or bullied by the US, especially over migration. Ms Sheinbaum declared that there would be \"no more submission in foreign policy\", saying that centre-right predecessors of Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador had allowed themselves to be \"humiliated\" by the US. \"Coordination yes, subordination no,\" she said, summarising her vision of relations with the US back in March. \u201cWe will always tell them [the US] it\u2019s better to build bridges rather than walls,\" she added a few weeks later. Opposition contender X\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez has also pledged a \u201cfrank, direct and clear\u201d relationship with the US, which she has recognised as \"our most important market\".\n\nEPA X\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez has said she is not afraid to stand up to US presidents",

        "text": "Can Trump run for president as a convicted felon?\nCan Trump run for president as a convicted felon?\n\nWatch: Donald Trump calls trial 'a disgrace' after guilty verdict\n\nThirty-four charges, one often exasperated judge and a parade of witnesses. After two days of deliberations, 12 New Yorkers found Donald Trump guilty of all charges in his hush-money case. It is a history-making verdict following a history-making trial. Trump is now the first former US president with a criminal conviction, and the first major party candidate to run for the White House as a felon. So what happens next? Here are some key issues to consider. LIVE UPDATES: Reaction and analysis\n\nCan he still run for president?\n\nYes. The US Constitution sets out relatively few eligibility requirements for presidential candidates: they must be at least 35, be a \u201cnatural born\u201d US citizen and have lived in the US for at least 14 years. There are no rules blocking candidates with criminal records. But this guilty verdict still could sway November\u2019s presidential election. A poll from Bloomberg and Morning Consult earlier this year found that 53% of voters in key swing states would refuse to vote for the Republican if he were convicted. Another poll, from Quinnipiac University this month, showed 6% of Trump voters would be less likely to vote for him - consequential in such a tight race.\n\nWhat happens to Trump now?\n\nTrump has been free on bail throughout the trial and this did not change after the verdict was read on Thursday - the Republican was released on his own recognisance. He will return to court on 11 July - the date Justice Juan Merchan has scheduled for a sentencing hearing. But Trump said Friday his team will ask Justice Merchan for a different day, as the selected date is four days before the start of the Republican National Convention. Regardless of the date, the judge will have several factors to consider in sentencing, including Trump\u2019s age. The sentence could involve a fine, probation or supervision, or possibly prison time.\n\nGetty Images Trump's team may use Stormy Daniels' testimony as grounds for appeal\n\nTrump, who called the ruling a \"disgrace\", said he will appeal the guilty verdict, a process that could take months or even longer. Attorney Todd Blanche told CNN Thursday night that the former president's legal team would \"vigorously fight\" the verdict with motions in the coming weeks. If those motions prove unsuccessful, they will appeal following his sentencing, Mr Blanche said. His legal team would face the Appellate Division in Manhattan, and possibly the Court of Appeals. This all means that even after sentencing it would be highly unlikely that Trump will leave the court in handcuffs, as he would be expected to remain free on bail while he appeals.\n\nWhat would be the grounds for appeal?\n\nThe evidence of adult film star Stormy Daniels, whose alleged sexual encounter with Trump was at the heart of the case, could be one reason. \u201cThe level of detail that was provided [by Ms Daniels] is really not necessary to the telling of the story,\" said Anna Cominsky, a professor at New York Law School. \"On the one hand, her detail makes her credible and as a prosecutor, you want to provide enough detail so the jury believes what she has to say. On the other hand, there's a line, where it could become irrelevant and prejudicial.\" Trump\u2019s defence team twice called for a mistrial during Ms Daniels\u2019 testimony, motions that were denied by the judge. 'The air in the courtroom turned to stone' Beyond that, the novel legal strategy taken by the District Attorney in this case may also provide grounds for appeal. Falsifying business records can be a lower-level misdemeanour in New York, but Trump faced more serious felony charges because of a supposed second crime, an alleged illegal attempt to influence the 2016 election. Prosecutors broadly alleged that violations of federal and state election laws, along with tax fraud, applied to this case. But they did not specify to the jury exactly which one was broken. Legal experts say there are questions around the scope and application of the federal law that could form a basis for appeal. Never before has a state prosecutor invoked an uncharged federal crime, and there\u2019s a question if the Manhattan District Attorney had the jurisdiction to do so.\n\nCan Trump go to prison?\n\nIt is possible, though highly unlikely, that Trump will serve time behind bars. The 34 charges he faced are all class E felonies in New York, the lowest tier in the state. Each charge carries a maximum sentence of four years. As noted above, there are several reasons why Justice Merchan could choose a lesser punishment, including Trump\u2019s age, his lack of previous convictions, and the fact that the charges involve a non-violent crime. He could consider Trump's violations of the court\u2019s gag orders during the trial. It is also possible that the judge would weigh the unprecedented nature of the case, perhaps choosing to avoid putting a former president and current candidate behind bars.\n\nGetty Images Most observers say it is unlikely Mr Trump will receive a prison sentence\n\nThere is also a question of practicality. Trump, like all former presidents, is entitled to lifelong protection from the Secret Service. This means that some agents would need to protect him in prison. Even so, it would be extremely difficult to run a prison system with a former president as an inmate. It would be a huge security risk and expensive to keep him safe. \u201cPrison systems care about two things: security of the institution and keeping costs down,\u201d said Justin Paperny, director of the prison consulting firm White Collar Advice. With Trump, \u201cit would be a freak show\u2026 no warden would allow it\u201d, he said.\n\nCan he vote?\n\nIt's likely that Trump will be able to vote this autumn. Under Florida law - where Trump is a resident - a person with a felony conviction from another state is ineligible to vote only \"if the conviction would make the person ineligible to vote in the state where the person was convicted\". Trump was convicted in New York, where felons are allowed to vote as long as they are not currently incarcerated. This means that unless Trump is behind bars on 5 November, he should be eligible to cast his ballot.\n\nCould he pardon himself?\n\nNo. Presidents can issue pardons for those who have committed federal offences. The hush-money case in New York is a state matter, meaning it would be out of Trump\u2019s reach if he were to become president again. The same is true for Trump\u2019s case in Georgia, where he has been accused of criminally conspiring to overturn his narrow defeat by President Joe Biden in the state during the 2020 election. This case is currently tied up in appeals. Pardon powers are unclear for Trump\u2019s two federal cases - one concerning the alleged mishandling of classified documents, and the other on conspiring to overturn the 2020 election. In the first, a Trump-appointed judge in Florida has indefinitely postponed the trial, saying setting a date before resolving questions about evidence would be \u201cimprudent\u201d. The second outstanding federal case also was delayed while an appeal from Trump plays out. Neither are likely to take place before the November election, but even if they did, constitutional scholars disagree on whether a president\u2019s pardon power includes himself. Trump could be the first to try.",

        "text": "Can Trump still vote after being convicted?\nCould Trump go to prison? Can he still be president? What to know after verdict\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the presumptive GOP nominee for the presidency in November, is now a convicted felon, but it's still likely he can vote \u2014 and vote for himself \u2014 in Florida this fall.\n\nTrump, whose primary residence was in New York for most of his life, moved his residency to Florida in 2019, so that's where he would seek to vote this fall. Trump can still become president as a convicted felon, and experts say despite his conviction on 34 felony counts on Thursday, he can likely vote, too. Trump's sentencing hearing is scheduled for July, but his attorneys are sure to file all appeals possible, and it's not yet clear whether he will serve prison time.\n\nBlair Bowie, an attorney at the Campaign Legal Center, said Florida \"defers to other state laws when it comes to disenfranchising voters who are tried and convicted elsewhere.\"\n\nAccording to Florida state law, a Florida resident with a felony conviction elsewhere is only ineligible to vote \"if the conviction would make the person ineligible to vote in the state where the person was convicted,\" the Florida Division of Elections website says. According to the New York courts website, \"you lose your right to vote while you are in prison for a felony conviction.\" But \"if you are convicted of a felony and you are released from prison, you can vote,\" and \"if you are convicted of a felony and your sentence is suspended, you can vote.\"\n\nIn a social media post Friday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis wrote that \"Trump hasn't lost his voting rights in Florida. Rights are not removed in Florida where they haven't yet been stripped in the convicting jurisdiction.\"\n\nThe ACLU of New York says convicted felons who are on parole, on probation, were not sentenced to prison or completed a prison sentence can vote.\n\n\"New York only disenfranchises people while serving a prison sentence, so assuming Trump is not sentenced to prison time, his rights would be restored by New York law and therefore also in Florida,\" Bowie said.\n\nCBS News legal analyst and Loyola University Law School professor Jessica Levinson agreed, saying a person convicted of a felony can vote unless incarcerated.\n\n\"New York says you can vote unless he's incarcerated, so no incarceration means he can vote,\" Levinson said.\n\nTrump is still facing charges related to alleged election interference in Georgia and Washington, D.C, and another 40 counts related to the classified documents case in Florida. None of those cases have trial dates set yet.",

The \"United States can do more,\" she has argued.\n\nMs G\u00e1lvez too has listed \"protection of migrants\" among her priorities, including a call for the \"regularisation [of the status] of our compatriots who live in the United States\".\n\nIn their public statements at least, both of the leading Mexican presidential contenders have promised cooperation with the US against drug-trafficking.\n\nWhile critics in Mexico and the US have accused President L\u00f3pez Obrador of putting curbs on counter-narcotics cooperation, especially on the activities in Mexico of the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Ms G\u00e1lvez has said she would not limit exchange of information with the US.\n\nAcross the border in the US, Republican Party candidate Donald Trump has made it clear that he would double down on plans to secure the US border with barriers and troops, even reportedly suggesting he might send \"kill teams\" into Mexico to eliminate cartel leaders.\n\nWhen asked about a possible Trump victory, both Ms Sheinbaum and Ms G\u00e1lvez said they could handle and maintain good ties.\n\n\u201cPresident L\u00f3pez Obrador in the end had a good relationship with Trump and I don\u2019t see why we wouldn\u2019t be able to have it as well,\u201d Ms Sheinbaum said recently.\n\nMs G\u00e1lvez has also said she was \u201cnot afraid of Trump nor of Biden\u201d, and would work with either.",

Former President Donald Trump has won the Republican party nomination and President Joe Biden is fighting for his second term as the incumbent Democrat, setting the stage for a re-match between the two candidates.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump spoke to the Libertarian Party national convention in Washington DC and asked for their support. He was roundly booed.\n\nThis was no surprise to Mr Oliver, who ultimately won the party\u2019s presidential nomination after seven rounds of balloting the following day.\n\n\u201cHe came here to try to court our voters,\u201d Mr Oliver told BBC\u2019s Americast podcast on Thursday. \u201cHe got the exact Libertarian reception someone like him deserves.\u201d",

The US Constitution sets out three main requirements for being eligible to become president - and none of them reference being a convicted criminal.\n\nCandidates must have been born in the US, be over 35, and have lived in the US for at least 14 years.\n\n\"Nothing prevents him from running for president and being elected, even if he is in jail at the time of the election,\" Elizabeth Wydra, president of the progressive Constitutional Accountability Centre, told the LA Times.\n\nThat's despite people with a felony conviction - a crime that can be punished by a year or more in prison - not being allowed to vote in some states.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 0:56 What happens next for Donald Trump?\n\nBut what if he were to be elected while in prison?\n\nThis is a little more complicated, firstly because it's not clear if Trump will be sent to prison following the guilty verdict.\n\nThe convictions are class E felonies in New York, the lowest tier in the state, with each carrying a maximum sentence of four years.\n\nIn choosing the sentence, the judge will have to take into account Trump's age - he's now 77 - his lack of previous criminal convictions, and the fact that the case involves a non-violent crime.\n\nEven if the judge, Justice Juan Merchan, opts for a custodial sentence, it's likely Trump will appeal the guilty verdict - and expect to be on bail until that hearing.\n\nImage: Stormy Daniels in Manhattan in 2018. Pic: AP\n\nThat process could go all the way to the Court of Appeals, and, importantly for Trump, could drag on for months - possibly even past November's election.\n\nIf Trump were to be elected while serving time, the situation becomes more complicated still, with even constitutional experts unsure.\n\n\"It's just guessing,\" Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law expert at the University of California, Berkeley, told the New York Times earlier this year.\n\n\"We're so far removed from anything that's ever happened.\"\n\nImage: A court sketch of Justice Juan Merchan. Pic: Reuters\n\nCould power transfer to the vice president?\n\nIn theory, experts say, there is nothing to stop Trump from taking office, even if he were to be behind bars.\n\nThere is a provision - the 25th Amendment of the US Constitution - which provides a process to transfer authority to the vice president if the president is \"unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office\".\n\nHowever, that would require the approval of the vice president and members of Trump's cabinet - who will have been hand-picked by him and will no doubt be loyalists.\n\nIt is more likely, experts say, that Trump would look to sue for his release or seek a pardon to allow him to govern.\n\nImage: Pic: Reuters\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free\n\nHow will the guilty verdict impact the election?\n\nOpinion polls carried out prior to Thursday's verdict suggested it could pose a significant political danger for Trump.\n\nIn an April poll, one in four Republicans said they would not vote for Trump if he was found guilty in a criminal trial.\n\nIn the same survey, 60% of independents said they would not vote for Trump if he was convicted of a crime.\n\nWhat do the experts say about its potential impact?\n\nWhit Ayres, a Republican pollster, said he doubted a quarter of Republicans would actually shun Trump - but he said even a small number being turned off by a guilty verdict could help Joe Biden in a close election.\n\nHe said the nature of the New York case, which was brought by a Democratic prosecutor and relies on untested legal strategies, would help Trump and fellow Republicans frame a guilty verdict as a political hit job.\n\n\"If I were trying to design a court case that would be easy for Republicans to dismiss as a partisan witch hunt, I would design exactly the case that's being brought in New York,\" he said.\n\nImage: Donald Trump speaks to the media during his trial. Pic: Reuters\n\nRepublican consultant Tricia McLaughlin said she thought a guilty verdict would have a psychological impact on Trump because he hates losing.\n\nIt would also likely mean financial resources are diverted to legal bills because he would almost certainly appeal, she added.\n\nAnalyst Bill Galston said he didn't expect a guilty verdict would have a significant impact on the presidential race.\n\n\"In the end, this amounts to lying about sex. I think the view probably of the majority of Americans is that everybody lies about sex,\" said Mr Galston, who has worked on Democratic presidential campaigns.\n\nRead more from Sky News:\n\nDe Niro turns up outside Trump trial\n\nDonald Trump booed at Libertarian Party convention\n\nFollow Sky News on WhatsApp Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky News Tap here\n\nHave convicted criminals run for president before?\n\nAt least two candidates with criminal convictions have run for president in the past - although neither successfully.\n\nEugene Debs ran for president from prison in 1920, getting almost a million votes without ever hitting the campaign trail.\n\nIn 1992, Lyndon LaRouche also ran from behind bars while serving a 15-year sentence for mail fraud. He received about 26,000 votes.\n\nMore trials ahead\n\nThis case was the first of four criminal cases against Trump to go to trial, and marked the first time a former president has faced criminal charges.\n\nIt is unlikely the remaining three cases will go to trial before the November election.",

        "text": "South Africa election 2024: When will we know the result?\nSouth Africa election 2024: When will we know the result?\n\nReuters In the campaign President Cyril Ramaphosa said the ANC's achievements should not be forgotten\n\nAlmost all of the votes have been counted in South Africa after Wednesday's general election.\n\nThe governing African National Congress (ANC) has got just 40% - meaning it does not have a parliamentary majority for the first time in 30 years. It will now have to form a coalition with one or more parties.\n\nMounting criticism of the party that led the fight against apartheid under the late Nelson Mandela has chipped away at its support.\n\nWhen will we know the result?\n\nThe electoral commission is expected to announce the final results at around 18:00 local time (16:00 GMT) on Sunday, but legally it has seven days to make the announcement. The count started as soon as polls closed on Wednesday and figures are being released as the tallying and verification in various areas is completed.\n\nAll of the votes have been counted and almost all tallied but the commission has until Sunday to deal with any complaints or objections.\n\nSouth Africans have been used to knowing the result by the Saturday after polling day, but this time things are expected to take longer as there are more ballot papers to count because of the introduction of an extra vote for the national parliament.\n\nWhat happened on Wednesday?\n\nWednesday's election saw long lines of voters outside polling stations late into the night across the country, with one electoral official in Johannesburg saying the queues were reminiscent of the historic 1994 election.\n\nThat was when white-minority rule ended and the ANC came to power. This was the country's seventh democratic general election.\n\nNearly 28 million South African had registered to vote and they were electing representatives to the national and provincial parliaments.\n\nWhat is at stake for the ANC and what are its policies?\n\nThe ANC, now led by President Cyril Ramaphosa, was under growing pressure going into the election.\n\nStubbornly high unemployment, which hit 32% last year, persistent economic inequalities, corruption allegations and frequent power cuts have reduced its popularity.\n\nHigh levels of violent crime - on average 130 rapes and 80 murders a day in the last three months of 2023 - have also dented confidence in the authorities.\n\nBut the ANC said it was working to fix these problems.\n\nAnd it urged people not to throw away gains made since the end of apartheid. The party said poverty levels had fallen, a greater proportion of South Africans were living in decent homes and access to healthcare had improved.\n\nThe ANC promised to create millions more jobs over the next five years, to boost investment, support the private sector and end corruption.\n\nWhat are the DA and EFF opposition parties offering?\n\nThe main opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) said the \"country is in crisis\".\n\nIt wants to liberalise the economy, including a move towards greater privatisation.\n\nIt has pledged to create two million new jobs, end power cuts and \"halve the rate of violent crime\".\n\nEPA The DA says it can save South Africa\n\nTo address unemployment and inequality, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) - the third largest party in parliament - has radical economic solutions.\n\nThe party argued that the ANC had not redressed the racial economic imbalances of apartheid. It plans to redistribute land to the less well-off.\n\nThe EFF also wants to nationalise mines, banks and other key parts of the economy, arguing that the wealth of the country would then be used to benefit the majority of the population.\n\nWhat about Jacob Zuma and the MK party?\n\nDisgruntled former President Jacob Zuma - who was ousted by Mr Ramaphosa amid corruption allegations that he denies, and later jailed for defying a court order - is the leader of a fresh rival to the ANC.\n\nEx-President Jacob Zuma was campaigning as the leader of the new MK party\n\nThe uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) party, which took its name from the ANC's former armed wing, added further unpredictability to the race. It could make a strong showing, especially in Mr Zuma's home province of KwaZulu-Natal.\n\nBefore the election, the party saw off a court challenge by the ANC over the use of the MK name.\n\nIn a separate case, the country's highest court barred the ex-president from running for parliament. The Constitutional Court ruled that his 15-month prison sentence disqualified him. However, his image still appeared on the ballot paper.\n\nIn its manifesto, the MK party said the country took a wrong economic turn by pursuing market-led policies and that society was \"adrift from its core values\".\n\nWho will be South Africa's next president?\n\nSouth Africans do not vote directly for a president.\n\nInstead they elect the 400 members of the National Assembly, who go on to vote for a new head of state within 30 days of the general election.\n\nGetty Images The EFF says that greater state control of the economy would create a fairer society\n\nAs a result, there were no presidential candidates as such, but each party leader fronted their national campaign and their portrait appeared on the ballot paper.\n\nThe ANC's President Ramaphosa, the DA's John Steenhuisen and the EFF's Julius Malema all featured prominently.\n\nThe leader of whichever party can muster a majority in the National Assembly after the election would be expected to become the next president.\n\nHow do general elections work in South Africa?\n\nThe proportion of seats that parties are allocated in the 400-member National Assembly is directly related to their share of the vote.\n\nIn 2024, independent candidates were included for the first time.\n\nThis meant that South Africans had three votes:\n\nNational parliament: One for 200 of the seats with just political parties named on the ballot National parliament: One for the remaining 200 seats with a different ballot paper for each of the nine provinces, listing the parties in that region and independent candidates Provincial assembly: One for the independent candidates or parties in the regional legislature.\n\nHow would a coalition be formed in South Africa?\n\nThe constitution does not spell out how a coalition could be formed if no party gets more than 50% of the vote.\n\nBut assuming the ANC remains the largest party, smaller groupings could informally agree to support an ANC government on a vote-by-vote basis in return for some concessions.\n\nOr, at the other end of possibilities, the ANC could enter a formal coalition with some parties, including a written agreement outlining legislative plans and the distribution of cabinet posts.\n\nAny other party would face the same choices.\n\nAn opposition coalition has also been mooted, though analysts say this is highly unlikely.\n\nIn a pre-election deal, a group of parties - led by the DA - signed up to what has been called the Multi-Party Charter for South Africa. If together they get more than 50% of the seats, they have already agreed to form a coalition. The agreement does not include the EFF or the MK party.",

        "text": "Donald Trump: Nothing will change White House fight, lawyer tells BBC\nTrump's White House bid goes on, lawyer tells BBC\n\nDonald Trump's lawyer Alina Habba says he would run for president even if he was in jail\n\nOne of Donald Trump's lawyers has told the BBC \"nothing will change\" his fight for the White House - despite being convicted following an historic trial in New York. Jurors found Mr Trump guilty on Thursday of falsifying business records to conceal hush money payments made to former porn star Stormy Daniels during the 2016 presidential election campaign. Mr Trump became the first US president to be convicted of a crime, but he has said the trial was rigged and the prosecution was politically orchestrated. Alina Habba has told Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg the former president is a \"victim of political, selective prosecution\". Following the seven-week trial at the Manhattan Criminal Courthouse, Mr Trump was found guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records. Mr Trump will be sentenced on 11 July. However, he confirmed he will be appealing against his criminal convictions. Ms Habba, 40, appeared alongside Mr Trump during the trial and said even if jailed, Mr Trump will still stand in the US presidential election in November.\n\nGetty Images Donald Trump's attorney Alina Habba (L) appeared alongside the former US president after he was convicted\n\n\"We have seen some corruption in this country that frankly has never seen before in our judicial system,\" Ms Habba told Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg. \"It is very real, it is not posturing by any means, it is 100% a problem that this country is going to have to handle and get a grapple on in November. \"He is running for president, nothing will change there. \"The people that need him in this country, because frankly it's more important than anything anybody else thinks. \"Our people are speaking loudly, they're donating, they're small donors, and they are standing up because they are afraid, because we cannot have this happen to us.\"\n\nReuters On Thursday Donald Trump was found guilty on all 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to payments made to Stormy Daniels during his 2016 presidential campaign\n\nIn remarks at Trump Tower in New York on Friday, Mr Trump spoke for more than 30 minutes and angrily attacked his political opponents, the jury and the judge in his case. He called Judge Juan Merchan, who presided over his trial, a \"tyrant\" and claimed that he \"literally crucified\" witnesses. In response, President Joe Biden's campaign described Mr Trump as unhinged and thirsting for revenge. \"That's how the American system of justice works,\" Mr Biden said, adding it was \"reckless\" and \"irresponsible\" for anyone to suggest the trial was rigged. Mr Trump's unprecedented conviction has entrenched bitter divisions in the US, in the run-up to November's vote.\n\nProsecutors successfully laid out a case Mr Trump was afraid Ms Daniels would fatally harm his 2016 presidential campaign by going public with an alleged sexual encounter, prompting him to pay her - then illegally hide the transaction. Mr Trump denied these allegations. Ms Daniels herself gave evidence. In another development since the convictions, her lawyer told ABC News Ms Daniels wore a bulletproof vest when she went to the New York courthouse. Clark Brewster said: \"It's so vicious and threatening and so I think from the standpoint of just the fear of what somebody might do,\" he said of the atmosphere for Ms Daniels. \"It was really fear.\" In exclusive comments to the Daily Mirror, Ms Daniels said Mr Trump should be jailed or used as \"the volunteer punching bag at a women's shelter\". She told the paper: \"It\u2019s not over for me. It\u2019s never going to be over for me. \"Trump may be guilty, but I still have to live with the legacy.\u201d\n\nGetty Images Trump's team may use Stormy Daniels' testimony as grounds for appeal\n\nPreviously, Ms Daniels's husband, Barrett Blade, told CNN she felt \"a little vindicated\". Mr Blade added that despite the trial ending and bringing some relief, the stress was far from over. \"It brings another weight upon her shoulders of what happens next,\" Mr Blade said. \"We take it day by day.\"\n\nAlso on Saturday, the Trump campaign sent out a text message to supporters \u2013 one of more than a dozen sent since the verdict \u2013 which read in part: \u201cThey want me behind bars. They want me DEAD.\u201d Some of his most fervent supporters, such as former Fox News presenter Tucker Carlson, have alleged without evidence there is a secret plot to assassinate Mr Trump. Others have made a less conspiratorial argument \u2013 pointing out the maximum penalty Mr Trump faces, four years for each of 34 felony counts, would effectively mean he would spend the rest of his life in prison. Mr Trump alluded to this in his most recent fundraising message, saying his enemies are \u201cattempting to JAIL me for life as an innocent man\u201d. However, legal experts agree Mr Trump will not receive anywhere near the maximum, and will be sentenced to a much shorter jail sentence, if he is given any prison time at all.

Former President Trump's conviction proves that, in the eyes of the law, even an ex-president is just another \"mister.\"\n\nIt's also worth noting that this kind of jury trial never could have happened in the authoritarian countries that Mr. Trump so admires. Xi of China, Russia's Putin, Hungary's Orb\u00e1n, Erdo\u011fan of Turkey\u2014none would ever be tried by a jury of their peers.\n\nUnlike those countries, the United States vigorously upholds the rule of law. Our founders ardently believed \"liberty and justice for all\" would bring monarchs, despots, and populist demagogues to heel.\n\nThe good news is our judicial system ran a cogent and fair trial in New York.\n\nThe Manhattan Criminal Court has changed American presidential history forever. Out of 46 Presidents, only Mr. Trump carries the ignoble albatross of \"convicted felon.\" It's a sad phrase, but it also gives reason to rejoice that Jefferson's republic is new all over again.\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\n\n\nStory produced by Robert Marston.

        "text": "Meet Chase Oliver, the youthful Libertarian presidential nominee\nMeet Chase Oliver, the youthful US presidential candidate\n\nSergio Flores/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nSome voters in November may see a less familiar option on their presidential ballot when in the polling booth this November: Chase Oliver. Mr Oliver is this year's presidential nominee for the Libertarian Party, a political party that typically wins around one per cent of the national vote and is known for promoting civil liberties and small government. At 38 (just three years above the constitutional threshold to be a presidential candidate), Mr Oliver is by far the youngest contender in this year\u2019s field. He is also the only openly gay candidate, which he says he hopes serves as an example to aspiring LGBT politicians. The former Georgia congressional candidate finds himself as a third-party presidential nominee in an election where voters have a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Former President Donald Trump has won the Republican party nomination and President Joe Biden is fighting for his second term as the incumbent Democrat, setting the stage for a re-match between the two candidates. On Saturday, Trump spoke to the Libertarian Party national convention in Washington DC and asked for their support. He was roundly booed. This was no surprise to Mr Oliver, who ultimately won the party\u2019s presidential nomination after seven rounds of balloting the following day. \u201cHe came here to try to court our voters,\u201d Mr Oliver told BBC\u2019s Americast podcast on Thursday. \u201cHe got the exact Libertarian reception someone like him deserves.\u201d\n\nJim WATSON / AFP\n\nMr Oliver said Trump represents \u201cthe warfare state around the world\u201d and criticised his expansion of the US national debt and the Covid lockdowns during his four-year term in office. In the end, the Libertarian convention chair ruled that Trump, as the presumptive Republican nominee, was ineligible to be the Libertarian nominee. The Republican former president wasn\u2019t the only outsider to address the convention. Robert F Kennedy, who is currently organising an independent bid for president, also spoke \u2013 and his reception was significantly warmer. When it was time for balloting, however, he only received support from only about 2% of the delegates and was eliminated in the first round. In polls of the American public, however, Mr Kennedy has been doing significantly better than any third-party or independent candidate in decades, polling around 15% at his highest. That\u2019s well above the 3% that was the high-water mark for Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson in 2016 election results. Mr Oliver says he understands why Mr Kennedy, the nephew of US President John F Kennedy, would do well \u2013 but he told Americast that voters looking for an outsider are better served with his party, which is trying to build a lasting alternative to the two-party system. Mr Kennedy, he warns, is a \u201cone-and-done\u201d option who won\u2019t be around after this election. \u201cDo you want to cry out with a protest vote?\u201d he asked. \u201cOr do you want to build something that can last and build up a foundation so that we can tear down the abuses of the state together?\u201d\n\nKevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n\nDan John, from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, has been a Libertarian since the 2000s and recently became a delegate for the Libertarian party ahead of this year's national convention. Mr John said he thinks a Libertarian candidate could have more sway in this year's election cycle than in years prior. \"We've had one term of each [Biden and Trump] and you've got people who hate their lives under both,\" the 39-year-old said. \"We've got the protest vote for that reason.\" But if Mr Kennedy cuts too deeply into the Libertarian vote share in November, the party could drop below the mark many states set to receive an automatic line in upcoming presidential elections. Such a result could deal a devastating blow to the Libertarian hopes of further broadening the party\u2019s support. Lana Leguia, 32, attended the Libertarian convention and said she plans to vote for Oliver in November. \u201cI think a Libertarian candidate... is going to be direct competition for Kennedy and I think people are ready for something new, something outside of the duopoly. They\u2019re done with Trump and Biden,\u201d said the resident of Sussex County, New Jersey. Central to the Libertarian pitch is an aggressive effort to limit the scope of government by paring back spending and regulation and expanding personal freedoms. In practice, this includes decriminalising most drugs and prostitution, expanding the right to own firearms, drastically curtailing US military spending and allowing open immigration.\n\nChip Somodevilla/Getty Images",

        "text": "Mexico elects Sheinbaum as first woman president\nMexico elects Claudia Sheinbaum as first female president\n\nClaudia Sheinbaum celebrates 'historic' victory\n\nClaudia Sheinbaum has been elected as Mexico's first female president, in a historic landslide win. Mexico's official electoral authority said preliminary results showed the 61-year-old former mayor of Mexico City winning between 58% and 60% of the vote in Sunday's election. That gives her a lead of about 30 percentage points over her main rival, businesswoman X\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez. Ms Sheinbaum will replace her mentor, outgoing President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, on 1 October.\n\nGetty Images The election of a woman to the highest office was an emotional moment for some\n\nMs Sheinbaum, a former energy scientist, has promised continuity, saying that she will continue to build on the \"advances\" made by Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador, further building on the welfare programmes which have made the outgoing president very popular. But in her victory speech she also highlighted what has set this Mexican election apart from previous ones. She told cheering voters: \"For the first time in the 200 years of the [Mexican] Republic, I will become the first woman president of Mexico.\" She said it was an achievement not just for her but for all women. \"I've said it from the start, this is not just about me getting [to the top office], it's about all of us getting here.\" She added: \"I won't fail you.\" Ms Sheinbaum also thanked her rival, X\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez, who has conceded victory.\n\nPrior to running for president, Ms Sheinbaum was mayor of Mexico City, one of the most influential political positions in the country and one that is seen as paving the way for the presidency. Ms Sheinbaum, whose Jewish maternal grandparents immigrated to Mexico from Bulgaria fleeing the Nazis, had an illustrious career as a scientist before delving into politics. Her paternal grandparents hailed from Lithuania. Both of her parents were scientists and Ms Sheinbaum studied physics before going on to receive a doctorate in energy engineering. She spent years at a renowned research lab in California studying Mexican energy consumption patterns and became an expert on climate change. That experience and her student activism eventually earned her the position of secretary of the environment for Mexico City at the time when Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador was mayor of the capital. In 2018 she became the first female mayor of Mexico City, a post she held until 2023, when she stepped down to run for president.\n\nEPA Supporters of Claudia Sheinbaum gathered at the Z\u00f3calo to celebrate\n\nThe election, which pitted Ms Sheinbaum against Ms G\u00e1lvez, has been described as a sea change for women in Mexico. Edelmira Montiel, 87, said that she was grateful to be alive to see a woman elected to the top office. \"Before, we couldn't even vote, and when you could, it was to vote for the person your husband told you to vote for. Thank God that has changed and I get to live it,\" she told Reuters news agency, referring to the fact that women were only allowed to vote in national elections in 1953. While the fact that the two front-runners were women was widely celebrated, the campaign was marred by violent attacks. As well as a new president, voters were also electing all members of Mexico's Congress and governors in eight states, the head of Mexico City's government, and thousands of local officials. And it was local candidates in particular who were targeted in the run-up to the vote. The government says more than 20 were killed across Mexico, although other surveys put the total at 37. Ms G\u00e1lvez harshly criticised the government and her rival in the presidential race for the violence which blights large parts of Mexico. She promised to be \"the bravest president, a president who does confront crime\" if elected, but failed to provide many details about how she would tackle the powerful criminal cartels which are behind much of the violence. After Ms Sheinbaum's lead became unassailable, Ms G\u00e1lvez called her. \"I told her I saw a Mexico with a lot of pain and violence. I wished that she could solve the severe problems our people have,\u201d Ms G\u00e1lvez said of the call.\n\nGetty Images Ms G\u00e1lvez has conceded defeat",

        "text": "Russian disinformation network targets politicians ahead of EU elections\nA growing Russian disinformation network is targeting European Union countries ahead of the EU Parliament elections scheduled for June, researchers say, largely focused on spreading false claims about the war in Ukraine and political leaders who are critical of Russia.\n\nThe disinformation network, which operates under the \"Pravda\" name and masquerades as news websites, is now targeting all 27 EU countries with its content. Researchers from the European Digital Media Observatory say the network's use of artificial intelligence to produce high volumes of content provides an insight into Russia's disinformation tactics ahead of the U.S. presidential election.\n\nDarren Linvill, a professor at Clemson University in South Carolina who specializes in social media disinformation research, told CBS News that Russian disinformation tactics have evolved. \"Russians are masters at narrative laundering, the process of placing a false or misleading story and then weaving it into online conversations in such a way that the original source is obscured,\" he said.\n\n\"They will discredit institutions, undermine the legitimacy of the democratic process and attack moderate political candidates, both Democrat and Republican, in an attempt to drive further extremism,\" he said.\n\nScreenshot of a pravda-fr.com article. CBS News\n\nA CBS News analysis found the sham news websites published dozens of false claims over the past two weeks alone. Among them, that the U.S. will soon ramp up the conflict in Ukraine; the U.S., British and German governments were responsible for the attempted assassination of Slovakia's prime minister; and EU officials are intensifying a witch hunt amid searches for Russian interference in EU offices.\n\nProfessional media organizations tend to link news articles to the journalists who reported the information in the name of transparency. However, these fabricated articles do not. Instead, they link to Telegram accounts such as Rybar, a channel founded by Russian military blogger Mikhail Zvinchuk, who previously worked for the Russian Defense Ministry. Rybar has quickly grown to over 1.2 million subscribers for its pro-Russian stance on the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nThanos Sitistas, a lead researcher on the Pravda network for the observatory, told CBS News the Russian disinformation network may be testing which narratives have an impact. \"The tool/s they use offer a great amount of automation,\" he wrote in an email. \"For the most part, they pick up content from certain Telegram accounts and reproduce it as it is.\"\n\nScreenshot of a pravda-de.com article. CBS News\n\n\"They look for weaknesses and strong points and will eventually adjust accordingly,\" he said. \"They also map the local information landscape and could adapt their future strategies, by ascertaining which narratives have impact and which don't.\"\n\nArticles across Pravda EN and its sister websites in several European languages follow the same structure of information pulled from pro-Russian Telegram accounts.\n\nThe observatory's researchers underscored a sharp uptick in new Pravda websites in March, citing evidence that the network has expanded to at least 28 countries, including 19 EU member states. It first began with five websites launched in 2023 targeting German, English, French, Spanish and Polish languages.\n\nThe French government found in its own investigation the websites all had a common IP address hosted on a server traced to Russia, as well as the same external links and sections.\n\nScreenshot of a pravda-es.com article. CBS News\n\nRecent analysis from Microsoft's Threat Analysis Center said Russia \"remains the most committed and capable threat\" to the 2024 U.S. presidential election, with new forms of influence and interference efforts, including the use of generative AI.\n\nThe observatory's researchers said the Pravda network's websites show \"a high level of automation\" as content is published 24/7 and in high volumes. A CBS News analysis found that as many as 70 articles were published in one hour on Pravda EN, with a majority focusing on the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nU.S. agencies have increasingly warned of the usage of generative AI by foreign actors to attempt to influence the 2024 election.\n\nAdvances in generative AI are lowering the barrier to entry for U.S. adversaries including Russia to spread disinformation, FBI Director Christopher Wray said in February, while also making their tactics \"more realistic and difficult to detect.\"",

Outgoing President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador has had to account for a persistently high murder rate, with his opposition arguing for change.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nNewsletter: The Yodel Trusted news and daily delights, right in your inbox See for yourself \u2014 The Yodel is the go-to source for daily news, entertainment and feel-good stories.

According to a report translated by NPR, more than 30,000 people are murdered each year in Mexico, compared to roughly 18,500 in the U.S. in 2023.\n\n\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 Why does it matter for the U.S.?\n\nThis Mexican election came during the same year as the U.S. presidential election, a concurrence that only happens every 12 years. It\u2019s a tumultuous time for the relationship between the two countries. Mexico became the top trading partner for the U.S. last year, and both countries are trying to figure out how to deal with the worsening illegal drug trade.\n\nA motorcyclist passes under a line of campaign signs in Xochimilco, Mexico, on May 31. (Yuri Cortez/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nAnother major issue for voters this year was Mexico\u2019s migration policies on both its southern and northern borders. The National Migration Institute (INM) recorded a 77% increase in migrant arrivals from 2022 to 2023, according to CNN.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIn December, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed a bill that would allow officials in that state to detain and report people suspected of entering the U.S. illegally. The law is currently blocked by a U.S. federal court, and the current Mexican government said it will only discuss immigration issues with federal officials. Both leading presidential candidates support Mexico's stance.\n\nJorge Huerta Cabrera, a candidate running for a council seat in the town of Izucar de Matamoros, was shot and killed at a political rally on Friday, according to the state prosecutor\u2019s office. On Wednesday, mayoral candidate Jos\u00e9 Alfredo Cabrera Barrientos was gunned down during his closing campaign speech. He was among the 560 candidates and election officials given security guards by the government because of persistent threats.\n\nAltogether, 37 candidates have been assassinated this election season \u2014 and that\u2019s not counting failed assassination attempts, Reuters reported. Integralia counted 828 nonlethal attacks on political candidates during the current election campaign.\n\n\ud83c\udfc6 Who is Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico's first female president?\n\nSheinbaum, a member of the ruling party, was widely expected to win Sunday's vote and become Mexico's first female president \u2014 a major step for a country well-known for its \u201cmacho\u201d culture. The 61-year-old is a former Mexico City mayor and climate scientist.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nSheinbaum has long been an ally of the incumbent president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who won in a landslide in 2018. They share principles and even campaign slogans at times.\n\nHer main opponent was former Senator X\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez, who is also 61. G\u00e1lvez criticized incumbent L\u00f3pez Obrador for his \u201chugs not bullets\u201d policy of avoiding confrontation with drug cartels, who have gained control of large parts of Mexico.\n\nClaudia Sheinbaum, left, and Xochitl Galvez, at the last presidential debate in Mexico City on May 19.

It also covers events and trends that affect the stability and decision-making of the Iranian regime. The Critical Threats Project (CTP) at the American Enterprise Institute and the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) provides these updates regularly based on regional events. Click here to see CTP and ISW\u2019s interactive map of Israeli ground operations. This map is updated daily alongside the static maps present in this report.\n\nCTP-ISW defines the \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d as the unconventional alliance that Iran has cultivated in the Middle East since the Islamic Republic came to power in 1979. This transnational coalition is comprised of state, semi-state, and non-state actors that cooperate to secure their collective interests. Tehran considers itself to be both part of the alliance and its leader. Iran furnishes these groups with varying levels of financial, military, and political support in exchange for some degree of influence or control over their actions. Some are traditional proxies that are highly responsive to Iranian direction, while others are partners over which Iran exerts more limited influence. Members of the Axis of Resistance are united by their grand strategic objectives, which include eroding and eventually expelling American influence from the Middle East, destroying the Israeli state, or both. Pursuing these objectives and supporting the Axis of Resistance to those ends have become cornerstones of Iranian regional strategy.\n\nWe do not report in detail on war crimes because these activities are well-covered in Western media and do not directly affect the military operations we are assessing and forecasting. We utterly condemn violations of the laws of armed conflict and the Geneva Conventions and crimes against humanity even though we do not describe them in these reports.\n\nHardliners overwhelmingly dominate the candidate pool for the upcoming Iranian presidential election.

Safeguards are IAEA activities that enable the IAEA to verify that a state is not using its nuclear programs for nuclear-weapons purposes.\u201d[38] Grossi added that \u201cpublic statements made in Iran\u201d made about Iran\u2019s ability \u201cto produce nuclear weapons and possible changes to Iran\u2019s nuclear doctrine\u201d increased his concerns about the \u201ccorrectness and completeness of Iran\u2019s safeguards declarations.\u201d[39] Iranian officials have increasingly normalized discussions about Iran\u2019s ability to procure a nuclear weapon in recent months, as CTP previously reported.[40]\n\nThe Associated Press cited a confidential IAEA report on May 27 that reported that Iran increased its stockpile of 60 percent enriched uranium from 121.5 kilograms to 142.1 kilograms (a 16.95 percent increase).[41] Weapons-grade uranium is uranium that is enriched to 90 percent purity. A US expert noted on May 28 that, based on the confidential IAEA report, Iran could produce enough weapons-grade uranium (WGU) for almost eight nuclear weapons in the first month after breakout.[42]\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on June 3 that Israel will not agree to a permanent ceasefire until Israel achieves its war objectives.[43] US President Joe Biden outlined the latest Israeli ceasefire proposal and encouraged both Hamas and Israel to accept it during a speech on May 31.[44] He said that the proposal includes an initial six-week ceasefire with a partial Israeli military withdrawal and the release of some hostages while Hamas and Israel negotiate a permanent end to hostilities.[45] Netanyahu said on June 3 that Biden\u2019s outline of the proposal was only \u201cpartial.\u201d[46] Israel has confirmed that it approves the proposal that Biden outlined but insisted that a permanent ceasefire is only possible once Israel achieves its war objectives.[47] Two right-wing members of Netanyahu\u2018s coalition have threatened to dissolve the Israeli government if Netanyahu agrees to end the war.[48] Netanyahu said that Israel is insisting that a second phase of the ceasefire can begin only after there is an agreement on the terms of the complete ceasefire.[49] This would allow Israel to retain the right to resume fighting in the Gaza Strip as long as Israel views that the negotiations are futile. Netanyahu said during a closed-door parliamentary meeting that Israel could initiate the first phase of the proposal without an agreement on what follows.[50]\n\nHamas official Suheil al Hindi told The Washington Post on June 3 that Hamas is still discussing the ceasefire proposal that Biden presented.[51] Hamas told international mediators that it wants a detailed proposal that reflects the one Biden presented in his speech.[52] Hamas officials told international mediators that the latest Israeli proposal described a period of \u201csustainable calm\u201c in ambiguous terms, suggesting that Hamas was not confident that the \u201csustainable calm\u201c would secure Hamas\u2018 key demand, a permanent ceasefire.[53] Hamas stated on May 31 that it is willing to engage \"positively and constructively\" with the latest Israeli ceasefire proposal, so long as it meets Hamas\u2019 maximalist demands.[54] Qatar sent the Israeli proposal to Hamas on May 30.[55] A senior US official mentioned that the proposal is \"nearly identical\" to one presented by Hamas three weeks prior before that proposal was unilaterally altered by Egyptian intelligence.[56] Hamas has not issued an official response to the Israeli proposal at the time of writing.\n\nHamas may reject the agreement if the agreement fails to secure Hamas\u2019 maximalist objectives, which include a permanent ceasefire. Hamas remains confident that it can survive Israeli military operations in the Gaza Strip, and it can therefore pursue its maximalist demands without major concessions. CTP-ISW has previously noted that Hamas\u2019 confidence in its survival increased, and its ceasefire demands appear to have solidified as the IDF drew down its forces in the Gaza Strip beginning in late December 2023.[57] Hamas leader in the Gaza Strip Yahya Sinwar expressed confidence in February 2024, stating that Hamas is \"doing fine\" amid Israeli clearing operations.[58] Sinwar conveyed to Arab mediators in early May 2024 that he is in no hurry to end the war, as it is drawing international condemnation of Israel and reviving the Palestinian national cause.[59]\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and War Cabinet member Benny Gantz on June 2.[60] Blinken commended Israel for its latest ceasefire proposal and emphasized that Hamas should accept the deal without delay.\n\nIsraeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said on June 2 that Israel is assessing an alternative governing authority to Hamas in the Gaza Strip.[61] Gallant stated that Israel will isolate areas in the Gaza Strip, remove Hamas operatives, and bring in other forces to enable an alternative government. He emphasized that Israel will not accept Hamas\u2019 rule.[62] Hamas will violently resist and undermine alternative governing authorities that do not include it. An Israeli intelligence source confirmed on June 1 that Hamas killed the head of a local clan in the Gaza Strip, disrupting an Israeli plan to replace Hamas as the primary governing authority.[63]\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\nIranian Presidential Elections: Hardliners overwhelmingly dominate the candidate pool for the upcoming Iranian presidential election.

The IDF 679th Brigade (99th Division) directed strikes on Palestinian sniper positions and located a munitions warehouse containing \"dozens\" of rocket components during operations in Sabra and Zaytoun.[67] Israeli forces have conducted at least five separate operations in this area of southern Gaza City during the war.[68] Palestinian fighters, including Hamas, targeted Israeli forces with rocket-propelled grenades and mortar fire in Sabra.[69] Palestinian fighters also targeted Israeli forces along the Netzarim Corridor with indirect fire.[70]\n\nIsraeli forces continued clearing operations in central Rafah on June 3. The IDF 89th Commando Brigade raided an \"active combat complex\" in Rafah.[71] Israeli forces located tunnel shafts, and a weapons stash including long-range rockets, \u201dcombat transmission systems,\u201d and explosive charges.[72] Israeli forces directed a drone strike on a Palestinian fighter during the raid.[73] The IDF Air Force also struck a separate Hamas weapons production site in Rafah.[74] Three Palestinian militias have mortared Israeli forces along the Egypt-Gaza Strip border since CTP-ISW's last data cut off on June 2.[75] Palestinian fighters targeted Israeli forces across Rafah Governorate with improvised explosive devices and rocket-propelled grenades.[76]\n\nThe IDF Air Force targeted over 50 Palestinian sites across the Gaza Strip on June 3.[77]\n\nUS, Israeli, and Egyptian officials discussed ways to reopen the Rafah border crossing during talks in Cairo on June 2.[78] Egyptian officials said that the three sides would continue discussions in the coming days, though the three negotiating parties have made little progress.[79] Two Egyptian security sources told Reuters that Egypt is maintaining that Israel must withdraw from the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing in order for the crossing to operate again.[80] Unspecified US officials said that the United States will prioritize reopening the Rafah border crossing for aid deliveries, preventing Hamas from smuggling weapons from Egypt into the Gaza Strip, and \u201dmaintaining a tenuous peace between Israel and Egypt.\u201d[81]\n\nThe IDF announced on June 3 that four Israeli hostages died in captivity in the Gaza Strip.[82] Hamas abducted the Israelis during its October 7, 2023, attack and still holds their bodies.[83] The IDF is examining the circumstances of their deaths, which occurred a few months ago in Khan Younis.[84]\n\nPalestinian militias did not conduct any indirect fire attacks from the Gaza Strip into Israel on June 3.\n\nWest Bank\n\nAxis of Resistance objectives:\n\nEstablish the West Bank as a viable front against Israel\n\nIsraeli forces have engaged Palestinian fighters in at least six locations in the West Bank since CTP-ISW's last data cut off on June 2.[85] The al Aqsa Martyrs\u2019 Brigades fired small arms and detonated IEDs targeting Israeli forces in the Balata refugee camp in Nablus.[86]\n\nPalestinian fighters continue to seek to attack Israeli towns from the West Bank. The Israeli Shin Bet announced on June 3 that it arrested a Hamas fighter in Nablus in March 2024 who had planned to conduct a suicide IED attack in Israel.[87] The fighter is originally from Tulkarm in the West Bank but had been based in Jordan. A Hamas member in Turkey recruited the fighter, according to the Shin Bet. The fighter underwent military training in an unspecified location and Hamas sent the fighter funding and instructions for the attack. The Shin Bet also detained several Hamas fighters from Nablus who the Shin Bet suspected helped to manufacture the IED.\n\nThis arrest underscores that Hamas and other Palestinian militias in the West Bank continue to maintain cells focused on attacking Israeli towns and cities outside the West Bank.[88] Israeli forces killed a Palestinian man in Zeita, along the West Bank-Israel barrier, en route to conduct a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv in March.[89] Hamas and the al Aqsa Martyrs\u2019 Brigades claimed three separate attacks targeting Bat Hefer, an Israeli town immediately adjacent to Tulkarm, in May.[90] The al Aqsa Martyrs\u2019 Brigade claimed that in one of the attacks their fighters entered Israel itself.\n\nPalestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas publicly condemned a speech given by Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei on June 3.[91] Khamenei\u2019s June 3 speech praised the October 7 attacks.[92] Abbas said that Khamenei\u2019s speech sought to \u201csacrifice Palestinian blood\u201d and would not lead to the creation of a Palestinian state.[93]\n\nThis map is not an exhaustive depiction of clashes and demonstrations in the West Bank.\n\nSouthern Lebanon and Golan Heights\n\nAxis of Resistance objectives:\n\nDeter Israel from conducting a ground operation into Lebanon\n\nPrepare for an expanded and protracted conflict with Israel in the near term\n\nExpel the United States from Syria\n\nLebanese Hezbollah has conducted at least 11 attacks into northern Israel since CTP-ISW's last data cutoff on June 2.[94] Hezbollah conducted three one-way drone attacks targeting Israeli forces in northern Israel during the reporting period.[95]\n\nAn Israeli Army Radio correspondent reported on June 3 that the IDF faces challenges intercepting drones targeting northern Israel. Other military forces, including the US Army, have also encountered challenges combatting Iranian-made drones in the Middle East.[96] The correspondent said that the IDF is working to improve technological and defensive capabilities to resolve these challenges. The challenges of defending against drone attacks have emerged in other areas in the Middle East. The US Army faced persistent one-way drone attacks from Iranian-backed militias in Iraq and Syria between 2023 and 2024.[97] The IDF\u2019s experience in northern Israel bears several similarities to the US Army\u2019s experience in Iraq and Syria in 2023 and 2024. Both the IDF and the US Army defend fixed positions under fire from one-way attack drones manufactured by or with assistance from Iran that targeted US positions in Iraq and Syria and IDF positions in northern Israel in ones and twos, for example.[98]\n\nAn Israeli research center reported on June 2 that Hezbollah has significantly increased its drone attacks against Israel since the Israel-Hamas war began in October 2023.[99] The report is consistent with CTP-ISW's data on Hezbollah drone attacks targeting northern Israel. Hezbollah more than doubled its drone attacks between April and May 2024.[100]\n\nThe Israeli Air Force conducted an airstrike that killed a Hezbollah engineer in Tyre, southern Lebanon, on June 3.[101] The IDF said the engineer, Ali Hussein Sabra, improved and equipped Hezbollah air defenses.[102] The Israeli Air Force also struck several military compounds that Hezbollah used for its air defense systems in Qotrani, southern Lebanon.[103] Hezbollah mourned the death of Sabra on June 3.[104]\n\nRecorded reports of attacks; CTP-ISW cannot independently verify impact.\n\nIran and Axis of Resistance\n\nIsrael likely conducted an airstrike that targeted Iranian-backed militia infrastructure north of Aleppo, Syria and killed IRGC advisor Saeid Abyar on June 3. The Syrian Ministry of Defense reported that Israel conducted an airstrike targeting multiple sites near Aleppo.[105] Syrian sources reported that Israel targeted an industrial complex operated by Iranian-backed militias in Hayyan, north of Aleppo City.[106] Iranian regime-affiliated media reported that Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) advisor Saeid Abyar was killed in the airstrike.[107] Syrian media also reported that at least 15 Iranian-backed militia members were killed, including two members of Lebanese Hezbollah.[108] CTP-ISW cannot verify this local reporting. The Israeli strike in Aleppo is a continuation of Israel\u2019s air campaign targeting IRGC and Iranian-backed personnel, weapons, and infrastructure in Syria. Iranian-backed militias have historically maintained a presence north of Aleppo in the nearby towns of Nubl and Zahra.[109] The IDF has increased its air campaign in Syria since December 2023 to disrupt Iranian-backed efforts to transfer of military materiel to Lebanon and Syria.[110]\n\nIran is seeking to restore diplomatic relations with Bahrain. Iranian media widely circulated Bahraini King Hamad bin Isa al Khalifah\u2019s June 1 statement in which King Hamad bin Isa said that Bahrain aims to restore ties with Iran.[111] King Hamad bin Isa made these remarks in separate meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang, suggesting that China may seek to facilitate such discussions between Bahrain and Iran.[112] China previously brokered an agreement to restore ties between Iran and Saudi Arabia in March 2023.[113] Acting Iranian Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Bagheri Kani separately called for expanded relations with Arab countries\u2014particularly Bahrain, Jordan, and Egypt\u2014on May 25.[114] Bahraini diplomats also attended deceased former President Ebrahim Raisi\u2019s funeral in Tehran on May 22.[115]\n\nReports suggesting that Iran and Bahrain will soon normalize ties follow two attack claims from an Iranian-backed Bahraini militia in late April and early May. The Saraya al Ashtar militia claimed that it conducted separate drone attack targeting in Eilat, Israel, on May 2 and April 27.[116] CTP-ISW cannot verify that Bahrainis conducted the attack or that the attack originated in Bahrain. The first attack targeted the Israeli transportation company Trucknet Enterprise, suggesting that the attack was part of the Iranian-led campaign to impose an unofficial blockade on Israel.[117]\n\nActing Iranian Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Bagheri Kani traveled to Beirut on June 3, marking his first foreign visit since becoming foreign affairs minister on May 20.[118] The Iranian Foreign Affairs Ministry reported that unspecified Axis of Resistance representatives welcomed Bagheri Kani at the airport in Beirut.[119] Bagheri Kani claimed that the \u201cIslamic Resistance in Lebanon\u201d is an important \u201canchor of stability and peace\u201d in the Middle East during a joint press conference with Lebanese Foreign Affairs Minister Abdallah Bouhabib.[120] The Islamic Resistance in Lebanon is another name for Lebanese Hezbollah. Bagheri Kani also met with Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati.[121] Bagheri Kani\u2019s visit to Lebanon follows his meeting with IRGC Quds Force Commander Brigadier General Esmail Ghaani on May 28, during which Ghaani praised former Foreign Affairs Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian\u2019s frequent diplomatic engagements with Axis of Resistance leaders.[122] Bagheri Kani\u2019s visit also comes after Axis of Resistance leaders, including Lebanese Hezbollah leaders, held a Joint Operations Room meeting in Tehran on May 23.[123]\n\nThe Islamic Resistance in Iraq\u2014a coalition of Iranian-backed Iraqi militias\u2014conducted a drone attack targeting Haifa, Israel, on June 2.[124] The drone purportedly targeted a \u201cvital target\u201d in Haifa. CTP-ISW is unable to independently verify the attack claim.\n\nThe Houthis likely launched a ballistic missile from the Red Sea targeting Israel on June 3.[125] Israel\u2019s Arrow ballistic missile defense system intercepted the surface-to-surface ballistic missile over Eilat.[126] There were no casualties.[127] The Houthis have not claimed the attack as of this writing.\n\nUS Central Command (CENTCOM) intercepted one Houthi one-way attack drone over the Red Sea on June 2.[128] CENTCOM assessed that the drone presented an imminent threat to US, coalition, and merchant vessels in the area.\n\n[1] https://ifpnews dot com/iran-interior-minister-80-people-president/\n\n[2] https://www.tasnimnews dot com/fa/news/1403/03/01/3090189\n\n[3] https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/irans-presidential-election-what-know\n\n[4] https://www.tasnimnews dot com/fa/news/1403/03/14/3097667\n\n[5] https://www.mehrnews dot com/news/4935939/%D9%85%D8%AD%D9%85%D8%AF%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%B1-%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%84%DB%8C%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%81-%D8%B1%D8%A6%DB%8C%D8%B3-%D9%85%D8%AC%D9%84%D8%B3-%D8%B4%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%85%DB%8C-%D8%B4%D8%AF\n\n[6] https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-may-28-2024\n\n[7] https://www.loc.gov/item/lcwaN0019080/\n\n[8] https://www.criticalthreats.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/pdf_uploadanalysisThe_IRGC_Command_Network-1.pdf\n\n[9] https://www.loc.gov/item/lcwaN0019080/\n\n[10] https://www.tasnimnews dot com/fa/news/1403/03/12/3096282/\n\n[11] https://www.tabnak dot ir/fa/news/1240622/%D9%88%D8%AD%DB%8C%D8%AF-%D8%AD%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C%D8%A7%D9%86-%DA%A9%DB%8C%D8%B3%D8%AA ;\n\nhttps://iranwire.com/en/features/69798/\n\n[12] https://www.asriran dot com/fa/news/971606\n\n[13] https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm824\n\n[14] https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm824\n\n[15] https://www.tabnak dot ir/fa/news/1240622/%D9%88%D8%AD%DB%8C%D8%AF-%D8%AD%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C%D8%A7%D9%86-%DA%A9%DB%8C%D8%B3%D8%AA\n\n[16] https://www.tasnimnews dot com/fa/news/1403/03/12/3096282/ ;\n\nhttps://www.tasnimnews dot com/fa/news/1403/03/14/3097667 ;\n\nhttps://x.com/AmirMiresmaeili/status/1797609509869023450\n\n[17] https://www.iranintl.com/en/202406016958\n\n[18] https://www.iranintl.com/en/202406016958\n\n[19] https://www.canada.ca/en/global-affairs/news/2024/03/canada-imposes-new-sanctions-against-two-individuals-for-their-participation-in-violent-repression-of-iranian-women-and-girls.html\n\n[20] https://borna dot news/fa/news/2101779\n\n[21] https://www.iranintl.com/202406034567\n\n[22] https://www.tasnimnews dot com/fa/news/1403/03/13/3097009 ;\n\nhttps://www.tasnimnews dot com/fa/news/1403/03/14/3097667\n\n[23] https://iranwire.com/en/features/67353/\n\n[24] https://www.gov.uk/government/news/i-commend-their-bravery-foreign-secretary-recognises-bravery-of-iranian-people-on-anniversary-of-mahsa-amini-death\n\n[25] https://www.tasnimnews dot com/fa/news/1403/03/12/3096282/\n\n[26] https://iranwire.com/en/features/70110/\n\n[27] https://www.unitedagainstnucleariran.com/people/alireza-zakani\n\n[28] https://www.france24 dot com/en/asia-pacific/20210616-reformist-mehralizadeh-drops-out-of-iran-presidential-election-race\n\n[29] https://www.unitedagainstnucleariran dot com/people/alireza-zakani ;\n\nhttps://www.rouydad24.ir/fa/news/154718\n\n[30] https://www.tasnimnews dot com/fa/news/1403/03/14/3097667\n\n[31] https://x.com/rezahakbari/status/1797585004341449121\n\n[32] https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-39939619\n\n[33] https://x.com/JasonMBrodsky/status/1797572056386580860\n\n[34] https://www.tasnimnews dot com/fa/news/1403/03/13/3097009\n\n[35] https://www.lemonde dot fr/en/international/article/2024/06/02/iranian-ex-president-ahmadinejad-registers-for-election-to-replace-late-raisi_6673468_4.html\n\n[36] https://www.lemonde dot fr/en/international/article/2024/06/02/iranian-ex-president-ahmadinejad-registers-for-election-to-replace-late-raisi_6673468_4.html\n\n[37] https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/statements/iaea-director-generals-introductory-statement-to-the-board-of-governors-3-june-2024\n\n[38] https://www.iaea.org/publications/factsheets/iaea-safeguards-overview\n\n[39] https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/statements/iaea-director-generals-introductory-statement-to-the-board-of-governors-3-june-2024\n\n[40] https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-may-13-2024\n\n[41] https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-may-28-2024\n\n[42] https://x.com/DAVIDHALBRIGHT1/status/1795383881744490795\n\n[43] https://x.com/GLZRadio/status/1797590589195915403;

Thank God that has changed and I get to live it,\" she told Reuters news agency, referring to the fact that women were only allowed to vote in national elections in 1953.\n\nWhile the fact that the two front-runners were women was widely celebrated, the campaign was marred by violent attacks.\n\nAs well as a new president, voters were also electing all members of Mexico's Congress and governors in eight states, the head of Mexico City's government, and thousands of local officials.\n\nAnd it was local candidates in particular who were targeted in the run-up to the vote.\n\nThe government says more than 20 were killed across Mexico, although other surveys put the total at 37.\n\nMs G\u00e1lvez harshly criticised the government and her rival in the presidential race for the violence which blights large parts of Mexico.\n\nShe promised to be \"the bravest president, a president who does confront crime\" if elected, but failed to provide many details about how she would tackle the powerful criminal cartels which are behind much of the violence.\n\nAfter Ms Sheinbaum's lead became unassailable, Ms G\u00e1lvez called her.\n\n\"I told her I saw a Mexico with a lot of pain and violence. I wished that she could solve the severe problems our people have,\u201d Ms G\u00e1lvez said of the call.",

        "text": "Mexico Elected its First Woman President: What Does this Mean for the Country\u2019s Gender-Based Violence and Insecurity Crisis?\nOn Sunday, 2 June, Mexico elected its first woman president: Claudia Sheinbaum.\n\nSymbolically, this represents a huge leap forward for women in Mexico. While the country has been a regional forerunner in terms of the participation of women in politics, its most powerful role has never been held by a woman. Her victory should not be examined in isolation. It is the result of the extraordinary social, institutional, and cultural changes the country has experienced in questions of gender parity and women\u2019s participation in public positions.\n\nWith that said, Sheinbaum is inheriting a country wracked with complex challenges, from crime to economic growth, from a human rights crisis to the intensifying impacts of climate change.\n\nIn terms of security, homicides, disappearances, extortions, and femicides represent enormous challenges that need to be tackled through the strengthening of the justice system and the civilian police forces. While Claudia Sheinbaum has pledged to address some of the institutional and social roots of insecurity, she has also expressed her decision to continue with the security strategies of current president L\u00f3pez Obrador, including the militarization of public security functions.\n\nWith mounting evidence about the detrimental effects of the current government\u2019s security policies, will Mexico\u2019s first female president redirect the state\u2019s responses to violence and crime?\n\nThe country that Claudia Sheinbaum is inheriting\n\nSheinbaum will take on the presidency during one of the most violent periods Mexico has ever experienced. Homicide rates have slightly decreased recently, but the number of people killed yearly in Mexico continues at historical heights. In absolute numbers, Lopez Obrador\u2019s sexenio has been the most violent in the history of the country. From the moment he took office up until December of 2023, there were a total of 166.193 victims of homicides.\n\nDisappearances have also been on the rise in recent years. Sheinbaum, like her predecessor, has a complicated relationship with the collectives of victims looking for their missing and murdered relatives. Controversially, she has argued that disappearances are carried out by criminal groups and not the state, a statement that has been easily disproved by evidence put forward by international human rights watchdogs.\n\nThe implications of Mexico\u2019s security crisis goes beyond its human rights factors. Under L\u00f3pez Obrador, the military has been deployed around the country at historical levels. Despite such militarization, many parts of the country continue to experience extreme violence at the hands of criminal organizations and a recent study documented an \u201cuneasy coexistence\u201d between military commanders and criminal groups in certain regions of Mexico. Criminal groups are fragmented, and their level of penetration and control is significant and deeply worrisome. Extortion has increased at the local level, and recent reports suggest that everyone from tortilla vendors to small business owners are being targeted.\n\nViolence and insecurity have a gender component. Femicides are the most visible and dramatic expression of the many faces of violence and insecurity that women face on a daily basis. Rather than being the inevitable result of the country\u2019s so-called \u201cmachista\u201d culture, the increase in femicides and women\u2019s disappearances are connected to the broader insecurity context and to a scenario where militarization has put women and girls in harm\u2019s way.\n\nSecurity policies under Sheinbaum\n\nSheinbaum has recognized insecurity and violence as central challenges for the country\u2019s political and social stability. She has also recognized femicides and gender-based violence as a key component of Mexico\u2019s context of insecurity. And yet, the proposals she has presented so far fail to incorporate a gender and human rights lens that can move the country away from the militarized and punitive approaches that have led to the current crisis.\n\nFor instance, the security strategy she presented during her campaign includes five main areas, such as addressing the social causes of insecurity, consolidating the National Guard, strengthening the state\u2019s capacity to investigate and gather intelligence, improve coordination between the state police and the prosecutors offices, and reforming the judicial system.\n\nWhile some of these areas could indeed result in security policies that advance the institutional reforms and social transformations the country badly needs, others will likely reproduce the same mistakes of the past. Saliently, the consolidation of the National Guard is set to occur hand in hand with the continuing militarization of public security provision, to the detriment of prevention programs, alternative justice mechanisms, or the strengthening of the police at the state and local levels. Militarization has deepened human rights violations, from the use of torture, to disappearances, and arbitrary detentions and, without clear civilian controls, these violations will continue to occur. Sheinbaum\u2019s proposal regarding the creation of social programs to reduce crime, particularly youth crime, is more promising. However, the success of these programs in crime reduction and violence prevention is hard to measure, particularly in the short to medium term.\n\nPart of the problem of Sheinbaum\u2019s security proposals is that they are contradictory at best, and, at worst, they seem to echo or replicate L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s failed security strategies. For instance, when it comes to femicides, Sheinbaum has stated that all homicides against women should be investigated as femicides and has suggested that each state in Mexico should have a specialized prosecutor's office to tackle the problem of femicides. These are steps in the right direction as evidence has shown legislative harmonization of the crime of femicides is needed and that specialized prosecutor's offices have had a positive effect in the investigation of femicides. Nevertheless, even if both of these measures would be implemented under Sheinbaum\u2019s tenure, the ongoing militarization of the country next to the levels of lethality, impunity, and human rights violations that the military has generated, will undo or undermine any beneficial effects of these policies. Indeed, one of the key blind spots in Sheinbaum\u2019s security proposals is recognizing that, in order to address gender-based violence and violence more broadly, the country needs to demilitarize.\n\nWhat next?\n\nWhen it comes to Mexico\u2019s human rights crisis, evidence reveals how militarization begets more violence. Since 2007, and in the last six years in particular, the rate of feminicides and disappearances of women has skyrocketed. Thus, Sheinbaum\u2019s ongoing support for militarizing public security and other functions will likely serve to block any advances she claims she will make in terms of reducing gender-based violence.\n\nWith that said, this election represents a watershed moment for Mexico, even if Sheinbaum has a limited understanding or engagement with gender-based issues. Her election reflects the incredible social, cultural, and institutional transformation the country has undergone. It is the result of the struggle of thousands of women who have worked for decades to not only have a voice and representation, but also to be able to make decisions at the highest levels.\n\nSheinbaum will govern a country where women, victims\u2019 collectives, and feminists form a critical mass that will demand from her more comprehensive and just policies. While she may not bring a gender perspective to her rule, she will find herself forced to engage with those elements of society \u2013 in civil society, academia, journalism, and political parties \u2013 who will spend the next six years mobilizing for gender justice and holding her accountable to Mexico\u2019s women.",

        "text": "The $64 million mystery: How a wave of anonymous donations is fueling the 2024 presidential campaign\nWashington hates a secret.\n\nYet in the summer of 2020, when a blandly named entity called the Impetus Fund received a $64 million donation from a single anonymous source, it touched off a guessing game with broad political implications.\n\nThat single anonymous donation, routed through a series of accounts, eventually would be used to help Joe Biden defeat Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election. Critics say it has come to illustrate an increasingly opaque system of funding elections that in 2024 could reach a scale that dwarfs all previous election cycles.\n\nThe source of that donation remains unknown \u2014 and not for lack of effort. Fox News first reported on the curious donation in 2023, but was unable to ferret out the donor's identity. A cottage industry of public interest groups and investigative reporters who dig relentlessly to unmask big-dollar donors, also came up empty.\n\nMost speculate the money originated with a single, super-wealthy Biden supporter. But it could also have come from a privately held company or a shell corporation, an increasingly common tactic used by well-heeled donors seeking to add layers of anonymity to their political largesse. It remains a $64 million mystery \u2014 and while legal, it's one that critics say underscores what's wrong with today's campaign finance system.\n\n\"Without information about who is funding groups spending to influence elections, voters won't know who is trying to color their views, won't be aware of any potential conflicts of interest that a funder has or what stake they may have in the outcome of the election,\" said Anna Massoglia, editorial and investigations manager at OpenSecrets, a non-partisan watchdog organization that tracks the influence of money on politics.\n\nMassoglia is one of the most persistent sleuths tracking the flow of money in American politics. She and other campaign finance watchdogs have developed a strong theory about how the money moved. After landing in the Impetus Fund, which is a 501c4 tax-exempt organization, the donation passed through a series of entities in a kind of shell game that conceals from voters the interest and agendas that lie behind the money and messages \u2014 with each step further shielding the identity of the source. A 501c4 nonprofit is required by the IRS to promote social welfare as its primary function, and it is not required to disclose its donors.\n\nFirst, $55 million of that initial donation moved to the nonprofit arm of the Biden super PAC, Future Forward USA Action, which had been anointed by allies of President Biden as the primary super PAC supporting his reelection. Then, a few weeks before the 2020 election, Future Forward USA Action moved $60 million to FF PAC, as the main campaign committee is commonly known. That committee, also a super PAC, is required to disclose its donors. But since it received the money from its own nonprofit, the original source of the contribution remained under wraps. Future Forward was then able to spend freely on electioneering, including explicit endorsements of candidates, so long as it did not explicitly coordinate those efforts with the Biden campaign.\n\n\"This kind of circular laundering of dark money is a very common operation now,\" said Craig Holman, a campaign finance expert at Public Citizen, which advocates for a more transparent system of election funding. \"It's a sorry state of affairs.\"\n\nFuture Forward declined to comment.\n\nDemocrats have long decried the lack of transparency in the campaign finance system and have advocated to close the dark money loophole that currently exists in the law. But some critics say it smacks of hypocrisy.\n\n\"For too long the left has been playing a game of decrying dark money while at the same time being fully dependent on it, even supercharging Mr. Biden's reelection campaign,\" says Caitlin Sutherland, executive director of the right-leaning government watchdog group Americans for Public Trust.\n\nOthers say that it's unrealistic to expect Democrats to unilaterally disarm. \"That would be a big ask of Biden not to set up a super PAC and not to accept dark money,\" Holman of Public Citizen said.\n\nMr. Biden and his campaign have at various times voiced both sides of this argument. In September 2022, the president appeared in the White House briefing room to advocate for the Disclose Act, which would require political groups and nonprofits to disclose donations above $10,000.\n\n\"There's much too much money that flows in the shadows to influence our elections,\" Mr. Biden said. \"Dark money erodes public trust.\"\n\nBut when asked directly about the proliferation of dark money the Biden effort is benefitting from, his aides had a different take: \"The stakes of this election are sky high,\" one Biden adviser told CBS News. \"We will protect our democracy with every tool that is legally available.\"\n\nOr as one Democratic strategist said, \"You don't show up at a gun fight with a knife.\"\n\nA new era for anonymous donors\n\nThe most far-reaching campaign finance laws of the modern era were passed almost exactly 50 years ago in the wake of the Watergate scandal when campaigns were still receiving unlimited and often untraceable amounts of money, sometimes in suitcases of cash. In 1974, Congress imposed significant new limits on contributions to campaigns from individuals, corporations and political groups. It also created the FEC to enforce those restrictions.\n\nBut campaign watchdogs say money, like water, always seems to find a way. Within a few years, amendments to the Federal Election Campaign Act had given rise to the era of unlimited contributions from corporations and unions that were supposed to be limited to so-called \"party building\" efforts, restrictions that were easily circumvented to benefit campaigns.\n\nIn 2002, Congress passed the McCain-Feingold Act which attempted to close those loopholes. But a short eight years later, a series of Supreme Court rulings struck down spending limits on corporations and unions, radically altering the campaign finance landscape. Knowingly or not, the court ushered in the era of the super PAC and, with it, a proliferation of other nonprofit organizations that were not required to disclose their donations under U.S. tax law.\n\nTorrents of so-called dark money began flowing and a whole ecosystem of opaque groups began forming to raise and distribute that money. One of those entities was the Impetus Fund.\n\nDemocratic dark money web\n\nLocated on the eighth floor of a Washington, D.C., office building, there is little indication the Impetus Fund is anything more than a vehicle to take in and redistribute money. A directory of offices in the hallway does not mention Impetus. A receptionist who serves multiple businesses on the floor says she has rarely, if ever, seen anyone from the organization.\n\n\"They're a virtual client,\" she says cheerfully. Its website is equally spare, with innocuous statements about its mission. \"Impetus Fund works with changemakers across the country to unlock a more inclusive, accessible, and vibrant democracy,\" the site says. Impetus Fund's president is Ezra Reese, the political law chair at the Elias Law Group, which was founded by Marc Elias. Elias, a longtime Democratic Party lawyer who was general counsel for the presidential campaigns of Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, founded his law practice with an eye toward \"electing Democrats, supporting voting rights, and helping progressives make change,\" its website says.\n\nImpetus is a creation of a progressive D.C. firm called Arabella Advisors, which oversees a web of nonprofits that today funnels more dark money into American elections and political causes than any on either side of the political divide. Founded in 2005 as a kind of facilitator for tax-exempt organizations and charitable donors, Arabella provides back-office functions for nonprofits, including legal advice, human resources, accounting and the like.\n\nOne of its services is helping donors maintain their anonymity. There are many legitimate reasons why charitable donors seek to remain anonymous. Sometimes it's rooted in humility. Other times they seek to avoid being hit up for other donations. When it comes to political giving, they may not want to court controversy in these polarized times. But good-government advocates say voters have a right to know who is behind the tsunami of ads and other messages that are overwhelming American politics today.\n\n\"Transparency is crucial for a fully functional government that is accountable to the people,\" said OpenSecrets' Massoglia.\n\nArabella is a dark money juggernaut. Through its constellation of nonprofits, it brought in close to $3 billion in dark money in the 2022 cycle. The behemoth in the Arabella network, the Sixteen Thirty Fund, raised nearly $380 million in that same cycle. In 2020 it steered $410 million to help defeat Donald Trump and win back the Senate for Democrats.\n\nAnd though the big political spending by tradition starts after the 4th of July holiday, they already appear to be gearing up for the current presidential cycle. Arabella entities are helping fund progressive causes, like climate change and marijuana legalization. Lately, they have poured money into state ballot initiatives, particularly where there are competitive Senate or House seats, possibly as a way of driving turnout.\n\nSteve Sampson, an Arabella spokesman, declined comment on the Impetus donation, saying only that Arabella provides consulting services to foundations and nonprofit organizations, including helping them stay compliant with relevant laws and regulations. He added that \"Arabella does not donate funds to political campaigns or candidates.\"\n\nSome of the money reaches super PACs like Future Forward.\n\nWill there be another $64 million mystery?\n\nIn January, FF PAC announced that it had raised $250 million, a sum that it plans to use for an unprecedented ad blitz starting immediately after the Democratic National Convention in August and going through Election Day. A significant portion of that money comes from dark sources, although the specific breakdowns won't be known until everything it raised is reported to the FEC.\n\nIn its April campaign disclosure, Future Forward reported that it had raised $16.2 million, two thirds of it coming from dark money sources through its nonprofit arm. Entities supporting the election of Donald Trump have also raised millions in dark money, but so far are lagging behind the Biden effort. But just last week, a new dark money group supporting Trump, Securing American Greatness, put up an ad in Pennsylvania that criticized Mr. Biden on inflation, Politico reported. And with more than five months to go before the election in November, there is still time for backers of Trump to close the gap.\n\nThere are indications that the Trump operation is beginning to catch up in the overall money race, despite Biden's sizable lead for the past few months. For now, though, Biden still has a significant cash-on-hand advantage, and he's continuing to bring money into the campaign, attending a fundraiser in Greenwich Monday, hobnobbing with hedge fund managers and people from the entertainment industry.\n\nImpetus has been quiet so far. But campaign finance experts have noticed stirrings. Earlier this month, after four years of operation, Impetus launched a website. Entering the campaign late, as it did in 2020, has advantages. If Impetus cranks up its fundraising later this summer, the dark money watch dogs will have nothing to chase until public filings are disclosed \u2014 after the election is over. Impetus did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThat could mean another $64 million dark money mystery.",

        "text": "Catholic Trump voters see no choice in upcoming election \u2014 even after conviction\nFormer President Donald Trump speaks during a news conference at Trump Tower, May 31, 2024, in New York, a day after a New York jury found Trump guilty of 34 felony charges. (AP photo/Julia Nikhinson)\n\nRobert Stenson has some reservations about Donald Trump as president, but he plans on voting for him anyway. \"There's a lot of baggage with Trump, a lot of things I don't agree with,\" says the attorney from southern California. But Stenson believes Trump most aligns with his concerns about government overreach, both domestically and in \"new wars\" overseas. Brian Rumschlag, a software architect in Indiana, says his faith guides everything in his life, including his choice for president. A self-described \"card-carrying Republican,\" he has voted for Trump in the past and plans to vote for him in 2024. Overturning Roe v. Wade was Trump's \"crowning achievement,\" he says. \"That was a huge, huge win for the culture at large.\" Abortion is also the \"No. 1\" issue for Keara Burke of Illinois, who supports a national ban. Although she admits that Trump has \"taken a few steps backward\" on the issue, she still calls him \"the most pro-life president in the history of the country.\" But even if abortion were not on the table, she would vote for Trump, because of what she calls the \"failed economic policies\" of the Biden administration. She and her husband work in real estate and construction and notice that \"American families are struggling,\" she said. Stenson, Rumschlag and Burke \u2014 and other Catholic Trump voters who spoke to NCR \u2014 may disagree somewhat about why they support Trump. But they agree that to vote Democratic, even for a fellow Catholic like Joe Biden, would be anathema to their faith and their conservative principles. Even a third-party candidate, whose chances these voters deemed unrealistic, would be preferable to a Democrat, they said. \"It boggles my mind how anyone can call themselves a Catholic and vote Democratic,\" said one Trump voter, who asked that his name not be used because of his job with the New York City police department. Another said he grew up in a Republican home where to vote for a Democrat was seen as \"evil.\" Not even Trump's conviction on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records seems to change many Trump supporters' minds. A survey shortly after the verdict showed that more than half of voters overall approved of the jurors' decision, but that only 8% of Trump supporters want Trump to drop his White House bid.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden and former U.S. President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump are pictured in a combination photo. (OSV News photo/Reuters/Leah Millis/Amr Alfiky)\n\nRumschlag is not bothered by what he considers \"a paperwork crime.\" And because so many Trump supporters see the conviction as unfair, Burke believes it may even strengthen voters' commitment to Trump. Generations of Catholic immigrants used to be counted on as Democratic stalwarts, but for the last several presidential elections, the Catholic vote has been evenly split. As columnist E.J. Dionne Jr. famously said in 2000: \"There is no 'Catholic vote.' And yet, it matters\" \u2014 because at the time there was no Catholic bloc that moved predictably toward one party or the other. Catholics were the ultimate swing vote \u2014 and were concentrated in key industrial states. An April survey from the Pew Research Center indicates a shift toward the GOP among Catholics, even among Latinos. A majority of Catholic voters, 55%, said they preferred Trump over Biden, by a whopping 12 percentage points. Among white Catholic voters the numbers were even higher, with 61% of respondents opting for Trump, and only 38% for Biden. While the Catholic numbers are still much lower than those of white evangelical Protestants \u2014 who preferred Trump to Biden, 81% to 17% \u2014 they indicate that Catholics have joined the right-ward trend of religious Americans.\n\n\"The myth of the white Catholic Democrat hasn't been true for 50 years,\" said Ryan Burge, an associate professor of political science at Eastern Illinois University and one of the country's leading data analysts on politics and religion. \"Religious people tend to be Republicans now, outside the Black church,\" he said. \"If you're a white person and religious, you're almost Republican by default.\" The most recent Pew study showed Latino Catholics narrowly favoring Biden, 49% to 47%, but previous research indicates that Latinos, too, are moving toward the GOP, according to Pew editor and writer Jens Manuel Krogstad. \"This trend toward the Republican Party has happened across demographic groups of Latinos,\" including gender and educational level, he said, although the shift toward the GOP is stronger among Latino men and those without college degrees. These trends \u2014 while good news for Trump and Republicans and not-so-good for Biden and Democrats \u2014 actually signify that the Catholic vote will matter less in this election, according to political scientist Steven P. Millies. \"Catholic voters no longer are a representative sample of the United States,\" said Millies, professor of public theology and director of the Bernardin Center at Catholic Theological Union in Chicago.\n\n'Catholic voters no longer are a representative sample of the United States.' \u2014Steven P. Millies Tweet this\n\nThat's because what it means to be Catholic is shifting, Millies said, noting that disaffiliation among more progressive Catholics has reduced Catholic identity to cultural opposition to issues such as abortion, LGBTQ issues and others.\n\nSteve Millies, director of the Bernardin Center at Catholic Theological Union in Chicago (Courtesy of Steve Millies)\n\nWhat it means to be a Republican also has changed, he said. \"Republicanism is no longer a political party, it's a brand of cultural dissatisfaction. It's not about governing; it's about opposition.\" As with evangelicals, political identity trumps a religious one, even as the whole religious sector of the electorate is shrinking, Millies said. And Catholics no longer represent a swing constituency. \"Whatever else the Biden era means, it's the end of political relevance of the Catholic vote,\" he said. \"As a voice in the public square, we don't matter.\" Abortion and LGBTQ issues For the New York City police officer who supports Trump, abortion \u2014 or what he believes should be more accurately termed \"baby murder\" \u2014 is tantamount to a genocide and is the primary reason he supports the GOP. \"Abortion is the willful execution of one of God's children,\" he told NCR. \"I find it surreal that people can look past that.\" LGBTQ issues \u2014 especially those involving transgender people \u2014 are a close second in terms of this voter's priorities. And although he converted to Catholicism as an adult, he identifies these as essential Catholic issues \u2014 likely prompted by the U.S. Catholic bishops repeatedly identifying abortion as the church's \"preeminent\" priority. \"Because of our teaching on abortion and homosexuality, I think [Trump] is closer to living Catholic values than our 'Catholic' president,\" the New Yorker said. For Burke, the Illinois voter, the issue of abortion is personal. When she was pregnant with her fifth child, the baby was diagnosed with Trisomy 18. The doctors suggested termination, but she chose to carry her son, Rory, to term. He lived five days.\n\nThen-President Donald Trump speaks Jan. 24, 2020, during the annual March for Life rally in Washington. (CNS/Tyler Orsburn)\n\nInspired by the support they received during that time, Burke founded Rory's Way, an organization that offers support for parents facing a life-limiting diagnosis for their babies and options to carry their babies to term and care for them as long as they are able. Burke was especially offended that Biden invited Kate Cox, the Texas woman who sought an abortion for her child with Trisomy 18, to this year's State of the Union address. Burke feels Biden misled voters about Texas' new abortion law and feels Cox was used as a \"political pawn.\" \"Is this the compassionate America that we want to live in?\" she asked. A younger Texas voter, who asked that his name not be used, admits he somewhat automatically voted Republican in his first presidential election in 2020. But after getting involved in pro-life advocacy in college, he now intentionally is favoring Trump, mainly over the issue of abortion. Now graduated and working in aviation, he acknowledges that others in his generation are more left-leaning, but says that fellow Catholics at his college campus ministry center celebrated when Roe v. Wade was overturned. Like him, these young Catholics don't fit in either party, he said. For example, he says he is more progressive on gun reform and health care reform. \"But they're not the important issues, as far as directly affecting the way we live.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLGBTQ issues also significantly influence his vote, he says. \"As a Catholic, the model of the family is very important to me, and I view it as the building block of society. When the definition of marriage and family erodes away, everything starts to crumble.\" Trump, whatever his limitations, including recent support for in vitro fertilization, \"represents the party that is fighting against these issues,\" he said. That both the Republican Party and the Catholic Church are seen as \"fighting against these issues\" is key for many Catholics who support Trump. In contrast, Biden seems to be leaning into his party's pro-choice base, as Democrats see abortion as a winning issue, given public opinion polls that show majority support for legal abortion. Ironically, with Roe overturned and Trump sending muddled signals on the issue, abortion should no longer be a top issue this election, said Millies. Yet half of the Catholic Trump voters interviewed by NCR mentioned it as a top issue. Millies believes the issue of abortion operates subtly, even subliminally, for Republican voters. \"It becomes code for, 'Let's go back to the old days when everybody did what they were supposed to do,' \" said Millies, who has written a book trying to reclaim Cardinal Joseph Bernardin's seamless garment approach to life issues.\n\nPro-life demonstrators in Washington celebrate outside the U.S. Supreme Court June 24, 2022, as the court overruled its landmark Roe v. Wade abortion precedent in its Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization ruling. The case involved a Mississippi law banning most abortions after 15 weeks. (OSV News/Reuters/Evelyn Hockstein)\n\nBurge agrees, calling abortion \"the dinner party excuse why people are Republican,\" because it \"ends the conversation very quickly.\" Burge points out that a statistically small number of American voters see abortion as murder; even among Republicans that view is the fringe, Burge said. \"Most Republicans are in favor of abortion rights at some level,\" he said. So if abortion is not driving most Republicans' political choices, what is? Burge says instead of faith informing politics, partisan identity has become the \"master identity.\" Once faith and party are linked, voting for the other party becomes unthinkable. Trump's negatives dismissed This tight connection between identities, and the shared attitude of cultural opposition, could explain why pro-life Republicans don't abandon Trump, even as he softens his views on abortion. Adamantly pro-choice before entering politics, Trump has so far refused to support a national ban. His political strategy seems to be to take credit for appointing the Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe, but also to support a more moderate position of letting states decide abortion policy. The young Texas voter admits it's \"disappointing\" to see Trump \"kind of walk back\" on the issue. \"But between a president who has advocated for pro-life issues \u2014 maybe not to the fullest extent I would like \u2014 and President Joe Biden, who has said many, many times that he would like to codify Roe versus Wade, it's an easy choice.\" The New York voter opts for Trump because \"a little abortion is better than a lot of abortion.\" (The number of abortions in the U.S. has risen since the overturning of Roe, after a decades-long decline.) \"I personally think [Trump's] against it, but he's walking it back because unfortunately he has to play the game,\" said the New York voter. \"Our society has become so depraved that basic morality has become an 'extremist' right position.\" Other voters said they \"don't know Trump's heart\" on this issue, but they are willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, given his responsibility for the success of overturning Roe.\n\nIn fact, Trump gets a pass on just about any concerns that can be raised about him: his personal immorality, his moves toward authoritarianism and lack of support for democratic norms. The Trump voters who spoke to NCR dismissed these concerns as not particularly serious, or even as misinformation conspiracies. Others said they are confident the rule of law will hold. Stenson says the narrative pushed by the mainstream media that Trump is \"a singular threat to American democracy\" is \"laughable.\" Such allegations are \"the last gasp of a desperate establishment that's trying to hold onto power but is worried they'll lose it.\" Jan. 6, 2021, was not an insurrection, according to those who support Trump. \"We've been told how MAGA Republicans are a bunch of gun-toting white supremacists,\" Stenson told NCR. \"But it's interesting that no one showed up with any weapons, if that's what they are.\" Trump's repeated claim that the Jan. 6 rioters were unarmed has been debunked, as many rioters were armed with guns, stun guns, batons, baseball bats and chemical sprays. More than 130 have been charged with using a deadly or dangerous weapon. According to the Catholic Trump voters interviewed by NCR, nearly all politicians are immoral and corrupt, so Trump's personal morality is not an issue.\n\n'I'm not voting for the next parish council president. I'm voting for the president of the United States.' \u2014Keara Burke Tweet this\n\n\"I'm not voting for the next parish council president. I'm voting for the president of the United States,\" said Burke, explaining why Trump's personal life doesn't factor into her decision. Others noted that Trump's marital infidelity was a problem for his soul, but his private sins don't disqualify him from public office. \"He's not publicly advocating for cheating on your spouse,\" explained the Texas voter, contrasting that to Biden's support for abortion. Even Trump's brash, sometimes rude, attitude is a plus for Rumschlag, the Indiana voter. \"That's actually a positive,\" he told NCR. \"I like some good old-fashioned American swagger. We lost that during the Obama years. Trump was able to bring that back.\" The only issue that provided some conflict with Catholic Trump voters' faith was immigration. Those who spoke with NCR acknowledged that they agreed with Scripture's directive to \"welcome the stranger\" \u2014 and were aware of Pope Francis' emphasis on the issue \u2014 but emphasized the need for only \"legal immigration\" and accused Biden of supporting \"open borders.\"\n\n'I like some good old-fashioned American swagger.

Tuesday\u2019s contests will be the first since Haley said two weeks ago that she would vote for Trump in November. They may be an indicator of whether her supporters will follow her.\n\nBiden has faced his own ongoing protest vote in recent contests as Democratic voters unhappy with his handling of Israel\u2019s war with Hamas seek to register their disapproval. There are organized campaigns in several states Tuesday to vote for \u201cuncommitted\u201d in the Democratic contests. In New Jersey\u2019s primary, \u201cuncommitted\u201d will be on the ballot in many counties above the phrase, \u201cJustice For Palestine, Permanent Ceasefire Now!\u201d\n\nAfter Tuesday, Democrats have two additional caucuses on June 8, for Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands, to close out their 2024 primary calendar.\n\nBeyond the presidential contests, the states are holding primary elections for federal and local races Tuesday, with one of the most watched being the Republican Senate race in Montana.\n\nRetired Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy has the backing of Trump and national Republican leaders as he faces two other candidates in the race. The winner will challenge Democratic Sen. Jon Tester in what\u2019s expected to be one of the most competitive races that could decide control of the chamber.",

        "text": "6 Insights on Mexico\u2019s Historic Election: Stanford Scholars Explain What This Means for the Future of its Democracy\nOn Sunday, June 2, Mexico held its federal, state, and municipal elections. Sunday\u2019s poll was historic in more than one sense. Mexico, a democracy in its mid-twenties, had never previously embarked on an election as large in scale, with more than 20,000 vacant public offices at all levels of government to be filled by an electorate of almost 100 million eligible voters. For the first time in the country\u2019s history, a woman, Claudia Sheinbaum, was elected to spearhead the government of the world\u2019s most populous Spanish-speaking nation. Finally, these events took place in the shadows of record-high, albeit stable, levels of drug-related violence.\n\nIn this Q&A roundtable organized by the Center on Democracy, Development and the Rule of Law\u2019s (CDDRL) Poverty, Violence, and Governance Lab (PovGov) and the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a panel of scholars discuss six main insights from Mexico\u2019s elections and what they tell us about the state of Mexico\u2019s democracy.*\n\nPanelists:\n\nBeatriz Magaloni , Graham H. Stuart Professor of International Relations and Professor of Political Science in the School of Humanities and Sciences and Senior Fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute at Stanford University\n\n, Graham H.

What explains why Mexico has accomplished this milestone, even before the United States?\n\nBeatriz Magaloni: It is incredibly exciting, especially considering our history of machismo and a patriarchal society where women have traditionally been followers, not leaders. Mexico enacted a significant gender parity reform about two years ago, which mandates gender parity across all political parties and levels of government. This transformation to include women began then, and it is amazing that the next step is electing a woman president.\n\nWere the elections in Mexico clean and fair by international standards?\n\nBeatriz Magaloni: Mexico has a long history of institutional reform that created bodies like the National Electoral Institute (INE). These institutions have persisted, even though Andres Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador (whom everyone refers to as AMLO) tried to weaken them. Fortunately, they withstood these attacks, and we can see how essential they are for elections. I can confidently say that we had free and fair elections by international standards. Mexico has the capacity to orchestrate inspiring elections, and this should serve as a lesson to powerholders about the importance of sustaining these institutions.\n\nWhat worries me about the election results is the supermajority the MORENA coalition won. Likely, Claudia has the majority necessary in both the Senate and Congress to modify the Constitution unilaterally and pass laws unilaterally. I worry that Mexico is going back to the era of hegemony we suffered from for 70 years under the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).",

SATISH BABU / Getty Images\n\nIndia's 2024 general election - which was held over six weeks between 19 April and 1 June - has been the biggest the world has ever seen.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi is hoping to win a third successive term, but opposition parties have said Indians face the loss of many freedoms if he stays in power.\n\nWhat is the INDIA party?\n\nThe main challenge in 2024 comes from the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (India), a coalition of opposition parties including the once-dominant Congress party.\n\nKey politicians in this group include Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, as well as siblings Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi, whose father was the former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.\n\nTheir mother, Sonia Gandhi, is a powerful opposition leader but is not expected to campaign as hard as she did in 2019.\n\nDelhi's governing Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is part of the coalition, along with several important regional parties.\n\nThree AAP leaders have recently been arrested, accused of corruption. The party accuses Mr Modi and the BJP of conducting a political vendetta against it, which the BJP denies.\n\nThe alliance comprises more than two dozen parties in total.\n\nWhat is the NDA?\n\nThe National Democratic Alliance (NDA) is a coalition of parties led by the BJP, and leans centre-right politically.\n\nIt was founded in 1998 and is currently in power in India.\n\nHow many seats did BJP win in 2019?\n\nIn the 2019 election the BJP won 303 seats, and the NDA took 352 seats overall.\n\nWhat were the key issues and why does the India general election matter?\n\nMr Modi can claim India's global standing has risen thanks to its growing economy and closer relations with the US, which wants India to be its ally against China.\n\nHe has recently introduced generous welfare schemes, such as providing free grain to 800 million of India's poorest, and a monthly stipend of 1,250 rupees ($16; \u00a312) to women from low-income families.\n\nGetty Images Rahul Gandhi is one of the leaders of the \"India\" coalition of parties challenging the BJP\n\nIn its manifesto Congress argued that unemployment remains high, especially for young people.\n\nAnd it promised increased welfare payments for women, three million extra government jobs and more apprenticeships for college leavers.\n\nIt also promised that it would stop India's \"slide into autocracy\".\n\nMinority groups say that they often face discrimination and attacks, and have been forced to live as \"second-class\" citizens under Mr Modi's rule - an allegation the BJP denies.\n\nThe campaign group for international civil liberties, Freedom House, says that journalists and others who question the BJP government have increasingly been harassed. It classifies India as only \"partly free\".\n\nWhat were the dates of the polling days, and why does voting take so long?\n\nVoting took place in different parts of India on seven polling days: 19 April, 26 April, 7 May, 13 May, 20 May, 25 May and 1 June.\n\nThe results are announced on 4 June.\n\nVoting was staggered to enable security staff to guard polling stations across the country.\n\nMillions of electronic voting machines have been used, which let people choose between candidates or pick \"none of the above\".\n\nGetty Images\n\nAfter people cast their ballots, they were marked with indelible ink to prevent them voting again.\n\nThe ink stains the skin and fingernails purple when exposed to sunlight, stays on for about two weeks and is almost impossible to remove.\n\nHow many seats are needed to form a government?\n\nThere are a total of 543 seats in the parliament, so a party or alliance needs more than 272 seats to form government.\n\nThe Lok Sabha chooses the prime minister, who in turns chooses government ministers.\n\nWho can vote in elections for the Lok Sabha?\n\nIndia is the world's most populous country, with 1.4 billion inhabitants, and 969 million of them have been able vote in this year's election - roughly one in eight of the global population.\n\nVoters must be Indian citizens, 18 years of age or older and be on the electoral register. They also need valid voter ID cards.\n\nGetty Images 969 million people are eligible to vote in India's 2024 general election\n\nThe 13.4 million Indian citizens who live abroad are also eligible to vote, but they would have been required to register and return to India to do so.\n\nMembers of the Lok Sabha are elected for a five-year term to represent a single constituency, the winner being the candidate with the most votes.\n\nThere are 131 seats reserved for MPs from so-called \"scheduled castes\" and \"scheduled tribes\". These are groups officially recognised as disadvantaged, and make up about a quarter of India's population.\n\nIndia has also passed a law to allocate a third of the seats to women, but this will not come into force for several years.\n\nHow are all the votes collected across India?\n\nIndia is 1.3 million sq miles (3.3 million sq km) in area, and electoral rules say there must be a polling booth close to every human habitation.\n\nThe 2019 elections had a polling booth in a remote forest area of the Gir National Park in Gujarat for the one man living there.",

A vice presidential debate has not yet been scheduled because Trump has not yet announced a running mate.\n\nHere are some of the key dates and outcomes on this year\u2019s political calendar.\n\n2024 election calendar\n\nFormer President Donald Trump in Des Moines, Iowa, on Jan. 15. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nJan. 15: Iowa GOP caucuses\n\nTrump scored a decisive victory, while Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis edged out Haley for second place. Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy finished a distant fourth, suspended his campaign and endorsed Trump.\n\nJan. 23: New Hampshire primary\n\nTrump defeated Haley, his lone remaining challenger in the GOP race after DeSantis dropped out two days before the primary. Biden won in New Hampshire despite not being on the ballot due to a rift between the Granite State and the Democratic National Committee, which decided to make the South Carolina Democratic primary on Feb. 3 its first formal contest.\n\nFeb. 3: South Carolina Democratic primary\n\nFacing nominal opposition in a state where he has long been a favorite among Democrats, Biden won easily, capturing more than 96% of the vote, with self-help author Marianne Williamson and Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips splitting the rest.\n\nFeb. 6: Nevada primary\n\nNikki Haley at a campaign stop in Aiken, S.C., on Feb. 5. (Allison Joyce/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nHaley suffered an embarrassing loss in the Republican presidential primary in Nevada on Feb. 6, receiving fewer votes than the \u201cnone of these candidates\u201d option. It was a contest in which Trump did not compete and the state party tried to have it canceled. Nonetheless, a combination of intense support for Trump and distaste for Haley among Republican voters in the state combined to deal her an unusual humiliation. Biden won Nevada\u2019s Democratic primary handily.\n\nFeb. 8: Nevada and U.S. Virgin Islands caucuses\n\nTrump easily won the Nevada caucuses, as expected. Haley was not on the ballot, but Nevada Republicans made clear that they want Trump to be their nominee against Biden in November\u2019s general election. The former president also won the Virgin Islands Republican caucuses, picking up all four delegates available from the U.S. territory in a contest that Haley had actually campaigned in.\n\nFeb. 13: Long Island special election\n\nDemocrat Tom Suozzi won the special election in New York\u2019s Third Congressional District, defeating Republican Mazi Pilip in the race to replace George Santos, who was expelled from Congress in December following a scathing House Ethics Committee report that concluded that Santos \u201cblatantly stole from his campaign.\u201d\n\nFeb. 24: South Carolina Republican primary\n\nDespite Haley serving as the state\u2019s governor for six years, Trump was declared the winner in South Carolina at 7 p.m. ET, just as polls in the state closed.\n\nFeb. 27: Michigan primary\n\nTrump and Biden easily won their respective primaries in a state crucial to each of their presidential election victories. But Biden faced a sizable \"uncommitted\" protest vote led by Muslim and Arab Americans who have been disillusioned by his response to Israel\u2019s bombardment of Gaza. With about 98% of the votes counted, more than 100,000 Michigan Democrats (or 13%) had cast ballots for \u201cuncommitted.\u201d\n\nMarch 5: Super Tuesday\n\nTrump and Biden swept nearly all of this year\u2019s Super Tuesday primaries and caucuses. Haley won the Vermont Republican primary, denying Trump a clean sweep; Biden lost to political unknown Jason Palmer in the sparsely attended Democratic caucuses in American Samoa.\n\nMarch 12: Trump and Biden clinch nominations\n\nPresident Biden at an event in Milwaukee on March 13, a day after clinching the 2024 Democratic nomination. (Scott Olson/Getty Images)\n\nBoth Trump and Biden clinched the nomination for president inside their respective parties in the latest round of state primary contests. The former president has won 1,241 of the 1,215 needed to claim the majority. Biden has 2,107 pledged delegates of the 1,968 needed for the nomination.\n\nMarch 19: Arizona, Florida, Illinois, Kansas and Ohio primaries\n\nBiden and Trump swept uncontested primaries in Arizona, Florida, Illinois, Kanas and Ohio, adding hundreds of delegates to their respective tallies and continuing their unimpeded march to the summer conventions, where they will formally accept their parties\u2019 nominations.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThere were, however, intriguing downballot contests too. In Ohio, Bernie Moreno \u2014 a Trump-backed candidate who faced questions about an online profile seeking casual sexual encounters with men \u2014 won the GOP Senate primary and will take on longtime Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown in November.\n\nJune 4: Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico and South Dakota primaries\n\nBiden and Trump swept their respective primaries in Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico and South Dakota \u2014 the last four U.S. states to hold nominating contests this year.\n\nIn New Jersey, Rep. Andy Kim won the Democratic primary for Senate in New Jersey, according to the Associated Press. Kim is seeking the seat currently held by Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez, who is on trial, facing federal corruption charges. Menendez filed to run for reelection as an independent on Monday. Menendez\u2019s son, Democratic Rep. Rob Menendez, was also projected to survive a primary challenge in his congressional race.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAnd the late New Jersey Rep. Donald Payne Jr. won the Democratic nomination for another term in the House on Tuesday, weeks after he died in office. A special election to choose someone to serve the remainder of Payne\u2019s current term has already been set; the state's Democratic Party is expected to meet this summer to decide who it will nominate to replace him on the November ballot.\n\nConventions\n\nThe United Center in Chicago, the site of the 2024 Democratic National Convention.

Jason Wambsgans/Chicago Tribune/Tribune News Service via Getty Images)\n\nJuly 15-18: Republican National Convention\n\nThe event will be held in Milwaukee, which hosted the 2020 Democratic National Convention during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAug. 19-22: Democratic National Convention\n\nThe event will be held in Chicago, which has hosted 11 previous Democratic conventions \u2014 most recently in 1996, when Bill Clinton and Al Gore were nominated for reelection. It was also the site of the disastrous 1968 Democratic convention, which was held in the wake of the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy and marred by massive antiwar protests that turned violent.\n\nDebates\n\nTrump and Biden during a presidential debate in Nashville in 2020.

Both candidates have agreed to take part in the event, which will be hosted by CNN.\n\nSept. 10: Presidential debate\n\nThe second presidential debate of the 2024 cycle is tentatively scheduled for Sept. 10. ABC will host the event at a location yet to be determined.\n\nNov. 5: Election Day\n\nBarring a surprise, it'll be Trump vs. Biden II on Nov. 5. The last time a presidential rematch happened was in 1956, when Republican President Dwight Eisenhower defeated Adlai Stevenson, the same Democrat he had beaten in 1952.",

        "text": "Biden says asylum restrictions necessary to 'control border'\nBiden announces asylum restrictions to \u2018control border\u2019\n\nEPA The number of migrant arrivals at the US-Mexico border has been steadily falling this year\n\nPresident Joe Biden has issued a sweeping executive order aimed at curbing record migrant arrivals at the US-Mexico border that have left him politically vulnerable in an election year. Under the order, which took effect at midnight, officials can quickly remove migrants entering the US illegally without processing their asylum requests. That will happen once a daily threshold is met and the border is \"overwhelmed\", the White House said in a statement. Rival Republicans say Mr Biden has not gone far enough, while some of the president's Democratic allies - and the United Nations - have expressed concern.\n\nA spokeswoman for the UN's refugee agency said those fearing persecution should have access to safe territory. Mr Biden spoke about the order at an event on Tuesday with several border town mayors. He said \"this action will help us gain control of our border\". The president criticised Republicans for not passing bipartisan immigration reform in Congress earlier this year - and asked left-wing critics of the new executive action to \"be patient\". \"We're wearing thin right now,\" he said. \"Doing nothing is not an option.\" The order - which also aims to speed up cases and ease pressure on overburdened US immigration courts - has met criticism from activists. \"It\u2019s unfortunate that politics are driving the immigration conversation in an increasingly restrictive direction,\" said Jennie Murray, president and the CEO of the National Immigration Forum. More than 6.4 million migrants have been stopped crossing into the US illegally during Joe Biden's administration. The arrival numbers have plummeted this year, though experts believe that trend is unlikely to continue. Mexican media have depicted the move as one of Mr Biden's toughest policies, though President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador sought to downplay the issue, arguing that economic and cultural exchange made a border closure \"impossible\". Authorities in Tijuana asked what would happen to asylum seekers denied entry to the US. Shelters in the Mexican city could quickly get overcrowded, one local official warned. \"We\u2019d start seeing people on the streets, sleeping in tents\u201d.\n\nBiden announces ban on migrants crossing border unlawfully\n\nAbout a dozen advocates and Democratic lawmakers had their own press conference outside the US Capitol on Tuesday, criticising Mr Biden's decision. Pramila Jayapal, the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said she was \"profoundly disappointed\" by the executive action and called it a \"step in the wrong direction\". Others in Mr Biden's party disagreed - including Ruben Gallego, an Arizona congressman, who said there was still \"more work to do\". The campaign for Donald Trump, Mr Biden's Republican challenger for the presidency, earlier argued that the order \u201cis for amnesty, not border security\u201d. In Tuesday's statement after the president's announcement, the White House said that the new order \"will be in effect when high levels of encounters at the southern border exceed our ability to deliver timely consequences, as is the case today.\" Among the actions announced on Tuesday were the use of a 1952 law that allows access to the American asylum system to be restricted. The law, known as 212(f), allows a US president to \"suspend the entry\" of foreigners if their arrival is \"detrimental to the interests\" of the country. The same regulation was used by the Trump administration to ban immigration and travel from several predominantly Muslim countries and to bar migrants from asylum if they were apprehended crossing into the US illegally, provoking accusations of racism. \"While there\u2019s no question the US needs to better address challenges at the border, the use of 212(f) authority is concerning,\" Ms Murray said.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers criticise Biden's border initiative\n\nMs Jayapal told the BBC she was concerned that Mr Biden's actions could spark legal battles. ''When Donald Trump did this, the ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union) filed a lawsuit and it was declared unconstitutional, she said. \"This is a different executive order. So things may be different.\" But, she added, \"we are at serious risk of being in violation of our own laws\". The Biden administration plans to defend the new policies in court from any challenges it could face from activists or Republican-led states. It has said the restrictions will come into effect when the seven-day average for daily crossings hits 2,500. \"These actions will be in effect when the southern border is overwhelmed, and they will make it easier for immigration officers to quickly remove individuals who do not have a legal basis to remain,\" the White House said. The border will reopen to asylum seekers only when the average figure holds at 1,500 over a seven-day period - and it will then reopen to migrants two weeks later. Other measures are aimed at quickly resolving immigration cases in court, and expedited removals for those found to have no legal basis to remain in the US. Asylum processing at ports of entry will continue under the order. About 1,500 asylum seekers go through the process at official crossings each day, mostly after setting up appointments using a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) app known as CBP One.\n\nGuerline Jozef, executive director of Haitian Bridge Alliance - which works with Haitian migrants at the border - called the announcement \"a direct assault on the fundamental human right to seek asylum\". \"This Trump-era policy will leave thousands of vulnerable individuals, including families, children, and those fleeing violence and persecution, without the protection and refuge they need,\" Ms Jozef said. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, senior administration officials pushed back on comparisons with Trump-era policies, saying the new rules would only apply during periods of increased arrivals. They said exemptions would be made for unaccompanied children and those being trafficked. Republicans, meanwhile, have criticised the Biden border plan as an election-year ruse - and have argued for tougher action. They argue that US laws already exist to prevent illegal immigration but are not being duly enforced by the Democratic president. The officials and the White House have sought to lay the blame on Republicans who stood in the way of a bipartisan border security deal that failed earlier this year. \"Republicans in Congress chose to put partisan politics ahead of our national security,\" the White House said.",

        "text": "General Assembly Elects Phil\u00e9mon Yang of Cameroon President of Seventy-Ninth Session, Selects Main Committee Bureaus\nIn a series of elections today, delegates in the General Assembly chose its President for the seventy-ninth session, the Bureaus of the six Main Committees, as well the five non-permanent members of the Security Council for the next two-year term.\n\nPhil\u00e9mon Yang (Cameroon), who was elected by acclamation to serve as the Assembly\u2019s next President, announced the theme of his presidency: \u201cUnity and diversity for advancing peace, sustainable development and human dignity, everywhere and for all.\u201d\n\nThanking his predecessors, including the current President, for the \u201cart and science\u201d that each of them deployed during their term\u2019s complex deliberations, he expressed appreciation to all Member States. Highlighting the solidarity of the African Group, he said the African Union spared no effort to achieve the choice of a single continental candidate, while the Central African States endorsed Cameroon very early on at the Economic Community of Central African States Summit. Further, the election is an honour for his country, he said, paying tribute to the wisdom of its President, Paul Biya.\n\n\u201cWe are living in very difficult times marked by very striking contrast,\u201d he said, noting conflicts around the world and the unbearable toll on civilians and refugees, \u201cwhose numbers are currently reaching a dizzying peak\u201d, including in Gaza and Ukraine. Artificial intelligence is magnifying opportunities and challenges so quickly to the point that \u201ceven the most convinced followers of digitalization are calling for rigorous regulation,\u201d he observed. Climate disruptions are posing \u201ca real question of survival\u201d, while the revitalization of the General Assembly and Security Council reform are either halted or moving forward too slowly. And despite global consensus, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and other agreements on which much hope had been placed are \u201climping dangerously\u201d, he added.\n\n\u201cIn short, the tools at our disposal to promote the well-being of present and future generations are under-utilized while those oriented towards war are over-exploited,\u201d he said. Calling for renewed multilateralism, he highlighted the special role of the Assembly, as the \u201chighest chamber of representation\u201d. It is the most appropriate forum where delegates can express their concerns and aspirations, \u201cthe challenges and hopes of the nations of the world\u201d, he said. Exhorting all nations \u201cbig and small, rich and poor,\u201d to work together on their common goals, he said sustainable development, shared prosperity and harmony with nature are possible if countries of the world set aside their differences.\n\nCongratulating the President-elect, Assembly President Dennis Francis (Trinidad and Tobago) said Mr. Yang\u2019s \u201cremarkable\u201d career in public life \u201cis testament to a depth of experience and a breadth of vision that are truly exceptional\u201d. As Prime Minister of Cameroon, Chairperson of the African Union\u2019s Panel of Eminent Africans and at the United Nations, Mr. Yang demonstrated \u201cunwavering dedication to the principles of peace, sustainable development and human dignity\u201d, he said. The President-elect\u2019s leadership has also been characterized, he noted, \u201cby a consistent commitment to dialogue, cooperation and inclusivity \u2014 principles that are absolutely essential for guiding the General Assembly\u2019s work\u201d.\n\nUnderscoring that the Assembly remains a \u201cpreeminent and necessary global forum\u201d as the international community navigates multiple complex challenges, he stressed that upholding the principles of multilateralism and international cooperation has never been more vital. \u201cWe must work together \u2014 and much harder \u2014 in solidarity and partnership to address the pressing issues of our time and to ensure that no one is left behind,\u201d he said. Turning to the remaining months of the seventy-eighth session, he urged finalization of the Summit of the Future \u2014 \u201ca landmark event that holds the promise of transformative change\u201d. Its success, he added, depends on the active engagement and commitment of all Member States to a genuine effort to find consensus.\n\nAnt\u00f3nio Guterres, United Nations Secretary-General, also offered his congratulations to the President-elect, noting that he arrives at a challenging moment for humanity, amid raging conflicts, deepening climate catastrophe, rife poverty and inequality, and growing mistrust and division. With the Sustainable Development Goals \u201cdramatically off-track\u201d, developing countries are left without the support they need. \u201cA proud African dedicated to the future of his continent,\u201d, Mr. Yang has a wealth of experience representing his country at the highest levels. African countries like Cameroon are bursting with potential, he said, calling on the international community to rally around them and support developing countries worldwide.\n\n\u201cI look forward to working closely with him,\u201d the Secretary-General said, \u201cas he unites Member States around collaborative solutions that can deliver justice to Africa and the developing world.\u201d He also praised Mr. Francis for his diplomatic skill, stewardship and dedication over the past year. \u201cHe brought the needs of small island developing States to this Assembly \u2014 and so much more,\u201d he said, expressing appreciation for his leadership, including in advancing preparations for the Summit of the Future this September. \u201cAt every step, he championed solidarity and brought this Assembly together at a deeply divided and troubled moment in our history,\u201d he said.\n\nThe representative of Cameroon, speaking on behalf of the African Group, said it is confident that Mr. Yang \u2014 through his academic and professional training, as well as diplomatic and political wisdom \u2014 will successfully lead the work of the Assembly\u2019s seventy-ninth session. Above all, his leadership will shine in \u201cdebates and decisive actions aiming to improve the destiny of countries in conflict or special situations, many of which are in our planet\u2019s southern hemisphere, especially in Africa,\u201d he added. These countries need unfailing support for the transformation enshrined in the African Union\u2019s Agenda 2063. He urged Member States to support Mr. Yang in achieving his objectives.\n\nAlso congratulating the President-elect were the representatives of Yemen on behalf of the Asia-Pacific States, Austria on behalf of the Western European and Other States, and the United States as the host country.\n\nIn accordance with tradition, the Secretary-General drew lots to determine which delegation would occupy the first seat in the Assembly Hall during the seventy-eighth session, with all other countries following in English alphabetical order. Yemen was picked for the first seat and this seating order will be observed in the Main Committees.\n\nThe Assembly then elected the following Vice-Presidents of its plenary: Algeria, Angola, Austria, Barbados, Ghana, Guatemala, Italy, Kyrgyzstan, Madagascar, Moldova, Senegal, Thailand, Tonga, Turkmenistan and Venezuela. Those elected join the five permanent members of the Security Council \u2014 China, France, Russian Federation, United Kingdom and the United States \u2014 which serve annually as Assembly Vice-Presidents.\n\nThe representative of the United States dissociated from the election of Venezuela as Vice-President.\n\nFollowing the meeting, consecutive meetings of the Assembly\u2019s six Main Committees were held to elect their respective Bureaus by acclamation.\n\nThe First Committee (Disarmament and International Security) elected Maritza Chan Valverde (Costa Rica) as Chair; El Hadj Lehbib Mohamedou (Mauritania), Abdulrahman Abdulaziz Al-Thani (Qatar) and Vivica Munkner (Germany) as Vice-Chairs; and P\u0113teris Filipsons (Latvia) as Rapporteur.\n\nThe Fourth Committee (Special Political and Decolonization) elected Sanita Pav\u013cuta-Deslandes (Latvia) as Chair; Sheikh Jassim Abdulaziz J. A. Al-Thani (Qatar), Carmen Rosa Rios (Bolivia) and Hussein Hirji (Canada) as Vice-Chairs; and Makarabo Moloeli (Lesotho) as Rapporteur.\n\nThe Second Committee (Economic and Financial) elected Muhammad Abdul Muhith (Bangladesh) as Chair; David Anyaegbu (Nigeria), Ivana Vejic (Croatia) and Gudrun Thorbjoernsdottir (Iceland) as Vice-Chairs; and Stefany Romero Veiga (Uruguay) as Rapporteur.\n\nThe Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian and Cultural) elected Z\u00e9phyrin Maniratanga (Burundi) as Chair; Nur Azura Abd Karim (Malaysia), Ekaterine Lortkipanidze (Georgia) and Mayra Lisseth Sorto Rosales (El Salvador) as Vice-Chairs; and Mark Reichwein (Netherlands) as Rapporteur.\n\nThe Fifth Committee (Administrative and Budgetary) elected Egriselda Aracely Gonz\u00e1lez L\u00f3pez (El Salvador) as Chair; Surat Suwannikkha (Thailand), Szymon Mateusz Pekala (Poland) and Johanna Bischof (Austria) as Vice-Chairs; and Elaye-Djibril Yacin Abdillahi (Djibouti) as Rapporteur.\n\nThe Sixth Committee (Legal) elected Rui Vinhas (Portugal) as Chair; Ammar Mohammed Mahmoud Mohammed (Sudan), Mat\u00fa\u0161 Ko\u0161uth (Slovakia) and Ligia Lorena Flores Soto (El Salvador) as Vice-Chairs; and Yong-Ern Nathaniel Khng (Singapore) as Rapporteur.\n\nIn the morning, the Assembly in one round of voting elected five non-permanent Council members for two-year terms to replace members whose terms expire on 31 December 2024. They included Pakistan and Somalia to the two seats open for African and Asia-Pacific States; Panama to the single seat open for Latin American and Caribbean States; and Denmark and Greece to two seats open for Western European and other States. Their two-year terms will end on 1 January 2027.",

        "text": "National Enquirer\nAmerican supermarket tabloid published by American Media, Inc.\n\nThe National Enquirer is an American tabloid newspaper. Founded in 1926,[3] the newspaper has undergone a number of changes over the years. The National Enquirer openly acknowledges that it pays sources for tips (checkbook journalism), a common practice in tabloid journalism that results in conflicts of interest.[4] It has also been embroiled in several controversies related to its catch and kill practices and allegations of blackmail. It has struggled with declining circulation figures because of competition from other glossy tabloid publications.\n\nIn May 2014, American Media announced a decision to shift the headquarters of the National Enquirer from Florida, where it had been located since 1971, back to New York City, where it originally began as The New York Enquirer in 1926.[5] On April 10, 2019, Chatham Asset Management, which had acquired control of 80 percent of AMI's stock, forced AMI to sell the National Enquirer.[6][7] This came after Chatham owner Anthony Melchiorre, whom AMI has also relied on for survival, expressed dismay over the tabloid magazine's recent scandals regarding hush money assistance to U.S. president Donald Trump's 2016 campaign and blackmail of Jeff Bezos.[6][7] On April 18, 2019, AMI agreed to sell the National Enquirer to Hudson Group.[8][9] Pending bankruptcy, Chatham would again become the majority shareholder of the paper.[10][dubious \u2013 discuss]\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\nIn 1926, William Griffin, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of William Randolph Hearst, founded the paper as The New York Evening Enquirer, a Sunday afternoon broadsheet newspaper distributed throughout New York City, using money lent to Griffin by Hearst. It made its debut on September 19, 1926.[11] As partial payment of his loan, Hearst asked Griffin to use the Enquirer as a proving ground for new ideas. Hearst took the ideas that worked in his successful publications; the less successful ideas stayed with the Enquirer, and as a result the Enquirer's sales never soared. During the 1930s and 1940s, it became a voice for isolationism and pro-fascist propaganda. The paper was indicted along with Griffin under the Smith Act for sedition by a grand jury in 1942 for subverting the morale of US troops through Griffin's editorials against US military involvement in World War II. The charges were later dropped.[12][13]\n\nBy 1952, when the paper's circulation had fallen to 17,000 copies a week, it was purchased by Generoso Pope Jr., the son of Generoso Pope, the founder of Il Progresso, New York's Italian language daily newspaper.[13] Pope's son Paul alleged that Luciano crime family boss Frank Costello provided Pope the money for the purchase in exchange for the Enquirer's promise to list lottery numbers and to refrain from any mention of Mafia activities.[14]\n\nIn 1953, Pope revamped the format from a broadsheet to a sensationalist tabloid. The paper's editorial content became so salacious that New York Mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. forced Griffin to resign from the city's Board of Higher Education in 1954.[13] In 1957, Pope changed the name of the newspaper to The National Enquirer and changed its scope to national stories of sex and scandal.[13] Pope worked tirelessly in the 1950s and 1960s to increase the circulation and broaden the tabloid's appeal. In the late 1950s and through most of the 1960s, the publication was known for its gory and unsettling headlines and stories such as: \"I Cut Out Her Heart and Stomped on It\" (September 8, 1963) and \"Mom Boiled Her Baby and Ate Her\" (1962). At this time the paper was sold on newsstands and in drugstores only. Pope stated he got the idea for the format and these gory stories from seeing people congregate around auto accidents. By 1966, circulation had risen to one million.[13]\n\nPope pioneered the practice of selling magazines at supermarket checkouts. To gain access to the supermarkets, Pope completely changed the format of the paper in late 1967 by dropping all the gore and violence to focus on more benign topics like celebrities, the occult and UFOs. In 1971, Pope moved the headquarters from New York to Lantana, Florida. In 1974, The National Enquirer began running Bill Hoest's Bumper Snickers, a cartoon series about cars and drivers, collected by Signet into a paperback reprint two years later. The death of Elvis Presley was the first show business news story that provided the Enquirer with ongoing opportunities to investigate offshoots of the breaking story. Items that followed up on Presley's death included a color photograph of his body in an open coffin, a description of nine-year-old Lisa Presley's shock and grief over the loss of her father and reports of his pharmaceutical drug abuse, autopsy results and malpractice claims against the doctor who had supplied him with the drugs. These reports appeared in nearly every issue of the Enquirer for more than two years.[13]\n\nDuring most of the 1970s and 1980s, The National Enquirer sponsored the placement of the largest decorated Christmas tree in the world at its Lantana, Florida headquarters in what became an annual tradition. A tree was shipped in mid-autumn from the Pacific Northwest by rail and off-loaded by crane onto the adjacent base of The National Enquirer property. Every night during the Christmas season, thousands of visitors would come to see the tree. This would grow into one of South Florida's most celebrated and spectacular events. Although tremendously expensive, this was Pope's \"Pet Project\" and his \"Christmas present\" to the local community. The tradition ended when he died in 1988.[15] By this time, The National Enquirer's parent company American Media had acquired publications and companies including Weekly World News, and Distribution Services, Inc. The surviving owners, including Pope's widow, Lois, sold the company to a partnership of Macfadden Publishing and Boston Ventures for $412 million. Soon after, the company bought the publication's main competition, Star magazine, from Rupert Murdoch. The combined interests were controlled by a newly formed company, American Media Inc (AMI). In 1999, the paper relocated south again, but this time only 15 miles to Boca Raton, Florida.\n\n2000s [ edit ]\n\nAnthrax attack [ edit ]\n\nIn 2001 in Boca Raton, Florida, Bob Stevens\u2014a photo editor at Sun, a sister publication under the National Enquirer's parent company, AMI\u2014was exposed to a letter with anthrax spores and was the first person to die as a result of the 2001 anthrax attacks. The entire AMI office complex in Boca Raton was closed, and remained fenced off for two years after the attack; AMI moved its headquarters to another building in Boca Raton.[16][17]\n\nJohn Edwards story [ edit ]\n\nAfter the National Enquirer, led by editor-in-chief David Perel, investigated John Edwards for 18 months it proved that he was having an affair with Rielle Hunter. The Enquirer followed with exclusive after exclusive, including a photo of Hunter pregnant. In August 2008, in an interview with ABC News, former presidential candidate John Edwards finally admitted to having an extramarital affair with Rielle Hunter but denied fathering her child.[18] Edwards had earlier made false denials of the affair which was first reported by the National Enquirer.[19] In October 2007, the publication ran a story about the 2006 affair with Hunter, a filmmaker hired by the Edwards political team, although Edwards dismissed the story as \"completely untrue, ridiculous\" and \"false.\"[20] In July 2008, the publication ran an article claiming to have caught the former North Carolina Senator visiting Hunter, and their alleged illegitimate child at a hotel in Los Angeles.[21] Fox News interviewed an unnamed security guard who claimed to have witnessed a confrontation between Edwards and the tabloid's members of staff.[22] Edwards later finally admitted that he was the father of Hunter's child, after the Enquirer ran a photo of Edwards with the baby.\n\nIn 2010, there was some speculation that the Enquirer might receive a Pulitzer Prize for its investigation of Edwards.[23] Donald Trump said that the paper should be \"respected\" for its investigation, and questioned why it was not given the award.[24] The San Francisco Examiner wrote, \"It galls most mainstream newspaper editors that a tawdry tabloid could be considered for their most vaunted prize. It's like nominating a porn flick for an Oscar.\"[25]\n\nSarah Palin story [ edit ]\n\nThe National Enquirer claimed to have an exclusive account of the pregnancy of Bristol Palin, the daughter of Sarah Palin, then governor of Alaska and Republican candidate for Vice President in the 2008 election:[26]\n\nThe Republican governor's announcement about her daughter's pregnancy came hours after The Enquirer informed her representatives and family members of Levi Johnston, the father of Bristol's child, that we were aware of the pregnancy and were going to break the news. In a preemptive strike Palin released the news, creating political shockwaves.[26]\n\nThe title published an allegation that Palin had an affair with her husband's business partner, Brad Hanson.[27] Answering John McCain's threat of a lawsuit, a spokesman for the National Enquirer, in a statement to The Huffington Post, declared:\n\nThe National Enquirer's coverage of a vicious war within Sarah Palin's extended family includes several newsworthy revelations, including the resulting incredible charge of an affair plus details of family strife when the Governor's daughter revealed her pregnancy. Following our John Edwards exclusives, our political reporting has obviously proven to be more detail-oriented than the McCain campaign's vetting process. Despite the McCain camp's attempts to control press coverage they find unfavorable, the Enquirer will continue to pursue news on both sides of the political spectrum.[28]\n\nMurder of Ennis Cosby [ edit ]\n\nThe Enquirer offered a $100,000 reward for the arrest and conviction of the person who murdered Ennis Cosby, son of Bill Cosby. The paper received a credible tip, which it passed along to LAPD, which converted the tip into an arrest and conviction. David Perel's coverage of the O.J. Simpson case was referred to by The New York Times as the \"bible of the case.\" Perel was editor in chief when the paper's investigative unit, formed under him, discovered and published that Jesse Jackson had fathered a love child during his marriage. In the Cosby case, the LA police, at a press conference, credited the Enquirer with solving the case, saying: \"We have just arrested a suspect for the murder of Ennis Cosby going on information we are very confident about and this is in great part due to help from The National Enquirer.\" David Perel was again the Enquirer editor responsible for offering reward money that led to police solving the murder.[29]\n\n2010s [ edit ]\n\nTed Cruz and Donald Trump [ edit ]\n\nThe National Enquirer enthusiastically endorsed Donald Trump for the 2016 presidential election and published numerous stories promoting his candidacy and denigrating his opponents.[30] During the Republican presidential primaries in March 2016, the title ran a story alleging that \"political operatives\" were investigating whether candidate Ted Cruz, a U.S. Senator from Texas, engaged in extramarital affairs.[31][32] Cruz denied it and said that Trump had used his connections to persuade the Enquirer to publish the story.[32] Trump denied involvement.[33]\n\nThe National Enquirer ran another story in April 2016, suggesting that Cruz's father, Rafael Cruz, knew JFK assassin Lee Harvey Oswald and worked with Oswald in New Orleans a few months before the assassination.[34][35] Trump publicly discussed this story on May 3, 2016 saying to Brian Kilmeade of Fox News that \"His father was with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald's being \u2014 you know, shot. I mean the whole thing is ridiculous\".[36][37] On May 4, 2016 (a few hours after Cruz lost the Indiana primary and withdrew his candidacy) Trump stated that he did not actually believe the story (\"Of course I don't believe that\") but the Enquirer wanted to \"let the people read it.\"[36] Kilmeade has since expressed regret for not following up on Trump's May 3 comment during that interview.[38] On July 22, 2016, Trump again mentioned the magazine in connection with Cruz's father, saying \"I know nothing about his father. I know nothing about Lee Harvey Oswald. But there was a picture on the front page of the National Enquirer that does have credibility.\"[39][40]\n\nDonald Trump sexual misconduct allegations [ edit ]\n\nThe National Enquirer received, and refused to publish a story from Karen McDougal about an alleged affair she had with Trump in 2006 and, in 2016 as his presidential campaign advanced, paid McDougal $150,000 for, among other items, \"exclusive life rights to any relationship she has had with a then-married man.\" The Wall Street Journal said that the tabloid had paid McDougal hush money and was using the purchase and refusal to publish the story to protect Trump (a technique known as catch and kill), an allegation the publication denied.[41] In February 2018, after a similar situation involving Stormy Daniels (not involving the National Enquirer) was confirmed, McDougal confirmed her story to Ronan Farrow for The New Yorker, stating that the National Enquirer had loosened the terms of the contract after Trump was elected but that she was unsure of how much she could discuss under the terms of the agreement.[42] The publication had also paid $30,000 to an employee at one of Trump's hotels who claimed that Trump fathered a child out of wedlock during the 1980s; the payment came in November 2015, before the paper publicly endorsed Trump, and according to reports in The New Yorker, the title's staff was investigating the story and preparing to publish the employee's claims before National Enquirer owner David Pecker personally quashed it.[43]\n\nIn late 2015, the parent company of the National Enquirer, American Media, Inc., paid $30,000 to Dino Sajudin, a doorman at Trump Tower, to obtain the rights to his story in which he alleged Donald Trump had an affair in the 1980s that resulted in the birth of a child. Sajudin in April 2018 identified the woman as Trump's former housekeeper.[44] AMI reporters were given the names of the woman and the alleged child, while Sajudin passed a lie detector test when testifying that he had heard the story from others. Shortly after the payment was made, Pecker ordered the reporters to drop the story.[45] In April 2018, AMI chief content officer Dylan Howard denied the story was \"spiked\" in a so-called \"catch and kill\" operation, insisting that AMI did not run the story because Sajudin's story lacked credibility.[46] CNN obtained a copy of the contract between AMI and Sajudin on August 24, 2018, after AMI had released Sajudin from the contract. CNN published excerpts of the contract, which instructed Sajudin to provide \"information regarding Donald Trump's illegitimate child\", but did not contain further specifics of Sajudin's story.[47]\n\nBrzezinski, Scarborough, and the Trump administration [ edit ]\n\nIn June 2017, Morning Joe hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough stated that senior officials in the Trump administration had tried to blackmail the two of them using the National Enquirer. According to them, the tabloid threatened to publish a smear article on the couple unless the two personally called Trump and begged him to have the story spiked. They refused, and the title (which did not have direct contact with Scarborough or Brzezinski) published the story. The Trump administration also denied the story; Scarborough claims he has saved phone correspondence to the contrary.[48]\n\nJeff Bezos [ edit ]\n\nIn February 2019, Jeff Bezos alleged that the National Enquirer had threatened to publish private messages and photographs belonging to Bezos and his girlfriend, Lauren S\u00e1nchez, if Bezos did not stop The Washington Post, which he owns, from pursuing journalistic inquiries into how the publication obtained those messages and photographs.[49][50][51] Bezos also said that in 2018, the year in which Saudi Arabian officials reportedly murdered Washington Post reporter Jamal Khashoggi, the National Enquirer had published a glossy magazine, The New Kingdom, promoting Saudi Arabia.[52]\n\nNotable stories and lawsuits [ edit ]\n\nIn 1981, actress Carol Burnett won a judgment against the National Enquirer after it claimed she had been seen drunk in public at a restaurant with Henry Kissinger in attendance. The fact that both of her parents suffered from alcoholism made this a particularly sensitive issue to Burnett. The former longtime chief editor Iain Calder in his book The Untold Story, asserted that afterwards, while under his leadership, the publication worked hard to check the reliability of its facts and its sources.[53] The National Enquirer additionally scooped other media outlets during the O. J. Simpson murder trial: when a distinctive footprint from a Bruno Magli shoe was found at the crime scene, Simpson vehemently denied owning such a shoe. The title, however, published two photos showing Simpson wearing Bruno Magli shoes.[54] David Perel was the editor in charge of the paper's Simpson coverage, which was highly lauded by mainstream media. [55][56][57]\n\nControversy over false content arose again for the National Enquirer when a 2002 article alleged that male members of the family of kidnapping victim Elizabeth Smart were involved in what the article termed a \"gay sex ring.\" Subsequently, two reporters from the Salt Lake Tribune were fired after it was learned that they had been paid $20,000 for the story, which they had fabricated.[58] The title threatened to sue the Salt Lake Tribune for making false and defamatory statements about the publication after an editorial had disclaimed the Tribune's involvement. The salacious details of the Smart story were retracted by the publication, and a rare apology was issued to the Smart family. One of the fired reporters acknowledged that his behavior was unethical, but expressed surprise that the story had been taken seriously, stating, \"When I dealt with the National Enquirer, I never dreamed that I was accepting money for 'information'.\"[59]\n\nThe National Enquirer settled a libel lawsuit with the wife of Gary Condit out of court in 2003,[60] and lost a suit brought by actress Kate Hudson in 2006.[61] Also in 2006, the National Enquirer was the first newspaper to reveal that O. J. Simpson had written a book, If I Did It. The story was immediately denied by Simpson's lawyer, but was confirmed by release of the book one month later.[62] In early March 2007, the paper blocked access to its website for British and Irish readers because a story about the actress Cameron Diaz that they had published in 2005 and for which she received an apology had appeared on the site. The apology concerned a story it had run in 2005 entitled \"Cameron Caught Cheating\" which turned out to be false \u2013 an accompanying picture was just an innocent goodbye hug to a friend, not evidence of an affair. Although only 279 British web addresses had looked at the story, it was deemed to have therefore been published in the United Kingdom. British libel laws are more plaintiff-friendly and it is not necessary to prove actual malice for the plaintiff to win.[63]\n\nAlso in March 2007, Tucker Chapman, son of Duane \"Dog\" Chapman, sold a tape to the National Enquirer of his father disparaging his black girlfriend with the use of the word \"nigger\", for which the tabloid paid Tucker an undisclosed amount. The A&E Network canceled Chapman's show, Dog the Bounty Hunter, pending an investigation. On February 21, 2008, A&E Network stated they would resume production of Dog the Bounty Hunter, and on May 14, 2008, announced it would return to TV on June 25, 2008. On January 19, 2010, the Pulitzer Prize Board announced that the National Enquirer is eligible for consideration for the Pulitzer Prize in the categories of Investigative Journalism and National News Reporting. This change is primarily due to the Enquirer's breaking the story of John Edwards' affair with Rielle Hunter.[64] In February 2012, the National Enquirer published a photo of Whitney Houston in an open casket on its front page.[65] The previous week, it had posted an article showing her having collapsed from a cocaine and alcohol binge during her world tour and claiming that she only had five years to live.[66][67]\n\nEditorial changes [ edit ]\n\nIn 1999 AMI was bought by a group fronted by publishing executive David J. Pecker. Funding was diverted from the National Enquirer, once considered to be the company's principal publication, to Star magazine. Editor Steve Coz, who guided the paper through the Simpson case, was fired and replaced by David Perel, who had been the Editor in charge of breaking numerous stories on the Simpson coverage.[citation needed]\n\nThe National Enquirer's circulation for a time fell below 1 million (from over 6 million at its height). AMI brought in around 20 British journalists in early 2005, headed by editor Paul Field, a former executive at the British tabloid The Sun, and relocated the editorial offices to New York for an April 2005 relaunch. The move failed badly and Field and virtually all the British journalists were sacked after a year. The company reappointed David Perel and announced the National Enquirer offices would return to Boca Raton, Florida in May 2006. Circulation numbers then climbed to over 1 million readers again, and according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations reached over 1 million. Perel later moved on to oversee the relaunch of the gossip website Radar Online, and was replaced as editor-in-chief by Tony Frost. In 2014, the publication moved back to New York and Frost was replaced by Dylan Howard.[citation needed] Howard and the National Enquirer parted ways when his contract, which expired March 31, 2020, was not renewed.[68]\n\nOn April 10, 2019, the National Enquirer was said to be up for sale and likely to be sold within days.[69] Chatham Asset Management owner Anthony Melchiorre, whose company acquired control of 80 percent of AMI's stock, expressed disapproval of the Enquirer's style of journalism.[6][7] This confirmed on April 18, 2019, when it was announced that AMI had agreed sell the National Enquirer, and also two other AMI tabloid publications Globe and National Examiner, to Hudson Group.[8]\n\nCheckbook journalism controversy [ edit ]\n\nOn April 22, 2024, former American Media Inc. head David Pecker acknowledged in court that the National Enquirer engaged in the practice of checkbook journalism which involved paying sources for stories, and that he \"told the editors that they could not spend more than $10,000\" and he had final say over celebrity stories.[70][71] He also acknowledged that \"checkbook journalism\" served as part of the editorial philosophy he followed when he ran American Media Inc.[71][70] Pecker also stated that he believed that \"the only thing that is important is the cover of a magazine.\"[71]\n\nSupport of Donald Trump [ edit ]\n\nAccording to reporting in The Washington Post, executives at the National Enquirer sent articles and cover images pertaining to Donald Trump or his electoral opponents to Michael Cohen, Trump's lawyer, prior to their publication.[72] The Post reported that this practice continued since Trump became president of the United States.[72] American Media Inc. denied sharing material prior to publication.[72] Federal prosecutors have subpoenaed American Media Inc. as part of their investigations into Michael Cohen for possible violation of campaign finance laws.[72][73] According to reporting by the Associated Press, during the 2016 United States presidential election, stories that supported Trump or attacked his rivals bypassed the newspaper's standard fact checking process.[74] Trump reportedly suggested stories to David Pecker\u2014sometimes via Hope Hicks and sometimes personally\u2014including a negative story about Republican primary opponent Ben Carson.[72]\n\nWhile testifying during Trump's New York criminal trial in April 2024, Pecker would provide detail on how he offered to deploy the \u201ccatch and kill\u201d scheme to support Trump's presidential campaign, stating that he offered in 2015 to suppress negative stories about Trump and also flag any efforts which were made by women attempting to sell stories about Trump as well.[75] Specifically, Pecker noted how he and staff at the National Enquirer targeted former Trump Tower employee Dino Sajudin, who was trying to sell a story that Trump fathered an illegitimate girl, and sought the name of the maid who Sajudin alleged Trump had the affair with, with a National Enquirer editor agreeing to pay $30,000 for the story.[76] The second \"catch-and-kill\" target would be Karen McDougal, with Pecker stating that National Enquirer editor Dylan Howard got word of her allegation in June 2016, and noted how afterwards, he, Howard, and Cohen conspired to get her to accept a payment of $150,000 in exchange for her story.[76]\n\nDefamatory publications [ edit ]\n\nThe National Enquirer issued a formal apology in the September 2017 edition of their magazine for false statements, defaming Judy Sheindlin of the courtroom series Judge Judy as having cheated on her husband and suffering from Alzheimer's disease along with brain damage. In addition, they apologized to her daughter Nicole Sheindlin for defaming her as having a jail record.[77]\n\n\"Catch and kill\" [ edit ]\n\nOn April 22, 2024, David Pecker testified in court: \"We used checkbook journalism, and we paid for stories\". He said that the editors under him had discretion to spend about $10,000 on a story and that any budget above that would be subject to his personal approval.[78] When Karen McDougal claimed to have had an affair with President Trump, the newspaper coordinated with the Trump campaign to pay McDougal $150,000 to benefit the campaign, effectively turning the payment into a campaign contribution. The National Enquirer publicly admitted to \"catch and kill\" in this instance. The Federal Election Commission fined the newspaper $187,000.[79] Stormy Daniels has also claimed the title was involved in the \"catch and kill\" of her affair with Trump as well. The prosecution of Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen has also involved the purported use of \"catch and kill\" practices by the title.[80][81]\n\nTelevision spin-off [ edit ]\n\nOn August 30, 1999, a television spin-off of the supermarket tabloid was entitled National Enquirer TV and was produced by MGM Television. The series was renamed National Enquirer's Uncovered in season 2 and was cancelled on July 6, 2001.\n\n\"Enquiring minds want to know\" catchphrase [ edit ]\n\nDuring the 1980s, the tabloid's slogan in radio and TV ads was \"Enquiring minds want to know.\"[82] The phrase is also used by Willow Rosenberg in the US TV drama series Buffy the Vampire Slayer.[83] In the song \"Midnight Star\" from his album \"Weird Al\" Yankovic in 3-D, \"Weird Al\" Yankovic uses the phrase during the song's outro.[84] In 1987, the publisher of the National Enquirer trademarked the phrase, which uses the alternative (and more commonly British) spelling of \"inquiring\".[85]\n\nDocumentaries [ edit ]\n\nThe origin and history of the newspaper and Generoso Pope Jr.'s life are the main subjects of a 2014 documentary, directed by Ric Burns and called Enquiring Minds: The Untold Story of the Man Behind the National Enquirer.[86] A 2019 documentary directed by Mark Landsman, Scandalous: The True Story of the National Enquirer, describes the paper's coverage of topics such as the O. J. Simpson murder investigation, the role of paparazzi in the death of Princess Diana, and the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign.[87]",

        "text": "Kagame critic Diane Rwigara barred from Rwanda presidential race\nKagame critic barred from Rwanda's presidential race\n\nDiane Rwigara says she feels disappointed and cheated by her disqualification\n\n\u201cWhy won't you let me run? This is the second time you [have] cheat[ed] me out of my right to campaign,\u201d she said.\n\nMs Rwigara, who was also disqualified from the 2017 poll, took to X, formerly Twitter, to express her disappointment to Mr Kagame.\n\nOnly Mr Kagame and two other politicians - Frank Habineza of the Democratic Green Party and independent Philippe Mpayimana - were cleared by the electoral body.\n\nDiane Rwigara, an outspoken critic of Rwandan President Paul Kagame, has been barred from standing in next month\u2019s presidential election.\n\nThe 42-year-old, who is the leader of the People Salvation Movement (PSM), had earlier told the BBC\u2019s Newsday programme that she had hoped to be able to stand this time round.\n\n\"I'm representing the vast majority of Rwandans who live in fear and are not allowed to be free in their own country,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cRwanda is portrayed as a country where the economy has been growing. But on the ground, it's different. People do lack the basics of life, food, water, shelter.\"\n\nBut on issuing its provisional list of candidates, the electoral commission said Ms Rwigara had failed to provide the correct documentation to show she had no criminal record.\n\nIt also said she had failed to show she had enough support nationwide to stand.\n\n\"On the requirement for 600 signature endorsements, she did not provide at least 12 signatures from eight districts,\" Oda Gasinzigwa, the electoral commission chief, was quoted as saying.\n\nAnother reason the commission gave was that Ms Rwigara had failed to prove she was Rwandan by birth. She once held Belgian citizenship but surrendered that in 2017 before her last bid to become a candidate.\n\nBut Ms Rwigara has told the BBC that she was born in Rwanda and dismissed all the other grounds for the rejection of her candidacy.\n\nA total of nine applications to stand for president were received by Rwanda's National Electoral Commission. Their final list will be announced next Friday as it still considering appeals lodged earlier in the process \u2013 though at this stage it is too late for the PSM leader to appeal.\n\nIn 2017 she was barred following accusations of forging the signatures of supporters for her application.\n\nMs Rwigara was imprisoned for more than a year but acquitted in 2018 over charges of inciting insurrection and forgery. She said the charges were politically motivated.\n\nIn March, a Rwandan court blocked efforts by prominent opposition figure Victoire Ingabire to lift a ban on her running in the presidential election.\n\nShe was freed in 2018 after spending eight years in prison for threatening state security and \"belittling\" the 1994 genocide.\n\nIn Rwanda, people who have been jailed for more than six months are barred from running in elections.\n\nThe two cleared candidates - Mr Habineza and Mr Mpayimana - were also the only candidates approved to stand against Mr Kagame in the 2017 election.\n\nMr Kagame is running for a fourth term, which could extend his presidency to nearly three decades should he win.\n\nHe won the last presidential election in 2017 with nearly 99% of the vote.\n\nThe 66-year-old president has faced criticism from rights groups for cracking down on the opposition.\n\nBut he has always fiercely defended Rwanda's record on human rights, saying his country respects political freedoms.",

        "text": "Election 2024: Joe Biden Makes the Case for Allies and Alliances\nTime magazine is on a roll. Last month it did a deep dive on Donald Trump\u2019s foreign policy based on two extended interviews with the former president. This week, Time is out with a feature story on President Joe Biden\u2019s foreign policy based on an extended Oval Office interview.\n\nTrump was clearly, and understandably, top of mind for Biden. Four sentences into his response to the first question, which asked whether the United States could still \u201cplay the role of world power that it played in World War Two and in the Cold War,\u201d Biden drew a core distinction with his rival:\n\nI have a fundamentally different view than Mr. Trump has on a range of things. Number one: I really believe that we have a values-based as well as practical-based alliances around the world. And he, Trump, wanted to just abandon them. He says he's practical, one-on-one things he's doing.\n\nBiden returned repeatedly during the interview to the importance of alliances and his efforts to deepen and expand them upon taking office. Biden took credit for making NATO \u201cconsiderably stronger than when I took office,\u201d putting \u201ctogether an Indo-Pacific strategy that is incredibly broad,\u201d persuading Japan to devote \u201c3 percent of its GDP to defense,\u201d and encouraging closer relations between Japan and South Korea. He further argued that because he cultivated America\u2019s diplomatic garden that:\n\nI was able to put together four or five major initiatives in Europe. I put together a Quad that never existed before. I put together\u2014I mean personally put together\u2014worked on it, I put together AUKUS with Great Britain and Australia. I put together an agreement between Japan and the Philippines dealing with making sure that we know the international rules of the road pertaining in terms of air and water and territorial integrity.\n\nThe Water's Edge James M.

Japan\u2019s defense spending as a percentage of GDP stands at just 1.6 percent in 2024. (The Japanese government has pledged to get to 2 percent of GDP by 2027.) Likewise, the Quad\u2014or more formally, the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue involving Australia, India, Japan, and the United States\u2014originated in efforts to respond to the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.\n\nBut the general thrust of Biden\u2019s claims rings true. He has done a lot to repair the damage done to U.S. alliances in Europe and the Indo-Pacific during the turbulent Trump years. And while Biden didn\u2019t create the Quad from scratch, he further institutionalized it, including by organizing the first- ever Quad leaders\u2019 summit. In a nutshell, alliances are critical to U.S. power, and they are stronger than they were four years ago.\n\nThe question is, who is listening to Biden\u2019s pitch for investing in alliances? Given fears that a second Trump presidency would roil U.S. foreign policy even if doesn\u2019t lead to Washington\u2019s withdrawal from the world, the heads of allied governments most certainly are. As Biden noted toward the end of the interview:\n\nThere's not a major international meeting I attend that before it\u2019s over\u2014and I've attended many, more than most presidents have in three and a half years\u2014that a world leader doesn\u2019t pull me aside as I\u2019m leaving and say, \u201cHe [Trump] can\u2019t win. You can\u2019t let him win.\u201d\n\nIt is far less obvious, though, that American voters are listening. It\u2019s not that they are hostile to alliances. Quite the contrary. Most polls show that Americans like having friends and partners and believe the United States should stand by its commitments. It\u2019s rather that alliances\u2014and foreign policy generally\u2014fall way down the list of worries that Americans take with them to the polls.\n\nThat political reality is why most U.S. allies agree with Biden that \u201cAmerica\u2019s back\u201d while also been asking, as French President Emmanuel Macron put it at the 2021 G-7 meeting, \u201cFor how long?\u201d November 5 will provide the answer.\n\nCampaign Update\n\nThe fallout from Trump\u2019s conviction in a New York State court last week on thirty-four felony counts continues to shake the campaign and American politics. Some Republican lawmakers now want the prosecutors pursuing criminal charges against the former president investigated and prosecuted. Trump himself called on the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene in his sentencing hearing, presumably to overturn his conviction:\n\nThe problem for Trump is that the judicial system doesn\u2019t work that way. With a few narrow exceptions that don\u2019t apply in Trump\u2019s case, convictions in state courts can\u2019t be appealed directly to the Supreme Court. They instead need to work their way through a state\u2019s appellate court process. That usually takes time. Trump is almost certain to appeal and has a range of issues he can raise with the New York Appellate Division Court.\n\nWhat the Candidates Are Saying\n\nBiden was in Normandy yesterday to mark the eightieth anniversary of D-Day. He used much of his sixteen-minute speech to hail the bravery of the men who stormed Normandy\u2019s beaches in June 1944, citing the stories of some of the men who returned to the site of their heroism eighty years later.\n\nBiden also used the moment to hail the importance of alliances being in America\u2019s \u201cown self-interest,\u201d to warn against the dangers of isolationism, and to stress the importance of standing by Ukraine:\n\nAmerica\u2019s unique ability to bring countries together is an undeniable source of our strength and our power. Isolationism was not the answer 80 years ago, and it is not the answer today. ... The United States and NATO and a coalition of more than fifty countries standing strong with Ukraine. We will not walk away, because if we do, Ukraine will be subjugated. And it will not end there. Ukraine\u2019s neighbors will be threatened. All of Europe will be threatened.\n\nBiden never mentioned Trump by name. But the former president likely came immediately to mind to those listening to Biden\u2019s remarks.\n\nWhat the Pundits Are Saying\n\nThe Atlantic\u2019s McKay Coppins spoke with European diplomats and dignitaries and concluded that most of Europe views Trump\u2019s election in November as \u201call but inevitable.\u201d They aren\u2019t happy at the prospect. As Coppins put it, \u201cin capitals across the continent\u2014from Brussels to Berlin, Warsaw to Tallinn\u2014leaders and diplomats expressed a sense of alarm bordering on panic at the prospect of Donald Trump\u2019s reelection.\u201d\n\nPolitico\u2019s Elena Schneider, Eli Stokols, and Lisa Kashinsky argued that foreign policy will be a liability for Biden in November. A quote in the piece from an anonymous Democratic strategist summarized their conclusion: \u201cForeign policy is a problem for Biden because it undermines the central tenet of his 2020 candidacy, when he said he would restore America abroad and return us to normalcy.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s David Lynch wrote about how both Biden and Trump want to hike tariffs on Chinese imports while insisting that American consumers won\u2019t have to pay more as a result. \u201cBiden\u2019s tariffs on $18 billion in Chinese electric vehicles, batteries and computer chips, announced last month, are likely too small to lift the economy\u2019s overall price level,\u201d according to the economist Lynch spoke with. \u201cBut Trump\u2019s plan for 60 percent tariffs on all $427 billion in goods that China ships to the United States each year would almost certainly reshape trade in ways that consumers would notice.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times\u2019 Jess Bidgood assessed what Biden\u2019s shift to a harder line on asylum policy might mean for his reelection chances. \u201cIt could be difficult for Biden to make inroads on the border in a polarized country,\u201d according to Bidgood. However, \u201cpolling suggests that Americans are broadly supportive of proposals like Biden\u2019s executive order. A CBS News poll found that nearly two-thirds of Americans want Biden to be tougher on immigrants trying to cross the border. The proposal could also help Biden make inroads with Hispanic voters, three-quarters of whom see the situation at the border as a crisis or a major problem, according to Pew.\u201d\n\nWhat the Polls Show\n\n538\u2019s Nathaniel Rakich reviewed the early polling results on the impact of Trump\u2019s felony convictions on his election chances. \u201cFour pollsters have already conducted national polls of the 2024 presidential election entirely since Trump was found guilty,\u201d according to Rakich, \u201cand a handful more have asked about the verdict but not the election explicitly. They show that Americans are taking the verdict seriously, and it may be giving President Joe Biden a small boost in support. However, it\u2019s still too early to draw any definitive conclusions.\u201d The New York Times\u2019s Nate Cohn and Ruth Igielnik reached much the same conclusion after reviewing conversations with some two thousand participants in New York Times/Siena College surveys conducted in April and May. \u201cThe group favored Mr. Trump by three points when originally interviewed in April and May, but this week they backed him by only one point.\u201d\n\nThe concerns that McKay Coppin found among European elites about the future of the U.S. commitment to the transatlantic alliance are reflected in European public opinion according to a poll by the Institute for Global Affairs (IGA) at Eurasia Group out this week. \u201cOnly 6% of Western Europeans see the US as a \u201cvery reliable\u201d guarantor of European security over the next decade,\u201d according to IGA. \u201cAmericans are about four times as likely as Western Europeans to see the US as a very reliable guarantor.\u201d Mark Hannah, an IGA senior fellow, wrote an article for Foreign Policy highlighting the fact that \u201cnearly three times as many Europeans said they seek a neutral relationship with the United States as respondents who wanted Washington to be primarily responsible for Europe\u2019s defense.\u201d\n\nThe Campaign Schedule\n\nThe first presidential debate is in twenty days (June 27, 2024).\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s sentencing hearing is in thirty-four days (July 11, 2024).\n\nThe Republican National Convention opens in Milwaukee in forty-five days (July 15, 2024).\n\nThe Democratic National Convention opens in Chicago in eighty days (August 19, 2024).\n\nThe second presidential debate is in 102 days (September 10, 2024).\n\nThe first in-person absentee voting in the nation begins in Minnesota and South Dakota in 112 days (September 20, 2024).\n\nElection Day is 158 days away.\n\nInauguration Day is 234 days away.\n\nShelby Sires assisted in the preparation of this post.\n\nThis publication is part of the Diamonstein-Spielvogel Project on the Future of Democracy.",

        "text": "EU elections: What the European results and far-right surge tells us\nFar right makes gains in EU election but it could struggle to unite\n\nSupporters of the French far-right National Rally party react following their victory\n\nIn Brussels, at past EU leaders\u2019 summits, Emmanuel Macron has at times been accused of trying to steal the limelight.\n\nHe certainly managed that on Sunday night. Although probably not in the way he\u2019d have liked.\n\nAs votes for the European Parliament were still being counted, Mr Macron dominated the headlines.\n\nHis drubbing in the poll by French hard-right nationalists had been expected. His decision to dissolve France\u2019s national parliament as a result, came as a shock.\n\nHe had played with the idea last year, after getting trounced in France\u2019s last general election but few expected this move now.\n\nIt\u2019s a huge gamble. From a position of weakness.\n\nEmmanuel Macron describes himself as a centrist and a passionate European.\n\nThis snap general election, taking place in two rounds on 30 June and 7 July, could result in him having to work alongside a French prime minister from the Eurosceptic far right.\n\nMarine Le Pen, regularly portrayed as his political nemesis, declared on Sunday that her party was ready to govern.\n\nIt\u2019s happened before in France that the president, who is the country\u2019s most powerful politician, and the prime minister, hail from different political parties.\n\nBut if the new prime minister were to come from the far right, that would be a first for France.\n\nMarine Le Pen has worked hard in recent years to try to broaden the appeal of her political movement and to soften its extremist image.\n\nShe and her supporters hope this significant victory at EU level (her National Rally party garnered more than double the number of votes of President Macron\u2019s Renaissance party) will translate into huge wins in the snap election back home.\n\nHer dream would be that those successes would then bring her, or her hugely popular prodigee, the 28-year-old Jordan Bardella, a big stride closer to eventually becoming French president - something she\u2019s attempted and failed to achieve a number of times before. The next presidential vote in France is scheduled for 2027.",

        "text": "Trump and Biden neck and neck nationally and in battlegrounds \u2014 CBS News poll\nAmong all the factors on voters' minds this election, former President Donald Trump's guilty verdict pales in comparison to issues like the economy, inflation, and the border \u2014 all items on which Trump maintains advantages. As such, the verdict has not dramatically reshaped the race.\n\nBut what we do see is a few more Joe Biden voters activated out of opposition to Trump. His vote has become increasingly centered around anti-Trump sentiment, more so than affinity for Mr. Biden himself. Today, most of Mr. Biden's voters say their main rationale is opposing Trump, and that's up from March.\n\nWhether that dynamic is enough to sustain Mr. Biden looms as one of the central questions of this campaign \u2014 a contest that today is essentially tied in likely voter preference, both nationally and across the collective battleground states.\n\nAmong Trump's voters, the verdict is a wash. A few say it's a reason to show him support, a few say they're backing him despite it, and the great bulk of them say it doesn't matter either way.\n\nA majority say Trump's conviction is not a factor in their vote decision. In fact, the trial ranks much lower as a factor when considered on its own than every other issue tested.\n\nMost of Mr. Biden's voters now say their main rationale is to oppose Trump, not because they like Mr. Biden \u2014 an increase in this rationale since March.\n\n(Mr. Biden capitalized on this kind of sentiment in 2020 too, as substantial numbers expressed it in many battleground states that year.)\n\nMoreover, we see this dynamic again in how people frame their vote decision, along the lines of whether this election is a referendum or a choice.\n\nWhen people say this election is just about their view on Trump, most vote for Mr. Biden.\n\nHowever, when people instead see this race as a judgment just on Mr. Biden, they vote for Trump.\n\nAnd when they're framing it as a comparison between the two, slightly more are voting for Trump than Mr. Biden.\n\nHere's why that direct comparison right now favors Trump:\n\nTrump outpaces Mr. Biden on a range of qualities like being seen as effective, tough, energetic and \u2014 more narrowly \u2014 competent. Also, more think Trump has a vision of where he wants to lead the country.\n\nMr. Biden does better on personal likability and being viewed as compassionate. But that likability gap does not match vote preferences, because a lot of people who dislike Trump personally are voting for Trump anyway.\n\nAnd here's what partially insulates Trump after the trial verdict: so many of his backers, and Republican base, have seen the charges as not serious and the trial as politically motivated.\n\nIn fact, most Republicans believe that the prosecution in New York was brought on not by decisions by New York prosecutors, but at the direction of the Biden administration. Looking forward, if he's elected, that view may have implications for what they'd want Trump to do in turn. Half of Republicans want Trump to get revenge against his political opponents by investigating and bringing criminal charges against them \u2014 a number that rises among MAGA Republicans.\n\nThe border and immigration\n\nThere's broad support for Mr. Biden's recent executive order dealing with the border, including from most Republicans, but despite that, voters who place a high priority on the border are backing Trump by a large margin.\n\nVoters still tend to think migrant crossings will go down more under Trump.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has talked about the actions he would take toward immigration if elected to a second term, including deportation efforts.\n\nA nearly six in 10 majority of voters say they would favor, in principle, a new government program to deport all undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.\n\n(That isn't purely partisan, it includes a third of Democrats. It rises to nine in 10 Republicans.)\n\nA similarly sized majority would have local law enforcement try to identify those living in the U.S. illegally, and just under half support the idea of setting up large government detention centers to sort out which people ought to be deported.\n\nKey voting groups and rationales: Who is backing who?\n\nViews of the national economy are more negative today than they were in March, and voters' financial concerns continue to lead to more Trump support. This, despite positive macro numbers in the jobs report and stock market.\n\nBut inflation \u2014 likely a proxy term for still-high prices \u2014 continues to affect voters.\n\nTrump is up more than 2 to 1 among those who say higher prices have been a hardship. And Trump leads Mr. Biden big among those who say the economy is a major factor in their vote.\n\nMore continue to think they will be financially better off with Trump in office than with Mr. Biden.\n\nNationally, Mr. Biden's support from some key parts of his base have inched up a bit from March, including women. More women now call abortion a major factor in their vote than they did in March and those that do go big for Mr. Biden.\n\nThe president's support among Black voters continues to lag behind his 2020 performance, but it has improved since the spring. More Black voters now say he fights for people like them than said so in March.\n\nMr. Biden has improved a bit with independents compared to our last national poll in early March. (Given that time frame, it's not precisely clear when that shift may have occurred.) That said, there is some anti-Trump sentiment among the independents now backing Mr. Biden. A larger majority of them are doing so now to oppose Trump.\n\nBut Mr. Biden does not have a meaningful advantage among Hispanics, a group he won handily in 2020. More Hispanic voters think they will be financially better off if Trump wins than if Mr. Biden does.\n\nTrump continues to do well with White voters without a college degree and with older voters, groups that backed him in 2016 and 2020. And despite speculation about the \"anti-Trump\" vote in the GOP primaries, more than nine in 10 Republicans are backing Trump, similar to the number of Democrats who are backing Mr. Biden.\n\nMuch of these same patterns play out across the battleground states.\n\nNationally, Republicans have a turnout advantage helping lift Trump, but in the battleground states, Democrats and Republicans are about equally likely to say they'll definitely vote, perhaps due to campaigns trying to activate their voters there.\n\nThis CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,063 U.S. adult residents interviewed between June 5-7, 2024. The data includes an oversample in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. The sample was weighted by gender, age, race, and education, based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as past vote. The margin of error is \u00b13.2 points among all adults and \u00b13.8 points among registered voters.\n\nToplines",
