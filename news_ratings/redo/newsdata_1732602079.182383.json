        "text": "Biden assures campaign donors he can still win election\nBiden assures donors he can still win election\n\nReuters President Biden and the First Lady arriving in New Jersey for a fundraiser\n\nUS President Joe Biden has assured Democrat donors that he can still win November's presidential election against Donald Trump, after a poor debate performance fuelled concern about his candidacy. The president, 81, attended a series of fundraising events in New York and New Jersey on Saturday, and defended his performance in CNN's Presidential Debate. Speaking at one event, Mr Biden admitted, \"I didn\u2019t have a great night, but neither did Trump\u201d on Thursday. \"I promise you we're going to win this election,\" he said. Mr Biden's debate performance was marked by hard-to-follow and shaky answers - raising fresh fears among some Democrats over whether he is the right candidate to contest this high-stakes election. Former Democratic House speaker Nancy Pelosi said Mr Biden's debate performance \u201cwasn\u2019t great\u201d - while his former communications director, Kate Bedingfield, called it \u201creally disappointing\u201d. Voters in the US have regularly shared doubts about Mr Biden's mental and cognitive health, and early polling after the debate shows the number who doubt his ability to serve as president has only grown. On 9 June, a CBS News poll found that 65% of registered voters said that the president does not have the mental fitness to serve as president. The network released a new poll on Sunday that showed that number had jumped to 72% after his poor debate performance.\n\nBiden campaign chairwoman Jennifer O'Malley Dillon said on Saturday, however, that internal post-debate polling showed \"voters' opinions were not changed\". \"It will not be the first time that overblown media narratives have driven temporary dips in the polls,\" she said. While the Biden campaign has acknowledged that the debate had not gone as they had hoped, it has maintained its stance that the president will not step aside for another nominee. Mr Biden has also said he understands the concerns, but pledged to fight harder. New Jersey's Democratic governor Phil Murphy attended the fundraiser in his state alongside Mr Biden and the First Lady - and told Mr Biden that \"we are all with you 1,000%\". Former President Barack Obama, who remains a popular figure in the Democratic party, said on social media that \"bad debate nights happen\". \"This election is still a choice between someone who fought for ordinary folks his entire life and someone who only cares about himself,\" Mr Obama wrote. Hours after the debate, Mr Trump told his supporters that he considered the debate a \"big victory\" for his campaign. \"Joe Biden's problem is not his age,\" the 78-year-old Trump said. \"It's his competence. He's grossly incompetent.\"\n\nName-calling and insults - key moments from Biden and Trump\u2019s debate",

        "text": "Election 2024 post-debate: The road ahead for Biden and Trump\nFor Democrats, Thursday night's debate was a nightmare. President Joe Biden's performance at the Atlanta face-off, viewed by more than 50 million, sparked a panic, with a flurry of editorials and commentators pleading with the 81-year-old Biden to drop out.\n\nNew York Times reporter Katie Rogers, who covers the Biden White House, said, \"There is an acknowledgment writ large that the president performed badly. It went poorly. It was a bad night. But there have not been any big sit-downs, big soul-searching sessions. It's just right back to work.\"\n\nRogers, who wrote a book that deeply examines the influence of first lady Jill Biden, said she has not picked up on any efforts inside the Biden family questioning whether this run for reelection is worth it. In fact, Rogers says calls for Biden to step aside will likely only strengthen the first family's resolve for him to stay in: \"The naysayers are key to understanding him. I mean, they drive him. They help reinforce his idea of who he is. You can't overcome an obstacle if people don't put it in your way, or life doesn't put it in your way.\"\n\nFor Biden, barreling through a thicket of pain \u2013 be it personal tragedy or political humiliation \u2013 is nothing new. After more than a half-century in Washington, he has endured setbacks time and again, including when many Democrats and pundits counted him out in 2020. Biden, of course, ultimately prevailed in that race, defeating then-President Donald Trump.\n\nThis past week made clear that winning a rematch will be no easy feat. Trump is on the march in the polls, despite making false statements, which he did at the debate regarding January 6th, abortion, and his own record.\n\nFaiz Shakir, a top adviser to Bernie Sanders, who managed Sander's 2020 campaign when the Vermont senator ran against Biden for the Democratic nomination, said that, following the debate, Democrats are more alarmed about Trump's possible return to the White House, despite coming out publicly in support of President Biden.\n\n\"I think there's some degree of trepidation behind the scenes as people line up behind him,\" Shakir said. \"Obviously, President Biden has to make a decision about whether he stays in this race. And I hope he does. And I hope that if he does, he has to make some changes.\"\n\nThink Mr. Biden will be replaced at the Democratic National Convention this August in Chicago? Think again. The president already has won almost all the roughly 4,000 pledged delegates. Unless he withdraws, they are expected to vote for him on the first ballot.\n\nSo, is anybody making credible moves behind the scenes for a possible shake-up of the Democratic ticket? \"No,\" said Shakir. \"There's a lot of people looking ahead four years. At this point, this party is his. This nomination is his. And he's, really, the sole decider of the future course of where he's gonna go.\"\n\nNew Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu supported Nikki Haley in the Republican primary, but has since endorsed Trump. He said, \"For a while, you could make the argument that, you know, 'Boy, it was tough defending Donald Trump as a Republican, that we were gonna get behind him.' But today, it's a much harder thing for Democrats to explain why they would stick to Joe Biden.\"\n\nTrump has his critics, and his challenges \u2013 including a sentencing date in July for his criminal conviction in New York. But Sununu said the Republican Party is largely with him.\n\nAnd after this past week's debate, they are feeling better than ever.\n\nSununu also doesn't believe there is a Democrat who would make a play against Biden: \"No. No one, if they're smart. I think they're gonna have that kind of realization that as much as they want a new candidate, they had their shot. They missed it. They gotta ride it out, hope that there's a second debate, hope that he does much better, hope that Trump creates a bigger problem for himself.\"\n\nThe day after the debate, with his wife at his side, the president sought to reassure Democrats in North Carolina: \"Folks, I don't walk as easy as I used to. I don't speak as smoothly as I used to. I don't debate as well as I used to. But I know what I do know: I know how to tell the truth. I know right from wrong. And I know how to do this job. I know how to get things done. And I know like millions of Americans know: When you get knocked down, you get back up.\"\n\nThe Times' Katie Rogers says for now the Bidens seem convinced he has one more comeback left \u2026 in what is very likely the last campaign of his long career. \"Both of them, when they feel the odds are rising against him, that is when they get feistier,\" she said. \"They view obstacles as part of his long life in politics, almost associate it with his political brand. But age is not an obstacle, it's a reckoner, and it is a different problem than the ones he has faced before.\"\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\n\n\nStory produced by Mark Hudspeth.

Why would you want to \u2014 did they want to replace Trump? Look at all the things \u2014 he\u2019s a convicted felon,\u201d she said.\n\nBrazil added that \u201cthe Democrats need to get together and stick with what they got and try to improve them with what they have instead of trying to replace it. You don\u2019t replace nothing like that.\u201d\n\nBrazil described the debate as \u201chorrible\u201d because \u201cTrump lied when he first opened up his mouth.\u201d\n\n\u201cBiden was trying to tell the truth, but by him being a stutterer and having problem speaking properly, and having a cold, he had a problem delivering his points because he was trying to fact-check Trump on everything,\u201d she added.",

        "text": "Historian who predicted 9 of the last 10 election results says Democrats shouldn't drop Joe Biden\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Allan Lichtman, the historian who has correctly forecast the results of nine out of the 10 most recent presidential elections argued on Saturday that replacing President Joe Biden could cost Democrats the 2024 election.\n\nLichtman, a professor at American University, rejected the growing chorus of political pundits and Democratic activists who have called on Biden, 81, to bow out of the presidential race after his disastrous debate performance last week against former President Donald Trump. The pivotal moment brought fresh questions about Biden\u2019s age and ability to serve a second term.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge mistake. They're not doctors. They don't know whether Biden is physically capable of carrying out a second term or not,\u201d Lichtman said during an interview with CNN of calls to replace Biden. \u201cThis is all foolhardy nonsense.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nLichtman has correctly predicted the outcome of almost every election over the last half century, except for the race in 2000, using a series of 13 historical factors or \u201ckeys.\u201d\n\nDr. Allan Lichtman\n\nThe system includes four factors based on politics, seven on performance, and two on candidate personality. Lichtman said the incumbent party would need to lose six of those actors, or \u201ckeys,\u201d to lose the White House.\n\nThe keys range from whether a candidate is an incumbent president to the state of the economy and the presence of third-party hopefuls.\n\nDebate performance, however, is not one of the factors that determines the outcome of an election, he argued. Lichtman pointed to historical examples, including the 1984 election in which former President Ronald Reagan swept 49 states despite poor debate performances and concerns over his age.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWhen pressed about whether the questions surrounding Biden\u2019s age and mental acuity are \u201cfundamentally different\u201d than his metrics as president, Lichtman doubled down.\n\n\u201cDebate performances can be overcome,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the first sign of adversity the spineless Democrats want to throw under the bus, their own incumbent president. My goodness.\u201d\n\nLichtman has not made his final prediction for who will win the 2024 presidential election.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Historian who predicts elections says Democrats shouldn't drop Biden",

Known for his accurate predictions of the 2008 Great Recession, Trump\u2019s 2016 Election win, and the Covid Crisis of 2020, Rickards now warns of social and economic chaos that could follow this election.\n\nRickards-New\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Rickards\n\n\u201cThe 2024 election is poised to be one of the most tumultuous events in American history,\u201d Rickards states. \u201cWe are facing the potential for a 50% market crash, the collapse of the US dollar, and widespread civil unrest. The time to prepare is now.\u201d\n\nKey points of Ex CIA Rickards\u2019 urgent warning:\n\nElection-Triggered Market Crash: Rickards foresees a massive stock market downturn, with potential losses exceeding 50%, and a significant devaluation of the US dollar. Civil Unrest and Possible Martial Law: His forecast includes a high probability of violent riots and social disorder, possibly leading to the imposition of martial law and temporary suspension of civil rights. Immediate Action Required: Rickards outlines five essential steps Americans should take immediately to protect their wealth and personal safety. Proven Track Record: With a history of accurate predictions, Rickards\u2019 insights and strategies are based on extensive experience and expertise.\n\nThe 2024 Presidential Election could be the \u2018Tipping Point\u2019\n\nRickards outlines several reasons as to why the stock market could fall at any moment following the election.\n\nElection Chaos and Legal Challenges : Rickards suggests that the 2024 Presidential Election could be similar to the 2000 election but on a much larger scale. This could lead to a prolonged period of uncertainty, causing investors to panic and sell off their stocks.\n\nRefusal to Transfer Power and Civil Unrest: If Trump wins the election, but is prevented from taking office by the current establishment, Rickards predicts widespread civil unrest to break out. Violent protests, clashes with law enforcement, and potential declarations of martial law could create tremendous fear and uncertainty, driving a massive sell-off in the stock market.\n\nCollapse of the US Dollar : Rickards foresees a scenario where the political instability resulting from election chaos and civil unrest leads to a loss of confidence in the US dollar. As investors seek safer assets, there could be a rapid devaluation of the dollar, causing a fight from dollar-denominated assets, including stocks.\n\nIncreasing Inflation: We still have an inflation problem. The combination of government spending, policies, and political instability could lead to hyperinflation. Rickards warns that inflation could become \u201c1000 times worse\u201d than current levels, eroding the value of investments and causing a stock market crash as investors try to preserve their wealth.\n\nPolicy and Governance Issues: Rickards notes that we can not continue to sustain the current administration\u2019s policies on immigration and spending. If things remain, we could be headed towards economic instability. For instance, massive government spending could lead to a fiscal crisis, where the government is unable to service its debt, causing a loss of confidence in the financial system.\n\nHistorical Comparison: Rickards being one who successfully predicted the 2008 financial crisis, implies that similar systemic risks are present today. He suggests that underlying economic weaknesses, combined with political instability, could lead to a sudden market downturn similar to the collapse experienced in 2008.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAbout Jim Rickards Jim Rickards is a distinguished lawyer, economist, and investment banker with over five decades of experience on Wall Street and in international finance. He has advised the highest levels of government, including: the CIA, Pentagon, and White House. Jim has also authored several best-selling books on economic policy and financial markets. Known for his accurate predictions of the 2008 Great Recession, Trump\u2019s 2016 Election win, and the Covid Crisis of 2020, Rickards now warns of catastrophic consequences that could follow this election. Take the necessary next steps, NOW Jim has prepared an entire brief on how every American can prepare themselves for the potential economic and social destruction following the upcoming election.

        "text": "Iran Update, July 1, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIran Update, July 1, 2024\n\nAndie Parry, Kitaneh Fitzpatrick, Brian Carter, Siddhant Kishore, Kelly Campa, Katherine Wells, Kathryn Tyson, and William Doran\n\nInformation Cutoff: 2:00pm ET\n\nThe Iran Update provides insights into Iranian and Iranian-sponsored activities abroad that undermine regional stability and threaten US forces and interests. It also covers events and trends that affect the stability and decision-making of the Iranian regime. The Critical Threats Project (CTP) at the American Enterprise Institute and the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) provides these updates regularly based on regional events. Click here to see CTP and ISW\u2019s interactive map of Israeli ground operations. This map is updated daily alongside the static maps present in this report.\n\nCTP-ISW defines the \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d as the unconventional alliance that Iran has cultivated in the Middle East since the Islamic Republic came to power in 1979. This transnational coalition is comprised of state, semi-state, and non-state actors that cooperate to secure their collective interests. Tehran considers itself to be both part of the alliance and its leader. Iran furnishes these groups with varying levels of financial, military, and political support in exchange for some degree of influence or control over their actions. Some are traditional proxies that are highly responsive to Iranian direction, while others are partners over which Iran exerts more limited influence. Members of the Axis of Resistance are united by their grand strategic objectives, which include eroding and eventually expelling American influence from the Middle East, destroying the Israeli state, or both. Pursuing these objectives and supporting the Axis of Resistance to those ends have become cornerstones of Iranian regional strategy.\n\nWe do not report in detail on war crimes because these activities are well-covered in Western media and do not directly affect the military operations we are assessing and forecasting. We utterly condemn violations of the laws of armed conflict and the Geneva Conventions and crimes against humanity even though we do not describe them in these reports.\n\nHardline presidential candidate Saeed Jalili will likely win the Iranian presidential election in the runoff race on July 5. No candidate received the majority of votes needed to win the Iranian presidential election on June 28 and Iran will hold a runoff election between the two most popular candidates\u2014ultraconservative Saeed Jalili and reformist Masoud Pezeshkian\u2014on July 5.[1] Pezeshkian received 10.4 million votes while Jalili received around 9.5 million. The second most prominent hardline candidate\u2014Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf\u2014received around 3.4 million votes in the first round of elections on June 28, which was not enough to compete in the runoff election.[2] At least some Ghalibaf voters will presumably back Jalili in the runoff election, however, giving Jalili a significant advantage over Pezeshkian. Pezeshkian has also struggled to consolidate support among Iranian youth, a key voter demographic for the reformist faction.[3] Pezeshkian is unlikely to garner enough support to win against Jalili, especially since social media users have circulated statements in recent days of Pezeshkian boasting about his role in enforcing unpopular policies such as mandatory veiling.[4]\n\nThe Iranian regime is attempting to frame the July 5 presidential runoff elections as a fair and competitive race, despite Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei indicating a preference for hardline candidate Saeed Jalili. Khamenei has repeatedly expressed concern about low voter turnout rates in recent years and views participation in Iran\u2019s presidential elections as a demonstration of Iran\u2019s democratic legitimacy.[5] Iranian regime officials during this election cycle have attempted to reinforce the regime\u2019s democratic legitimacy by boasting that Pezeshkian\u2019s candidacy illustrated the legitimacy of Iran\u2019s electoral process.[6] Some Iranian university students confronted Pezeshkian in a meeting on June 16, framing his candidacy as an effort on the part of the regime to contribute to an \u201cillusion of democracy\u201d and an attempt by the regime to legitimize the elections.\u201c[7] The June 28 voter turnout rate was nevertheless unprecedently low at 40 percent, with the lowest recorded rates in Kermanshah, Kurdistan and Tehran provinces.[8] It is noteworthy that a significant percentage of anti-regime protests during the Mahsa Amini movement occurred in Kurdistan and Tehran provinces, suggesting continued disillusionment with the Iranian regime in these regions.[9]\n\nKhamenei and segments of Iran\u2019s clerical establishment have indirectly demonstrated a preference Jalili in recent days, making a Pezeshkian win unlikely regardless of how many votes he receives. Khamenei expressed foreign and nuclear policy views on June 25 that closely align with ultraconservative hardline presidential candidate Saeed Jalili\u2019s views, suggesting that Khamenei endorses Jalili.[10] Khamenei also indirectly criticized Pezeshkian\u2019s campaign policies on the same date, making it unlikely that Khamenei will permit him to become president. Segments of the Iranian clerical establishment may also back Jalili. Reformist-affiliated Entekhab News posted a screenshot on July 1 that it claimed showed coordination among Iranian clerics to campaign for Jalili in villages and cities across Iran.[11] Entekhab also circulated reports on July 1 that the influential Qom Seminary in Iran will close this week for its students and teachers to help improve voter turnout. Entekhab suggested that the Qom Seminary closures corroborated reports of clerics campaigning for Jalili.[12] It is likely, if the Qom Seminary closures are indeed connected with reports of clerics campaigning, that students and teachers will disperse to their hometowns\u2014specifically rural areas\u2014to generate support for Jalili. Rural and sparsely populated areas have historically served as a bastion of support for the regime and its hardline policies.[13] Roughly 35 percent of the Iranian population lives in rural areas and political engagement in these areas could furthermore improve voter turnout rates while benefiting Jalili.[14]\n\nThe Supreme Leader will risk further deteriorating regime legitimacy in the unlikely event that Pezeshkian garners enough votes to win the election. Khamenei has criticized Pezeshkian\u2019s policies and echoed Jalili\u2019s nuclear and foreign policies, indicating that Khamenei endorses Jalili over Pezeshkian. It is therefore unlikely that Khamenei will permit Pezeshkian to win, regardless of whether Pezeshkian receives the majority of votes. Raisi\u2019s 2021 election suggests that Khamenei is comfortable engineering elections to advantage his preferred candidate.[15] The Guardian Council denied the candidacies of several prominent politicians in the 2021 elections and Raisi therefore faced no significant competition in the race. It is unclear, however, how Khamenei will advantage his preferred candidate if Pezeshkian is able to generate increased support and win the election this week. The regime engineered the election results between reformist Mir Hossein Mousavi and hardline Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2009, galvanizing a months-long anti-regime protest wave.[16] Khamenei will risk further deteriorating regime legitimacy and possibly kickstarting unrest in the unlikely event that Pezeshkian garners significant support in the coming days.\n\nPalestinian militia groups in the West Bank appear to be strengthening at the expense of the Palestinian Authority. Palestinian militia fighters, Israeli military officials, and Palestinian Authority officials told the New York Times that Palestinian militia organizations control refugee camps in the West Bank by refusing to allow Palestinian Authority security forces to enter.[17] Palestinian fighters have prevented Palestinian Authority officials from entering refugee camps since before October 7, according to Palestinian media.[18] Fighters in Nur al Shams, east of Tulkarm, fired small arms at Palestinian Authority forces in June 2023 when the Palestinian Authority attempted to remove barriers that Palestinian militia fighters had placed at the entrances of the camp to prevent Israeli forces from entering.[19] Palestinian militia control of refugee camps in the West Bank provides a relatively safe area for Palestinian militias to build new capabilities and plan operations against both the IDF and the Palestinian Authority.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority\u2019s inability to exert effective control over refugee camps in the West Bank has significant implications for the post-war situation in the Gaza Strip, if these statements to the New York Times are accurate. The Palestinian Authority remains extremely unpopular, and Hamas will be able to easily justify continued resistance to the Palestinian Authority in the Gaza Strip if the authority assumes control with Israeli backing. A surviving Hamas in the Gaza Strip will attempt to rapidly resume its control over the Gaza Strip and continue its efforts to undermine the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank. Hamas sees control over the Gaza Strip as an interim step to creating an Islamist Palestinian state controlling all of Israel and the Palestinian territories.[20]\n\nThe Iranian-guided effort to establish combined battalions in the West Bank since at least 2022 is almost certainly contributing to the gradual strengthening of Palestinian militia groups in the West Bank. Palestinian militias\u2014under Iranian direction\u2014have created a series of combined battalions in the West Bank since at least 2022, modeled on the Lion\u2019s Den militia in Nablus.[21] The New York Times interviewed a former Fatah militia member who had defected to Palestinian Islamic Jihad and now leads one of these combined battalions in Tulkarm.[22] This battalion includes all Palestinian factions in the area, including PIJ, Hamas, and the al Aqsa Martyrs\u2019 Brigade.[23] Palestinian militias in combined units are able to unify planning and logistics by combining their resources, thus improving the militias\u2019 capabilities and efficiency in aggregate.\n\nIsraeli security measures will likely constrain the groups\u2019 ability to quickly expand their capabilities, however. Israeli counter-smuggling efforts and IDF control over access to the West Bank make it challenging for Palestinian militia groups to successfully access enough materiel to build advanced explosive devices or weapon systems at scale. Israeli security forces have successfully interdicted relatively large smuggling operations throughout and prior to this war.[24] Major Israeli raids also disrupt the activity of nascent militia cells before these cells have time to build large stockpiles of weapons and explosives.[25] CTP-ISW has not observed a major and consistent change in militia capabilities during the war.\n\nIran is likely continuing its efforts to arm West Bank militias by smuggling arms through Jordan into the West Bank. The IDF thwarted an attempt to smuggle handguns and rifle parts into the West Bank from Jordan on July 1.[26] Three smugglers attempted to cross the border from Jordan into the northern West Bank.[27] Israeli border police and the IDF searched the area and discovered three bags containing over 75 handguns and dozens of M16 rifle components, including upper receivers, bolts, and charging handles.[28] Israeli security forces have not apprehended the three suspects at the time of writing.[29] The July 1 smuggling attempt is consistent with other Iranian-backed smuggling attempts.\n\nIran is supplying Palestinian militias with weapons to improve their capabilities and to foment unrest against Israel.[30] Both Israeli and Jordanian police have thwarted numerous attempts in recent months by Iran and its partners to transport small arms, explosives, mines, and rockets across the Jordan-West Bank border.[31] Iranian-backed smugglers often use established multinational narcotics-smuggling networks and routes to smuggle arms from Syria into Jordan.[32]\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) 98th Division continued clearing operations to degrade a reconstituted Hamas battalion and to demolish underground military infrastructure in Shujaiya, Gaza City, on July 1.[33] The IDF re-entered Shujaiya on June 27.[34] Hamas fighters in Shujaiya have targeted Israeli forces with sophisticated weapons, such as explosively formed penetrators, supporting the IDF assessment that the Hamas Shujaiya Battalion has at least partially reconstituted since the IDF last operated in the area in April 2024.[35] The IDF killed Hamas\u2018 Shujaiya Battalion commander and his deputy in December 2023, which led them to conclude the battalion was \u201dsignificantly damaged.\u201d[36] The IDF assesses that Hamas has partially rebuilt its battalion from new recruits and Hamas fighters from other degraded battalions.[37] One element of reconstitution is reorganization, in which a commander redistributes the resources at their disposal to restore attrited units to a minimal level of effectiveness.[38] Building composite units by combining several degraded or combat ineffective battalions is one common way to reorganize a force to be minimally combat effective. Israeli forces operating in Shujaiya have also destroyed weapons productions sites during the past several days of operations, indicating that Hamas\u2019 Shujaiya Battalion is also pursuing small-scale weapons production to replenish its stockpiles and aid in regeneration tasks.[39] CTP-ISW previously observed that Hamas cells have probably established a rear area in Jabalia or northern Shujaiya, from which they can mount attacks on IDF units along the Israel-Gaza Strip border.[40]\n\nThe IDF issued evacuation orders for eastern Khan Younis on July 1.[41] An IDF evacuation order typically means that Israeli forces will enter the area within 24 hours to begin clearing operations.[42] PIJ launched 20 rockets from Khan Younis into southern Israel roughly 10 hours before the IDF issued the order on July 1.[43] The IDF Air Force struck the launch site shortly after PIJ fired the barrage.[44] An Israeli military correspondent reported on June 23 that Hamas is reconstituting its military and governance structures in Khan Younis in the absence of Israeli force presence.[45] The IDF withdrew its forces from Khan Younis on April 7.[46] Hamas is also working to reassert local control in Khan Younis by deploying fighters on the streets, managing local policing, and taking over humanitarian aid shipments.[47] Hamas is restoring its governing organizations as well, which has prompted the IDF to target Hamas officials involved in these activities.[48] Hamas\u2019 reconstitution in Khan Younis is likely driving the IDF to conduct a short-term raid into Khan Younis. An IDF operation into Khan Younis may also target Hamas political and military leadership. CTP-ISW previously noted that the IDF\u2019s decision to withdraw its forces from Khan Younis enabled Hamas militants and political leadership to flee to Khan Younis.[49] Hamas leader in the Gaza Strip Yahya Sinwar is likely hiding in a \u201cvast\u201d tunnel system beneath Khan Younis, according to unspecified US officials speaking to the New York Times.[50] Hamas fighters\u2019 option to move northward contributed to their decision to not become decisively engaged in Rafah.\n\nIranian-backed Iraqi militias threatened to target US interests in Iraq and the Middle East in the event of an Israeli operation into southern Lebanon. The Iraqi Resistance Coordination Committee, a coordinating body comprised of Iranian-backed Iraqi militias, met on June 30 and threatened to target US interests in Iraq and the region and increase the \u201cpace and type\u201d of its operations if Israel launches a major military offensive into Lebanon.[51] Iranian-backed militias initially paused attacks against US forces in the region in February 2024 after IRGC Quds Force Commander Brigadier General Esmail Ghaani traveled to Baghdad and ordered a pause on the attack campaign after a Kataib Hezbollah drone attack killed three US soldiers in Jordan in January 2024.[52] The militias\u2019 announced strategy is partially inconsistent with a Saudi report that alleged Iranian-backed Iraqi militias would intervene in Lebanon by sending fighters and weapons to Lebanese Hezbollah if Israel launches a major military offensive into Lebanon. Both the IRGC and Hezbollah reportedly had reservations against such plans, which is consistent with the long-standing Iranian desire to avoid an overt regional war against the United States and Israel. The militia\u2019s newly articulated strategy is more consistent with the militia\u2019s attacks and involvement in the Israel-Hamas war thus far.[53]\n\nThe Iraqi Resistance Coordination Committee most recently threatened to resume its attack campaign on US forces and interests in the Middle East on June 19, citing the Iraqi government\u2019s failure to establish a timeline for a US troop withdrawal from Iraq.[54] The June 30 Coordination Committee statement citing a possible Israeli offensive into Lebanon as a trigger for new attacks comes after individual attempts by Iranian-backed Iraqi militia groups to resume attacks on US forces.[55] Emirati state media reported that other Islamic Resistance in Iraq militia leaders have disagreed with Kataib Hezbollah\u2019s calls to resume attacks targeting US forces in Iraq since April 2024. Kataib Hezbollah has reportedly begun to \u201dreconsider\u201d its decision to pause attacks.[56] Qais Khazali, who is the secretary general of Iranian-backed Iraqi militia Asaib Ahl al Haq, similarly threatened on June 24 to attack US interests if Israel launched a major military offensive into Lebanon.[57] Such calls appear to encourage action that would disobey the orders from the IRGC Quds Force commander in January to stop attacks.\n\nThe June 30 Iraqi Resistance Coordination Committee statement also identified targeting the under-construction Aqaba-Basra oil pipeline connecting Basra, Iraq to Aqaba port south of Jordan, as a \u201cstarting point\u201d for new attacks.[58] The Coordination Committee claimed that Aqaba-Basra oil pipeline is a \u201dmalicious project aimed at draining Iraqi resources and paving a path toward normalization with Israel\u201d. The pipeline project is strategically important for Iraq as it will offer a key alternative port to Iraq\u2019s currently existing exports terminal, eventually diversifying its export routes and linking Iraq\u2019s economy with those of its Arab neighbors.[59] The Coordination Committee and Iran may assess that this declared strategy of attacking Jordanian targets is less likely to elicit a US response and is therefore less risky than targeting US forces in the region. This lower-risk strategy would also be consistent with the long-standing Iranian desire to keep its militia activity at a level that does not cause the United States to seriously threaten Iranian assets.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\nIran: Hardline presidential candidate Saeed Jalili will likely win the Iranian presidential election in the runoff race on July 5.\n\nHardline presidential candidate Saeed Jalili will likely win the Iranian presidential election in the runoff race on July 5.

Yemen: Houthi media published footage on June 30 of a Houthi attack targeting a bulk cargo carrier with a new model of unmanned surface vessel.\n\nGaza Strip\n\nAxis of Resistance objectives:\n\nErode the will of the Israeli political establishment and public to sustain clearing operations in the Gaza Strip\n\nReestablish Hamas as the governing authority in the Gaza Strip\n\nThe IDF 99th Division continued operations along the Netzarim Corridor, south of Gaza City, on July 1. The IDF 8th Reservist Armored and 3rd Reservist Infantry Brigades have operated from the Netzarim Corridor to target Palestinian fighters and militia infrastructure for the past month.[60] The IDF said on July 1 that the two brigades have killed dozens of Palestinian fighters and destroyed over 100 militia sites near the corridor.[61] An officer in the 3rd Brigade said that the 99th Division is consistently finding evidence of militia activity, such as weapons and explosives, in almost every building its forces enter near the corridor.[62] The two brigades, assisted by Yahalom combat engineers, have also discovered, investigated, and destroyed a 1 km-long tunnel south of Tal al Hawa over the past few weeks.[63] Commercially available satellite imagery indicated that Israeli armor has cleared land north of the Netzarim corridor near Tal al Hawa since June 20. The IDF said that Palestinian fighters used the tunnel to move across the Strip.[64] Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) mortared Israeli forces along the Netzarim Corridor on July 1.[65] The IDF 99th Division directed a strike on a Palestinian fighter who targeted Israeli forces with rocket fire.[66]\n\nIsraeli forces destroyed an underground PIJ rocket factory in Tal al Sultan on July 1. The IDF 89th Commando and 401st Brigades assisted by the Yahalom engineering unit destroyed and raided a PIJ rocket production site underground in Tel al Sultan.[67] The IDF said the site was the largest PIJ rocket and long-range rocket production site found this far in Gaza Strip.[68] Israeli forces engaged Palestinian fighters above and below ground during the raid and demolition.[69] PIJ reportedly produced hundreds of rockets at the site that it used to target Israel over the past several years.[70] The IDF assessed the factory's destruction damaged PIJ's rocket production capability.[71] Israeli clearing operations in Rafah have focused on dismantling Palestinian militia underground infrastructure, such as this underground rocket factory.\n\nPalestinian fighters continued to target Israeli forces operating in several sectors of Rafah on July 1. Hamas detonated a house its fighters rigged to explode targeting Israeli forces inside in eastern Rafah on July 1.[72] The explosion killed one Israeli soldier and injured nine others.[73] Palestinian fighters also targeted Israeli forces in western and central Rafah.[74] Local Palestinian reports indicated Israeli armor continues to hold positions along the Philadelphi corridor, which is consistent with the IDF\u2019s plan to maintain operational control of the corridor to prevent Hamas from being resupplied with weapons from Egypt.[75]\n\nShin Bet released Hamas-affiliated director of al Shifa Hospital from detention in Israel on July 1.[76] Shin Bet released 55 Palestinian detainees it deemed \u201cleast dangerous\u201d due to a lack of space in Israeli detention facilities.[77] Al Shifa Hospital Director Mohamed Abu Salmiya was one of those released. Israeli forces detained Abu Salmiya in Gaza City on the grounds that he allowed Hamas to use the hospital as a command headquarters.[78] Israel said that the director allowed Hamas to use the hospital\u2019s electricity to strengthen the underground tunnel network.[79] The Israeli defense minister and prime minster both condemned Shin Bet\u2019s decision to release Abu Salmiya.[80] Shin Bet directly blamed Israeli National Security Minister Ben Gvir\u2019s policies for the overcrowded conditions at Israeli detention facilitates that necessitated the July 1 release.[81] Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu called for in immediate inquiry into the hospital director\u2019s release.[82]\n\nPalestinian militias launched two rocket barrages targeting eight Israeli towns and military sites near the Gaza Strip on July 1.[83]\n\nRecorded reports of attacks; CTP-ISW cannot independently verify impact.\n\nWest Bank\n\nAxis of Resistance objectives:\n\nEstablish the West Bank as a viable front against Israel\n\nIsraeli forces have engaged Palestinian fighters in at least two locations since CTP-ISW's last data cut-off on June 30.[84] Hamas, the al Aqsa Martyrs\u2019 Brigades, and Palestinian Islamic Jihad fired small arms and detonated improvised explosive devices (IED) in separate attacks targeting Israeli forces conducting a raid in Tulkarm.[85]\n\nThis map is not an exhaustive depiction of clashes and demonstrations in the West Bank.\n\nSouthern Lebanon and Golan Heights\n\nAxis of Resistance objectives:\n\nDeter Israel from conducting a ground operation into Lebanon\n\nPrepare for an expanded and protracted conflict with Israel in the near term\n\nExpel the United States from Syria\n\nLebanese Hezbollah conducted at least six attacks into northern Israel on July 1.[86] The IDF said on June 30 that a Hezbollah drone attack wounded 18 Israeli soldiers, including one soldier with serious injuries.[87] Hezbollah said that the attack targeted the IDF 188th Brigade\u2019s armored battalion at Rawiya barracks in the Golan Heights.[88] The IDF has recently highlighted the difficulties it faces in intercepting Hezbollah drones.[89]\n\nRecorded reports of attacks; CTP-ISW cannot independently verify impact.\n\nIran and Axis of Resistance\n\nThe Islamic Resistance of Iraq\u2014a coalition of Iranian-backed Iraqi militias\u2014claimed a drone attack on June 30 targeting an unspecified \u201cvital target\u201d in Eilat, southern Israel.[90] The IDF has not acknowledged any such attack, and CTP-ISW cannot verify the claim at the time of this writing.\n\nTwo senior IRGC officials and the acting Iranian foreign affairs minister gave statements boasting about Iran and the Axis of Resistance\u2019s ability to destroy Israel, criticizing Israel\u2019s actions in the Israel-Hamas War, and praising Iran and the Axis of Resistance on June 30 and July 1.

        "text": "Increasing numbers of voters don't think Biden should be running after debate with Trump \u2014 CBS News poll\nFor months before the first debate, the nation's voters repeatedly expressed doubts over whether President Biden had the cognitive health enough to serve.\n\nToday, those doubts have grown even more: now at nearly three-quarters of the electorate, and now including many within his own party.\n\nAnd today, after the debate with former President Trump, an increased number of voters, including many Democrats, don't think Mr. Biden should be running for president at all. Nearly half his party doesn't think he should now be the nominee.\n\n(Trump, for his part, does better, but still only gets half the electorate thinking he has the cognitive health to serve.)\n\nThe move came across the partisan board, but it includes a double-digit movement among Democrats, and movement among independents.\n\nGiven that, today nearly three in four voters also don't think Mr. Biden should be running for president in the first place. That's a higher-percentage sentiment than in February, when almost two-thirds said he should not run.\n\nMost voters who say he shouldn't run say it's both about his campaigning and his effectiveness in office, along with his age.\n\nBut Democrats' concerns, when expressed, lean more toward the strategic. They are worried more about his ability to campaign than his decision-making as president.\n\nTrump, by contrast, finds a wide view among Republicans that he should be running.\n\nThat comes as voters widely believe that in the debate, Trump presented his ideas more clearly, appeared more presidential, inspired more confidence, explained his policies better and \u2014quite simply \u2014 won the debate.\n\nThis is the case, despite the fact that voters overall think Trump was not as truthful.\n\nAnd it's relative, of course. There are plenty of voters who think neither candidate did well.\n\nThese views are very similar whether people watched the debate live or just watched highlights or coverage about it, which may speak more generally to the way people get and process information in the modern era.\n\nAnd Mr. Biden has made no meaningful inroads on convincing voters that a second term would make them financially better off: Trump still is seen as better on this measure.\n\nNor has Mr. Biden cast himself as better than Donald Trump at protecting democracy.\n\nWhat now?\n\nAfter the debate, some Democratic officials reportedly said Joe Biden should step aside as the nominee and give another Democrat a chance to run for president in 2024.\n\nThat idea finds resonance with nearly half the nation's rank-and-file Democrats.\n\nThat's related to perceptions of Mr. Biden's health: Democrats who don't think Mr. Biden has the mental and cognitive health to serve are more likely to say he shouldn't be the nominee.\n\nAnd that former number has increased among Democrats. (It's also gone up among independents.)\n\nThe debate has brought the presidential race front and center to the minds of registered voters. Now 59% of registered voters say they are thinking a lot about the presidential race, up from 48% just a few days ago. Interest has risen among Democrats and Republicans alike.\n\nThis CBS News/YouGov survey is based on a national sample of 1,130 registered voters who were contacted between June 28-29, 2024. All respondents participated in an earlier national survey of 1,881 registered voters fielded June 17-21, 2024. The sample was weighted by gender, age, race, and education, based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as past vote and partisan identification and weighted to account for differential response rates. The margin of error for the sample of registered voters is \u00b14.2 points.",

        "text": "James Carville\nAmerican international political consultant (born 1944)\n\nChester James Carville Jr. (born October 25, 1944) is an American political consultant, author and occasional actor who has strategized for candidates for public office in the United States and in at least 23 nations abroad.[1] A Democrat, he is a pundit in U.S. elections who appears frequently on cable news programs, podcasts, and public speeches.\n\nNicknamed the \"Ragin' Cajun\",[2] Carville gained national attention for his work as a lead strategist in Bill Clinton's winning 1992 presidential campaign.[3] Carville also had a principal role crafting strategy for three unsuccessful Democratic Party presidential contenders, including Massachusetts Senator John Kerry in 2004, New York Senator Hillary Clinton in 2008, and Colorado Senator Michael Bennet in 2020.\n\nHe is married to longtime Republican political consultant Mary Matalin.\n\nEarly life and education [ edit ]\n\nCarville was born on October 25, 1944, at a U.S. Army hospital at Georgia's Fort Benning (now Fort Moore), where his father was stationed during World War II.[4] While his mother, Lucille (n\u00e9e Normand), had stayed behind in Carville, Louisiana, where James was raised, she traveled to Fort Benning long enough to have her firstborn son born there. Later, Carville noted: \"We were availing ourselves to free government health services.\"[5] Lucille Carville, a former school teacher, spoke French at home, and sold the World Book Encyclopedia door to door. His father, Chester James Carville Sr., was a postmaster and owner of a general store.[6][7][8]\n\nCarville, Louisiana, on the Mississippi River\n\nCarville, Louisiana, a neighborhood in the city of St. Gabriel, in Iberville Parish, located 16 miles south of the capital city of Baton Rouge on the Mississippi River, was named after his paternal grandfather Louis Arthur Carville, who was once the postmaster.[9] Louis Arthur's mother, Octavia Dehon, was of Belgian parentage and had married John Madison Carville, described in a biography as \"Irish-born\" and a \"carpetbagger.\"[10] Together, they established the general store operated by the family in Carville, in 1882.[11] Carville has seven siblings (Bonnie, Mary Ann, Gail, Pat, Steve, Bill, and Angela.).\n\nAmong Carville's earliest political campaign work was ripping down the campaign signs of a candidate for public office during high school.[12] Carville graduated from Ascension Catholic High School in Donaldsonville, Louisiana, in 1962.[13][7]\n\nHe attended Louisiana State University (LSU) from 1962 to 1966, but did not graduate at that time. In a 1994 feature in Newsweek, Carville characterized himself as \"something less than an attentive scholar. I had 56 hours' worth of Fs before LSU finally threw me out.\"\n\nCarville served a two-year enlistment in the United States Marine Corps, from 1966 to 1968, where he was stationed stateside, at Camp Pendleton in Oceanside.[13] He attained the rank of corporal.[14]\n\nFollowing his military enlistment, Carville finished his studies at LSU at night, where he earned his Bachelor of Science degree in general studies in 1970 and his Juris Doctor degree in 1973.[15] Carville is a member of the Sigma Nu fraternity.[16][17] He later worked as a junior high school science teacher. Before entering politics, Carville worked as an attorney at McKernnan, Beychok, Screen and Pierson, a Baton Rouge law firm, from 1973 to 1979.[13]\n\nPolitical consulting in the United States 1970s to 1990s [ edit ]\n\nCarville was trained in consulting by Gus Weill, who in 1958 had opened the first advertising firm that specialized in political campaigns in the state capital in Baton Rouge.[18]\n\nEast Baton Rouge Parish, 1970s and 1980s [ edit ]\n\nIn a 2012 piece he wrote for Foreign Affairs, Carville described one of his earliest political jobs distributing \"hate sheets\" with negative literature on a political opponent at grocery stores on behalf of Ossie Bluege Brown, during Brown's 1972 campaign for district attorney of East Baton Rouge Parish.[19] Two years earlier, Brown had defended Staff Sergeant David Mitchell, the first of 17 soldiers charged in connection with the deaths of villagers during the M\u1ef9 Lai massacre.[20] Brown's tenure as D.A. was marked by his crusades against narcotics and pornography. In 1973, Brown prevented Baton Rouge theaters from showing Bernardo Bertolucci's X-rated film, Last Tango in Paris, In 1979, Brown blocked the showing of the comedy, Monty Python's Life of Brian. Brown asked Baton Rouge magazine distributors not to offer the March 1977 issue of Hustler, which a state court judge in Ohio ruled obscene.[21]\n\nIn addition to his work as an attorney, in the late 1970s, Carville also worked for Gus Weill and Raymond Strother at Weill-Strother,[22] a Baton-Rouge-based political consulting firm that, over the years, had assisted with electoral campaigns and political messaging for Louisiana governors Jimmie Davis, John McKeithen, Edwin Edwards, and U.S. Representative Otto Passman.[23]\n\nIn the early 1980s, Carville served as executive assistant to East Baton Rouge Parish mayor-president Pat Screen.[24]\n\nIn early 1985, Carville consulted to help Cathy Long win a special election to central Louisiana's now-defunct 8th congressional district, following the death of her husband, Gillis William Long, of Louisiana's Long family political dynasty.[25]\n\nTexas Senate race, 1984 [ edit ]\n\nIn 1984, Carville became acquainted with his consulting partner Paul Begala when Carville managed then-Texas state legislator Lloyd Doggett's unsuccessful campaign for the open Texas Senate seat. Carville helped Doggett, an unabashed liberal and committed enemy of special interests,[26] secure the Democratic nomination in a primary that included conservative U.S. Representative Kent Hance, and centrist former congressman Bob Krueger. During the primary, Carville borrowed a rubber vertebrae exhibit from a friend who was a personal injury attorney and coached Doggett on using it as a prop on the stump to attack Krueger as a political flip flopper, who lacked resolve and \"backbone.\"[27]\n\nDuring the general election, Doggett's opponent, Phil Gramm, leveraged vicious identity-based attacks on Doggett. On one occasion, Doggett returned the small dollar fundraising he received from a gay rights group.[28] Gramm emphasized themes of \"family values,\" including his insistence at a June 1984 prayer breakfast on \"having people who believe in Christianity in charge of government,\" and Carville counter-punched that theme as antisemitic.[29] Doggett was defeated in the general election, polling 2,207,557 votes (41.5 percent), to Gramm's 3,116,348 votes (58.5 percent).\n\nFinding himself out of work after the November 1984 defeat, Carville recalled, \"I was scared to death, I was 40 years old, and didn't have any health insurance, I didn't have any money, I was mortified.\"[30]\n\nPennsylvania gubernatorial election, 1986 [ edit ]\n\nCarville helped Bob Casey Sr. win election as the 42nd Governor of Pennsylvania in 1986. Casey defeated Philadelphia District Attorney Ed Rendell in the Democratic primary in March, 56.5% to 39.6%.[31]\n\nIn the general election, Casey's Republican opponent, Lieutenant Governor Bill Scranton, took the lead in the polls after announcing that his campaign was pulling all negative ads and challenging Casey to do the same. However, the Scranton campaign misstepped by sending a mailer to 600,000 Republican voters that, in addition to a letter from Scranton's father, former Pennsylvania Governor and U.N. Ambassador William Scranton, included a brochure harshly attacking Casey's ethics.\n\nCarville \u2013 who, The New York Times would later write, was brought into the campaign to \"ramp up the aggression level\" \u2013 began to counter, contacting journalists and characterizing the mailer as outrageous. Scranton claimed he did not know about the mailing, so Carville ordered 600,000 blank envelopes, loaded them onto a truck, and dumped them onto a street corner near Scranton's campaign headquarters. Television cameras captured the campaign, asking: \"How could you send out this many envelopes and not know about it?\"[32] Three weeks before the election, a poster appeared statewide, depicting Scranton as a \"long-haired, dope smoking hippie.\"[33]\n\nThe race was virtually tied until five days before the election, when Carville launched the \"guru,\" a TV commercial that portrayed Scranton as having been a regular drug user during the 1960s, also mocking Scranton's interest in transcendental meditation and his ties to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.[34] The image of Scranton as a meditating, long-haired, dope-smoking hippie, with a background of sitar music, was credited with tipping the scales against Scranton in the socially conservative rural sections of Pennsylvania where Carville selectively decided to run the \"guru\" TV commercial.[35] Casey went on to win the election by a narrow margin of 79,216 out of 3.3 million total votes cast, or 50.7% of the vote to Scranton's 48.4%.[36]\n\nKentucky gubernatorial contest, 1987 [ edit ]\n\nIn 1987, Carville worked as a campaign manager to cast Kentucky businessman Wallace Wilkinson as a self-made millionaire anti-establishment gubernatorial candidate.[37] Wilkinson, who had made his fortune in retail, and real estate development, and who was sued for not paying overtime to his employees, and refused to release his tax returns to the public,[38] charged his Democratic primary opponents with wanting to raise taxes, and continually campaigned on creating a state lottery to raise public revenue.\n\nDuring the general election portion of the campaign, on September 25th, 1987, Carville appeared on WLEX-TV's \"Your Government\" public affairs program and implored reporters to look into the background of Wilkinson's opponent John Harper's family, noting: \"there might be problems with some of Harper's children.\"[39] After the incident, Harper confirmed that his son had been shot and killed by Franklin County, Ohio, police during a 1978 pharmacy robbery.[40] Wilkinson won the general election polling 504,674 votes (64.5%) to Harper's 273,141 (34.91%),[41] and, as Kentucky's 57th governor, secured passage of a state constitutional amendment to allow a lottery.\n\nNew Jersey senatorial contest, 1988 [ edit ]\n\nCarville served as campaign manager to New Jersey U.S. Senator Frank Lautenberg during Lautenberg's successful 1988 re-election campaign.[42] Carville and his partner Paul Begala both led Lautenberg's successful campaign against Republican challenger Pete Dawkins, a Brigadier General and former Heisman Trophy winner who had Roger Stone as a consultant.[43]\n\nGeorgia gubernatorial contest, 1990 [ edit ]\n\nGeorgia Governor Zell Miller with President Bill Clinton\n\nIn 1989 and 1990, Carville assisted conservative Democrat and four-term lieutenant governor Zell Miller in winning the state party's gubernatorial nomination in a five-candidate contest that included Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young, then-state senator Roy Barnes, and former governor Lester Maddox.\n\nMiller campaigned on a platform of shock incarceration boot camps for first-time drug offenders, blasted Young for \"an explosion of crime\" in Atlanta, and painted Young with wanting to \"run away from\" the issue of drugs.[44] At Carville's counseling,[45] Miller made a state lottery in lieu of state tax increases a central theme of his campaign.[46] Carville attributed Miller's eleven-point primary victory over Young to the attraction of the lottery issue and its capacity to turn out white suburban voters. \"Zell Miller was able to set the agenda, and the agenda was the lottery\", Carville noted.[47]\n\nMiller won the nominating contest in the August 1990 runoff against Young and later defeated Johnny Isakson in the November 1990 general election. Miller was later a keynote speaker at the 1992 Democratic National Convention and the 2004 Republican National Convention.\n\nTexas gubernatorial election, 1990 [ edit ]\n\nTexas Attorney General Jim Mattox\n\nCarville consulted in 1990 for former Texas Congressman and sitting state Attorney General Jim Mattox, a bare-knuckled political brawler who routinely traveled to Huntsville to attend state executions in Texas, the most active state in carrying out the death penalty. On advice from Carville, Mattox, who was seeking the Democratic gubernatorial nomination that year, based his campaign on the claim that a state lottery would solve Texas' revenue needs without additional state taxes.[48]\n\nWith no facts to support the charge, Mattox also ran a television advertisement accusing his primary opponent, State Treasurer Ann Richards, a recovering alcoholic, of being a cannabis and cocaine user who might falter in fulfilling the responsibilities of being governor.[49][50] In losing the nominating contest to Richards, Mattox gained a reputation as a combative campaigner.[51]\n\nPennsylvania special senatorial election, 1991 [ edit ]\n\nIn 1991, Carville consulted for Harris Wofford in his run for the open U.S. Senate seat left vacant when Senator John Heinz was killed in an April 1991 plane crash. Following the crash, Carville, who was by then a close political confidant of Governor Casey, hatched a plan to offer his appointment of the Senate seat to Chrysler chairman Lee Iacocca, an Allentown native who declined the offer within 24 hours.[52] Attorney and later Pittsburgh Steelers owner Art Rooney II was also considered. Still, Casey ultimately decided to appoint Wofford, then his state Secretary of Labor, to fill the seat, and Wofford faced a special election in November of that year.\n\nAgainst the national backdrop of the first Gulf War, and a dour economy, Wofford's general election opponent, George H.W. Bush's sitting U.S. Attorney General, Dick Thornburgh, was widely seen as a surrogate of the Bush political machine, and the contest was widely viewed as an early referendum on Bush's reelection prospects the following year.[53]\n\nWofford was one of the first whites to graduate from Howard University School of Law, traveled to India and wrote a book on Gandhi, co-founded the Peace Corps, and was arrested at the 1968 Democratic National Convention for disorderly conduct, and was an opponent of apartheid. A philosophical progressive and college president, he had served as an aide to John F. Kennedy,[54] and was a friend and adviser to Martin Luther King Jr.[55] Wofford had the air of an \"anti-politician,\" rumpled in appearance and uncomfortable with small talk, who ran a campaign with themes of economic populism.[56]\n\nThough the issue polled a distant 5th in voter concerns, Wofford eschewed guidance from his consultants in demanding national health insurance be the centerpiece of his campaign. With the assistance of a guild of Philadelphia ophthalmologists, Wofford crafted an impactful slogan: \"If criminals have access to a lawyer, working Americans should have a right to a doctor.\"[57]\n\nDuring the race, Carville helped Wofford craft an aggressive campaign, [58] with television advertisements attacking Thornburgh for taking expensive flights at public expense in government jets to junkets in places such as Hawaii. Another Wofford campaign commercial evoked an anti-establishmentarian air, linking Thornburgh to \"the mess in Washington.\"[59]\n\nIn the months before the election, Wofford overcame Thornburgh's 44-point lead in the polls and defeated him in November, garnering 1,860,760 votes (55 percent) to Thornburgh's 1,521,986 (45 percent).\n\nWofford's surprise victory helped earn Carville national attention, with the Democratic Party now hoping that he could now help the party win the White House in 1992 U.S. Presidential election.[59]\n\nCarville again consulted for Wofford's re-election campaign in 1994 when he was narrowly defeated by Republican Rick Santorum.\n\nLos Angeles mayoral election, 1992\u20131993 [ edit ]\n\nIn late 1992 and early 1993, Carville consulted for San Fernando Valley state assemblyman Richard Katz in his run for the open 1993 Los Angeles mayoral election, which was the first time in 63 years that an incumbent mayor didn't appear on the ballot.[60] Katz ran on a tough-on-crime platform that included gun control, new sales taxes on firearms and ammunition, and selling-off city-owned infrastructure, such as the Ontario International Airport, to pay police overtime, while promising not to raise property taxes.[61] Despite retaining Carville, and spending a million dollars on campaign television commercials, Katz finished behind three other candidates, garnering 46,173 votes, or 9.73% of 474,366 total votes cast in the nonpartisan blanket mayoral primary, and did not advance to the general election.[62]\n\nBill Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign [ edit ]\n\nBill Clinton in October 1992\n\nIn 1992, Carville helped lead Bill Clinton to a win against George H. W. Bush in the presidential election. In crafting an economic strategy for Clinton, Carville reprised the populist rhetoric his client, Pennsylvania Senator Harris Wofford, successfully wielded the prior year, which was distilled into a series of articles Donald L. Barlett and James B. Steele wrote for The Philadelphia Inquirer. The articles were re-printed into book form: America: What Went Wrong? which became a prop Clinton brandished effectively from the stump during a time of economic recession. In bringing in the series of articles from the Wofford campaign, Carville imported an angry left-wing populism as a campaign theme.[63]\n\nOne of the formulations he used in that campaign has entered common usage, derived from a list he posted in the campaign war room to help focus himself and his staff, with these three points:\n\nCarville sought to shield Clinton from Gennifer Flowers' allegations of her extramarital sexual affair, which emerged shortly before the 1992 New Hampshire Democratic primary. Carville alleged that a supermarket tabloid paid Flowers $175,000 for sharing her story, and that \"the mainstream media got sucker-punched\" by her allegations.[65] Carville set out to shame the press, berating reporters with charges of \"cash for trash\" journalism, and noted: \"I'm a lot more expensive than Gennifer Flowers.\".[66] Flowers later brought a civil suit against Carville in 1999 (see below).\n\nIn June 1992, trailing George H. W. Bush and Ross Perot in the polls, Clinton limped toward the national convention, while the Los Angeles riots crowded him out of news coverage.[67] Carville knew he needed to bring Clinton back into the news limelight. He did so by orchestrating Clinton's splashy criticism of hip hop artist Sister Souljah in a prepared speech Clinton delivered at the Rainbow Coalition's June 1992 \"Rebuild America\" conference in Washington, D.C.[68] Sister Souljah had remarked: \"If black people kill black people every day, why not have a week and kill white people?\" Clinton responded in his speech by saying, \"If you took the words, 'white' and 'black' and you reversed them, you might think David Duke was giving that speech.\" Clinton refuted the suggestion that his speech was a calculated attempt to appeal to moderate and conservative swing voters by standing up to a core Democratic constituency.[69] The speech had the effect of opening up a public war between Clinton and Jesse Jackson.[70]\n\nIn 1993, Carville was honored as Campaign District Manager of the Year by the American Association of Political Consultants. His role in the Clinton campaign was documented in the feature-length Academy Award-nominated film The War Room.\n\nAmerican politics during the 1990s [ edit ]\n\nCarville continued to serve the Democratic National Committee in a political capacity during the 1990s, and had an ongoing need to regularly visit the White House to speak with then President Bill Clinton on political matters.[71] Accordingly, Carville was once one of only twenty individuals at the time who was granted a permanent \"Non-Government Service\" security badge, which were used for non-government employees, such as contractors, who needed regular access to the White House grounds. In consideration for the privilege of the permanent pass, the Clinton Administration asked Carville to submit to a full security clearance style FBI background check.[71]\n\nIn response to the 1997 civil lawsuit then Arkansas state employee Paula Jones filed against Bill Clinton over her claims of sexual harassment while attending a conference on official business, Carville infamously remarked: \"Drag a hundred dollars through a trailer park and there's no telling what you'll find.\"[72][73] South Carolina U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham later made reference to Carville's trailer park line during the 2018 Brett Kavanaugh SCOTUS confirmation hearings in reference to Dr. Christine Blasey Ford. During an October, 2018 interview with Michael Smerconish on CNN, on the topic of Graham alluding to Carville's \"drag $100\", Carville remarked that, at the time, \"I was making a joke\", and added \"I'm always complimented when people use my lines; you always like to leave a little legacy out there.\"[74]\n\nIn 1999, Gennifer Flowers, who had previously alleged an affair with Carville's 1992 client Bill Clinton, sued Carville and his colleague George Stephanopoulos for defamation of character. In 2000, Flowers additionally named Hillary Clinton as a defendant in the suit.[75] Attorney Larry Klayman of Judicial Watch, a conservative advocacy organization, represented her in the suit.[76] Flowers contended that Carville and Stephanopoulos ignored obvious warning signs that news media reporting did not conclusively determine that tapes of her recorded telephone conversations with Clinton were \"doctored.\"[77] In 2004, a federal district court dismissed the case with summary judgment.[77] Klayman then appealed the case on Flowers' behalf.[78] In 2006, 14 years after the allegations of the affair became an issue for Bill Clinton's first presidential campaign, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit affirmed the lower court's dismissal.[79]\n\nInternational elections 1990s to 2010s [ edit ]\n\nBeginning in the mid-1990s, Carville worked on a number of election campaigns abroad, including those of Tony Blair, then Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, during the 2001 general election (in which Blair was comfortably re-elected), and with the Liberal Party of Canada.\n\nCarville viewed working campaigns abroad as more commercially lucrative, and with less reputational risk than campaigns in the United States noting in 2009: \"If you help elect a president and then you get involved in a governor's race and you lose, it's going to be a little bit damaging to your reputation. But if you go to Peru and you run a presidential race and you lose, no one knows or cares. So why go to New Jersey and lose for 100 grand when you can go to Peru and lose for a million?\" [80]\n\nCarville has been less forthcoming to the news media about his work abroad, and remarked to a Los Angeles Times reporter in 1999, \"I won't comment on anything I do outside the U.S.\"[81]\n\nWork with U.S. State Department [ edit ]\n\nIn 2002, on behalf of the U.S. State Department, Carville, and his wife, political consultant Mary Matalin, met with a group of 55 Arab women political leaders during the 2002 United States midterm elections. The programming, \"Women as Political Leaders\" International Visitor (IV) Program\", was the first program implemented under the auspices of the Middle East Partnership Initiative, a collection of 40 programs headed by then deputy assistant secretary for Near East Affairs Liz Cheney.[82] In addition to events with Carville and Matalin, the group met with congressional, state and local campaign staff, and observed campaign work during their visits to Concord, New Hampshire, Dallas, Texas, Detroit, Michigan, Toledo, Ohio, Raleigh, North Carolina, and Tallahassee and Tampa, Florida.[83]\n\nThat year, Carville also proposed visiting Arab and Muslim nations on behalf of the US government to do \"some kind of propaganda,\" adding \"I'd love to use my experience and skills to tell people about my country and what's available to them beyond hopelessness and terrorism.\" He added, \"What the terrorists are after is the younger and increasingly poor population. What they are offering is not that much, but we are not doing a good job telling those young people the other side of the story. It's time we told them about choices they have without imposing American values.\" [84]\n\nGreece, 1993 [ edit ]\n\nCarville, Begala, and Mary Matalin advised incumbent Greek Prime Minister Konstantinos Mitsotakis in an election that saw local Greek press allege United States interference in the election.[85] Unpopular because his program of economic austerity and privatization, Mitsotakis failed in his reelection bid, and lost to democratic socialist Andreas Papandreou.\n\nBrazil, 1994 [ edit ]\n\nFernando Henrique Cardoso\n\nIn 1994, Carville consulted for Fernando Henrique Cardoso in his successful 1994 campaign for the Brazilian presidency.[86] Cardoso, a professor and Fulbright Fellow lectured in the United States during the 1980s at Columbia University on issues of democracy in Brazil. Cardoso, often nicknamed \"FHC\", was elected with the support of a heterodox alliance of his own Social Democratic Party, the PSDB, and two right-wing parties, the Liberal Front Party (PFL) and the Brazilian Labour Party (PTB). During his tenure in office, Cardoso's administration liquidated public assets and deepened the privatization of government-owned enterprises in steel milling, telecommunications and mining, along with making reforms to Brazil's social security income program and tax systems.\n\nHonduras, 1997 [ edit ]\n\nIn 1997, Carville consulted for then leader of the National Congress of Honduras, Carlos Flores Facuss\u00e9, in his presidential campaign.[87] Flores attended the American School of Tegucigalpa, studied international finance at Louisiana State University in the early 1970s, and married a U.S. citizen from Tennessee.[88]\n\nHonduran president Carlos Flores shakes hands with United States president Bill Clinton at Soto Cano Air Base in Honduras.\n\nHe later became the publisher of his family's La Tribuna, a leading Honduran newspaper, and served on various corporate boards of directors, including the Central Bank of Honduras,[89] and became involved in politics. Flores was aligned with former president Roberto Suazo C\u00f3rdova's Rodista faction, the more conservative wing of the liberal party. Vowing to move Honduras past its image of being primarily a banana and coffee exporter, Flores campaigned on his \"New Agenda\" platform, which included a ten-point plan to stabilize the economy. Flores distanced himself from the outgoing Reina administration, while successfully portraying himself as an opposition candidate from the same party.[90]\n\nIn the November 1997 general election, Flores faced National party candidate Nora G\u00fanera de Melgar, the wife of General Juan Alberto Melgar Castro, who seized power in a 1975 coup which removed then president Oswaldo L\u00f3pez Arellano after his bananagate bribery scandal with United Fruit Company.\n\nFlores defeated his opponent by a 10% margin of 195,418 votes out of a total of 1,885,388 votes cast. G\u00fanera de Melgar's campaign was aided by the assistance Dick Morris, a rival political consultant and also a political adviser to Bill Clinton. Morris claimed he had no knowledge of Carville's involvement with his opponent until after the election.[87]\n\nIn October 1998, Hurricane Mitch devastated Honduras, and post-hurricane reconstruction efforts resulted in international development banks' renegotiation of much of Honduras' external debt in exchange for structural adjustment policies. After selling state-owned airports and energy companies, Flores unsuccessfully attempted to privatize Hondutel, the state-owned telephone utility, and when that effort failed, the International Monetary Fund froze the distribution of loans and demanded that the government further accelerate its privatization programs.[91]\n\nEcuador, 1998 [ edit ]\n\nJamil Mahuad Witt\n\nIn 1998, Carville helped to craft a successful strategy to elect Jamil Mahuad Witt as President of Ecuador. Mahuad, an Ecuadorian-born attorney, earned a Master of Public Administration from Harvard Kennedy School, where he was Mason Fellow.[92] He was also a US State Department-sponsored Fulbright Fellow,[93] who lectured in ethics and politics at several universities.\n\nMahuad was elected Mayor of Quito in the 1990s before retaining the services of Carville to help him win the Ecuadorian presidency,[94][95][96] in a campaign in which Mahuad touted his educational background at Harvard Kennendy School.\n\nIn the wake of an economic crisis from falling oil prices and stagnant economic growth, Mahuad decreed a state of emergency, and embarked on austerity measures to stifle rampant inflation, including sales tax and gasoline tax increases, freezing bank account withdrawals, and the dollarization of the economy which included the sudden voiding and invalidation of the sucre, Ecuador's currency since 1884.[97] In January 2000, Mahuad was forced from office in a military coup following demonstrations by Ecuadorians.[98] Mahuad fled to exile in the United States. In 2014, an Ecuadorian court convicted Mahuad, in absentia, of embezzlement during his time in office, and sentenced him to twelve years in prison.[99] Interpol also issued a warrant for his arrest. [100]\n\nPanama, 1998 [ edit ]\n\nErnesto Perez Balladares\n\nIn 1998, the Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) party in Panama retained Carville as their main adviser to help re-elect then term-limited President Ernesto P\u00e9rez Balladares during an election where opposition figures suggested that Perez Balladares was hoping to convey the impression that the Clinton Administration in the United States secretly favored a second term for him.[101] P\u00e9rez Balladares, who attended college in the United States at the University of Notre Dame before attaining his Master's at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania,[102] reformed Panama's Labor Code, privatized Panama's telephone and electrical utilities, and ushered Panama into the World Trade Organization during his tenure.[103] Despite massive spending by the PRD, including the hiring of Carville to craft an effective political strategy, the proposal to lift his term limitation was defeated by a margin of almost 2 to 1.[104]\n\nEhud Barak with PLO chairman Yasser Arafat, and United States president Bill Clinton\n\nAt the suggestion of President Clinton, who had grown frustrated with Benjamin Netanyahu's intransigence in the peace process, Carville, along with colleagues Bob Shrum, a speechwriter for President Clinton, and Stanley Greenberg, consulted in late 1998 and early 1999 for Labor Party candidate Ehud Barak to help him prepare for the 1999 prime ministerial election.\n\nCarville and colleagues endeavored to help Barak seize control of the daily debate, and boost his struggling challenge to incumbent head-of-state Binyamin Netanyahu. Short declarative sentences, sound bites, rapid response, repetition, wedge issues, ethnic exploitation, nightly polling, negative research, searing attack advertisements on television, all familiar tools of American politics, arrived on the Israeli political scene during the election, as a part of what Netanyahu's director of communications, David Bar-Illan characterized as an Americanization of the election, and Netanyahu advisers implying White House meddling in an Israeli election.[105] Barak won election by a double digit margin and served for over two years, before calling a special prime ministerial election in 2001.\n\nArgentina, 1999 [ edit ]\n\nCarville consulted for Buenos Aires Province Governor Eduardo Duhalde in his 1999 run for president of Argentina as the Justicialist Party nominee. Carville remarked in May, 1999 that U.S. Ambassador to Argentina James Cheek introduced him to Duhalde in January, 1998.[106] Carville's consulting fee ran $30,000 per month, in 1999 US dollars, added to a percentage of campaign advertisements, plus first class airfare and hotel expenses.[107]\n\nDuhalde spent much of the campaign embroiled in a power struggle with his own party and incumbent President Carlos Menem who was barely dissuaded from running for a third term despite constitutional term limits, and a series of court rulings against him. The contest of campaigns was rather flat; there were no presidential debates, nor large campaign rallies, nor were any major changes in course promised by the frontrunner candidates.[108] Duhalde emphasized his law and order credentials as a campaign theme. One television advertisement for Duhalde's campaign depicted him walking in the woods alone, talking to himself, and bemoaning all the political enemies plotting against him.[109] Carville clashed with Duhalde's public relations team leading up to the election, which lead to his departure.[110]\n\nAgainst an economic backdrop of the Argentine Great Depression, Duhalde lost the October 1999 general election to Radical Civic Union party candidate Fernando de la R\u00faa who enjoyed the strategy and advice of U.S. American political consult Dick Morris (like Carville, also a former consultant to President Bill Clinton). De la R\u00faa would later resign during the December 2001 riots, and the Argentine Congress appointed the governor of San Luis Province Adolfo Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1 as president. When Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1 also resigned, Congress appointed Duhalde, who would serve as president of Argentina from January, 2002 through May, 2003.\n\nBolivia, 2002 [ edit ]\n\nGonzalo \"Goni\" Sanchez de Lozada in 2003\n\nIn 2002, through his firm Greenberg Carville Shrum (GCS), Carville strategized in Bolivia on behalf of Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (MNR) party presidential candidate Gonzalo \"Goni\" S\u00e1nchez de Lozada. The son of a political exile, S\u00e1nchez de Lozada spent his early years in Iowa, studied at the University of Chicago,[111] and spoke Spanish with a midwestern American accent.[112][113] Sanchez de Lozada served as Bolivian president in the mid 1990s, and had a record of using shock therapy, economic liberalization, and privatization. In his 2002 election campaign, he faced the first serious challenge to the hegemony of the established Bolivian political parties in the form of Evo Morales and his left-wing populist and indigenist Movement for Socialism (MAS) party.\n\nCarville helped Sanchez de Lozada run a campaign playbook with a slick media campaign under the slogan \"Bolivia s\u00ed puede\" (\"Yes, Bolivia can\") that featured negative attack ads on his opponents, particularly against Cochabamba mayor Manfred Reyes Villa. In one campaign advertisement, Reyes Villa was blamed for rampant diarrhea in the city's poor children.[114]\n\nSanchez de Lozada garnered a plurality of votes, 22.46%, against Evo Morales second place finish at 20.94%, before coming to power in August 2002 in a coalition government formed with two other political parties.[115] Lozada resigned in October, 2003 and fled to exile in the United States following the 2003 Bolivian Gas Conflict. Carville's work for Lozada in Bolivia was portrayed in the 2005 documentary film Our Brand Is Crisis, which inspired the 2015 narrative form film Our Brand is Crisis.\n\nVenezuela, 2003 [ edit ]\n\nHugo Ch\u00e1vez tours the USS Yorktown cruiser in March, 2002, at Port Willemstad, Cura\u00e7ao, Netherlands Antilles during the 43rd annual UNITAS multi-national naval exercise.\n\nIn early 2003, Carville worked in Venezuela as an advisor to Venezuelan business interests that previously led an economically devastating strike in the spring of 2002 by managers of the national oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA), in an effort to destabilize the government of leftist president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez.[116] In the aftermath of an unsuccessful coup attempt in April 2002, the group sought Carville's assistance in displacing Ch\u00e1vez from office.[117][118][119][120] In a September, 2006 interview that touched on the topic, Carville remarked: \"I've worked in Venezuela and I would be very reluctant to call Ch\u00e1vez a democrat.\"[121]\n\nAfghanistan 2009 [ edit ]\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi with Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani\n\nAfghan presidential candidate Ashraf Ghani hired Carville as a campaign advisor in July 2009. Ghani, who renounced his US Citizenship in order to run for Presidency in Afghanistan,[122] attended high school in the United States in Lake Oswego, Oregon, during the late 1960s, earned his master's degree from Columbia University in 1977, was a Fulbright Fellow in the United States who taught at UC Berkeley, and Johns Hopkins University in the 1980s, and worked as an economist at the Washington, DC-based World Bank in the 1990s.[123]\n\nGhani and Carville met in Washington in the spring of 2009 through mutual friends.[124] Carville would not say whether he was paid to advise Ghani,[124] whereas Ghani claimed Carville volunteered his time.[125] Carville remarked at the time that the 2009 Afghan presidential election is \"probably the most important election held in the world in a long time,\" and he called his new job \"probably the most interesting project I have ever worked in my life.\"[126] When asked about similarities between politics in Afghanistan and politics in Louisiana, Carville responded: \"Yeah, I felt a little bit at home, to be honest with you.\" Carville's objective was to help prevent one of Ghani's opponents, Hamid Karzai from garnering a majority of votes, to force the election into a second round.[127] Ghani garnered just 2.94% of the vote, with Kazai finishing just shy of a 50% majority. After a cancelled run-off election Karzai became president.\n\nColombia 2010 [ edit ]\n\nIn 2010, Carville worked as senior advisor to elect presidential candidate Juan Manuel Santos in Colombia.[128][129] The Colombian-born Santos attended the University of Kansas for undergraduate studies from 1969 to 1973, graduating with a degree in economics and business. He returned to the U.S. as Fulbright visiting fellow at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in 1981,[130] and also earned a master's degree from Harvard Kennedy School in 1981,[131] and lectured as a Nieman Fellow at Harvard University in 1988.[132]\n\nSantos later joined the Washington, DC-based think tank, the Inter-American Dialogue, and served as Colombia's Minister of Trade,[133] and Minister of Finance and Public Credit of Colombia during the 1990s and early 2000s.[133] In 2006, then President Alvaro Uribe appointed Santos as Colombia's Minister of Defence. Santos supervised the military during a period of political tension and military action targeted at the FARC guerrilla group, including a controversial military raid on Ecuador's border,[134] and extrajudicial assassinations during the \"False positives\" scandal.[135]\n\nCarville played a crucial role for Santos, helping him to analyze voter polls, and crafted a winning strategy,[136][137] that included the night-time distribution of pamphlets under the doors of voters' homes predicting the end of popular social welfare initiatives if Santos wasn't elected.[138]\n\nOn June 20, 2010, after two rounds of voting, Santos was elected as President of Colombia and was inaugurated on 7 August 2010 in the midst of a diplomatic crisis with Venezuela.[139] The U.S. State Department remarked in official communications that it was \"pleased\" with the election of Santos, and praised the \"spirited debate\" before the runoff and Colombia's \"longstanding commitment to democratic principles\".[140] In 2017, Santos acknowledged that his 2010 campaign received illegal payments from Brazilian conglomerate Odebrecht.[141]\n\nArgentina 2015 [ edit ]\n\nCarville acted as advisor for Daniel Scioli's 2007 and 2011's campaigns for the governor of Buenos Aires. He also consulted for his unsuccessful presidential campaign in 2015.[142] The election featured allegations of vote-buying, when Scioli's Front for Victory party was alleged to have distributed sacks with bottles of cooking oil, pasta and flour to Buenos Aires voters in exchange for their votes.[143] Scioli was defeated in a November, 2015 runoff election.\n\nJohn Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign [ edit ]\n\nJohn Kerry at a campaign rally in Minneapolis on October 21, 2004\n\nIn September, 2004, after conversations with Bill Clinton, Massachusetts Senator John Kerry engaged the assistance of Carville as an informal adviser to his 2004 presidential campaign.[144] Rival political consultant Dick Morris speculated at the time that Carville and Greenberg, instrumental participants in the Clinton's political machine, infiltrated Kerry's campaign as a way to engineer his defeat and clear a path for Hillary Clinton to run in 2008.[145][146] In the aftermath of Kerry's loss, Carville and colleagues Stanley Greenberg, as well as journalist Bob Shrum, sought to place blame on external events, including news media coverage of the Iraq War, the October, 2004 Osama bin Laden video, as well as Bush's focus on cultural issues.[147]\n\n2000s [ edit ]\n\nCarville after delivering a speech at a Western Association of Venture Capitalists meeting in December 2009\n\nCarville co-hosted CNN's Crossfire along with associate Paul Begala from 2002 until the show's cancellation in 2005. Carville was a CNN contributor until parting ways with the network in 2013.[148] The following year, Carville joined Fox News Channel as a contributor.[149]\n\nIn 2005, Carville taught a semester of the course \"Topics in American Politics\" at Northern Virginia Community College. Among the guests he had come speak to the class were Al Hunt, Mark Halperin, Senator George Allen, George Stephanopoulos, Karl Strubel, Stan Greenberg, Tony Blankley, representatives from the Motion Picture Association of America, and James Fallows.\n\nIn 2006, Carville became a host on a sports radio show, 60/20 Sports, on XM Satellite Radio, with Luke Russert, son of NBC journalist Tim Russert. The show was an in-depth look at the culture of sports based on the difference in ages of the two hosts.\n\nDuring 2006 mid-terms, then Democratic National Committee chair Howard Dean mobilized a Fifty-state strategy. Democrats won control of both houses of Congress for the first time since the 1994 election. For the first time since the creation of the Republican party in 1854, no Republican captured any House, Senate, or Gubernatorial seat previously held by a Democrat.[150] Notwithstanding, after the election, on November 15, 2006, Carville blasted Dean's leadership as \"Rumsfeldian in its incompetence,\" called for Dean's ouster as DNC Chair and his replacement with Harold Ford Jr., and claimed that, with a conventional strategy of piling money solely into close races, Democrats could have picked up as many as 50 House seats, roughly 20 more than they won that year.[151][152] In late November 2006, Carville proposed a truce of sorts.[153]\n\nCarville was the executive producer of the 2006 film All the King's Men, starring Sean Penn and Anthony Hopkins, which is loosely based on the life of Louisiana Governor Huey Long.\n\nIn January, 2009, Carville predicted the execution of a peace agreement between Israel and Syria in the following 18 months, noting it would be a foreign policy priority for the incoming Obama administration.[154] For several months in 2010, then Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu participated in secret, American-brokered discussions with Syria toward a peace treaty based on a full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights. The Arab Spring ensued the following year, and the treaty never came to fruition.[155]\n\nOn March 4, 2009, Politico reported that Carville, Paul Begala, and Rahm Emanuel were the architects of the Democratic Party's strategy to cast conservative talk radio host Rush Limbaugh as the face of the Republican Party.[156] Carville was particularly critical of Limbaugh for saying he wanted Barack Obama to \"fail\".\n\nCarville was a regular contributor with Stan Greenberg to the weekly Carville-Greenberg Memo at The National Memo.\n\nHillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign [ edit ]\n\nHillary Rodham Clinton on the stump in New Hampshire in June 2007\n\nCarville advised Hillary Clinton during her 2008 presidential campaign. In remarks about then rival candidate, Senator Barack Obama, Carville declared in 2007 that Barack Obama was the Democratic candidate \"most likely to explode or implode.\"[157]\n\nOn March 22, 2008, Carville compared New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, who had just endorsed Barack Obama for the nomination, to Judas Iscariot, calling this \"an act of betrayal.\" Carville remarked, \"Mr. Richardson's endorsement came right around the anniversary of the day when Judas sold out for 30 pieces of silver, so I think the timing is appropriate, if ironic,\" referring to Holy week. Richardson had served President Bill Clinton as his Energy Secretary and Ambassador to the United Nations so Carville believed Richardson owed an endorsement to Senator Clinton. Carville also claimed Richardson assured many in the Clinton campaign that he would at least remain neutral and abstain from taking sides.[158] Richardson denied Carville's account, arguing that he had not made any promises to remain neutral. Richardson claims that his decision to endorse Obama was \"clinched\" by his speech on race relations following the swirl of controversy surrounding Obama's former pastor Jeremiah Wright.[159] Carville went on to note, \"I doubt if Governor Richardson and I will be terribly close in the future,\" Carville said,[160] but \"I've had my say...I got one in the wheelhouse and I tagged it.\"\n\nEven as Clinton's campaign began to lose steam, Carville remained both loyal and positive in his public positions, rarely veering off message and stoutly defending the candidate. However, on May 13, 2008 a few hours before the primary in West Virginia, Carville remarked to an audience at Furman University in South Carolina, \"I'm for Senator Clinton but I think the great likelihood is that Obama will be the nominee.\"[161] The moment marked a shift from his previous and often determinedly optimistic comments about the state of Clinton's campaign.\n\nAfter Barack Obama's clear lead for victory in the Democratic presidential campaign on June 3, James Carville said he was ready to open up his wallet to help Obama build a political war chest to take on John McCain in November.[citation needed]\n\n2010s [ edit ]\n\nCarville and former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin at a 2016 Polticon forum\n\nCarville was retained by Palantir Technologies as a paid adviser in 2011, and was instrumental in bringing about Palantir's collaboration with the New Orleans Police Department to quietly deploy predictive policing software in New Orleans.[162][163]\n\nCarville has criticized Obama's political style and demeanor over the years. On November 18th, 2010, Carville spoke to an audience at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast and remarked: \"If Hillary gave up one of her balls and gave it to Obama, he'd have two.\"[164] Carville made a similar remark to political journalist Eleanor Clift during the midst of the primaries in May, 2008, insinuating that Hillary Clinton was a tougher candidate, remarking: \"If she gave him one of her cojones, they'd both have two.\"[165]\n\nIn November 2013, in light of President Barack Obama's declining approval poll numbers, Carville commented \"I think the best thing he can do is take a toke on the mayor of Toronto's crack pipe, because his numbers are about 48.\"[166]\n\nOn October 21, 2018, Carville participated with Fox News pundit Tucker Carlson at the 2018 PoltiCon in Los Angeles in \"A conversation with Eddie Izzard\", an event chaired by the British comedian.[167]\n\nCarville joined the faculty of Louisiana State University's Manship School of Mass Communication in January 2018. His work at the Manship School was supported by philanthropic gifts.[168] He has also lectured in political science at Tulane University.[169]\n\nIn 2019, political pundit Mark Halperin consulted with Carville for his upcoming book, How to Beat Trump: America's Top Political Strategists on What It Will Take. Carville was asked what he would tell Halperin's sexual assault victims, who have expressed disappointment and outrage that so many top Democrats were willing to talk with someone accused of such serious allegations, and remarked: \"I know he's been accused by a lot of people and lost his job. The guy called me and asked me to speak to him on a topic that I obviously care about. And I spoke to him.\"[170]\n\n2020s [ edit ]\n\nMichael Bennet's 2020 presidential campaign [ edit ]\n\nCarville campaigning with 2020 presidential candidate Michael Bennet in New Hampshire\n\nIn January 2020, Carville endorsed Colorado Senator Michael Bennet's ultimately unsuccessful campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination.[171] Carville appeared on stage with Bennet leading up to the 2020 New Hampshire Democratic presidential primary at his political events in the state. Carville remarked of Bennet during the campaign season: \"This is John Kennedy recloned, you can't get any better than this guy!\"[172] Bennet, who leaned hard on Carville's endorsement, garnered 963 votes in New Hampshire, or 0.3% of 300,022 total Democratic ballots cast in a year of record-shattering turnout.[173][174][175]\n\n2020 election cycle [ edit ]\n\nCarville has also entered the podcast business, and, along with Al Hunt hosts 2020 Politics War Room, which purports to offer \"a backstage pass to impeachment and the 2020 Election.\"[176] He continues to make frequent appearances with Brian Williams in MSNBC cable news programming to comment on the 2020 Democratic debates, caucuses and primaries, and the trajectory of the 2020 Democratic nomination and general election.\n\nIn February 2020, Carville suggested jettisoning the Democratic presidential primaries and caucuses, letting House Speaker Nancy Pelosi select the Democratic Party's presidential and vice-presidential candidates, and suggested Mitt Romney should \"resign from the Senate to save the Democratic Party's ass, and run our convention.\" Carville further added he might cast a write in vote for Nancy Pelosi when he votes in Louisiana.[176]\n\nIn February 2020 media appearances and interviews, against a backdrop of presidential candidate Bernie Sanders' rise in the polls, Carville expressed his displeasure at the prospect of Sanders being nominated, branded Sanders as a \"communist\" and pejoratively labeled Sanders' base of support as a \"cult\", warning of the \"end of days\" if Sanders were to win the Democratic nomination.[177][178] Carville used his media appearances surrounding the dustup to rail against the ascendance of progressive populist Democratic policy positions such as student loan debt forgiveness[179] and \"people voting from jail cells.\"[180] Carville also decried banning hydraulic fracking for shale gas.[181]\n\nIn November 2020, Carville predicted that the result of the presidential election would be known by 10 p.m. on election day. After the Associated Press took an additional four days to declare the winner, Politico named Carville's prediction among \"the most audacious, confident and spectacularly incorrect prognostications about the year\".[182]\n\nPennsylvania Senate election, 2022 [ edit ]\n\nIn 2022, Carville led the \"Penn Progress\" Super Pac,[183][184] which spent the entirety of its funds in support of Rep. Conor Lamb's bid for the U.S. Senate seat vacated by retiring senator Pat Toomey.[185] Lamb worked closely with Carville's SuperPac, and participated in donor calls Carville arranged. [186][187]\n\nCarville's Super PAC bankrolled TV ads which sought to portray one of Lamb's primary opponents, Lieutenant Governor John Fetterman as a \"self-described democratic socialist.\" Within a day of airing, PolitiFact and Factcheck.org called the attack ad false,[188] The Philadelphia Inquirer commented that Fetterman had never actually described himself that way,[189] the ABC affiliate in Philadelphia, stopped broadcasting the ad,[190] and Senator Elizabeth Warren called on Lamb to disavow it.[191] Echoing a fanciful attack by Pennsylvania Republican Party chairman Val DiGiorgio, Carville himself re-tweeted news coverage on Fetterman being labeled a \"silver spoon socialist.\"[192][193]\n\nU.S. Presidential election, 2024 [ edit ]\n\nFollowing U.S. President Joe Biden's poor performance during the June 27, 2024 debate, Carville was among those who called for Biden to end his bid for re-election.[194] In an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper on July 1, Carville stated, among other things, \"The country wants something new. Let them have it.\"[195]\n\nCarville's biographical documentary film Carville: Winning Is Everything, Stupid!, which debuted at the 2024 Telluride Film Festival before receiving a theatrical release on October 11, 2024, includes the 18 month period where he persuaded Biden to end his re-election.[196]\n\nPublic speaking [ edit ]\n\nIn 2004, The New York Times noted that Carville was making more than 100 speeches per year to various audiences, including business groups, colleges and universities and Democratic Party fundraising events. Charles Lewis, executive director at the Center for Public Integrity, a Washington research group, remarked that \"No political consultant has carved a space as unique as his.\" Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, said at the time: \"He's become a commodity of himself by design. He's a walking conglomerate.\" Joe Lockhart, a former press secretary to Bill Clinton, characterized Carville as \"a multimedia corporation, and he's been smart about it. He is a model of the future. This could not have happened pre-1992 when campaign consultants were viewed by a small audience. Now they are public celebrities.\"[197] Carville was noted to have been represented exclusively by the Washington Speakers Bureau, with a speaker's fee of $20,500 in 2004 to get him to the podium for an hour, plus first-class expenses and top accommodations.[198]\n\nCommercial endorsements and advertisements [ edit ]\n\nCarville had an array of commercial endorsements, and starred in print media and television advertisements for leading consumer brands including Coca-Cola, Little Debbie snacks, Maker's Mark bourbon, Heineken beer, Alka-Seltzer antacid, American Express credit cards, Nike shoes, the Cotton Council, and Ariba software.[197]\n\nIn 2000, through Bob Chlopak's and Peter Schechter's Chlopak, Leonard, Schechter & Associates (CLS), a Washington, DC-based public relations firm, Carville enjoyed a sponsorship with Playboy media and Captain Morgan rum, which included a trip to Hugh Hefner's Playboy mansion.[199]\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nCarville is married to political consultant Mary Matalin, who worked for Republican George H. W. Bush on his 1992 presidential reelection campaign. Carville and Matalin were married in New Orleans in October 1993. They have two daughters. In 2008, Carville and Matalin relocated their family from Virginia to New Orleans.[200]\n\nCarville has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and has spoken publicly about ADHD for organizations like Children and Adults with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.[201][better source needed]\n\nCarville sold his house in Uptown New Orleans in May 2021. He temporarily relocated to Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, until moving back into New Orleans in June of 2021. Carville still owns his house in Bay St. Louis and frequently visits. In many of his appearances on cable news, he can be seen in his living room there.[202]\n\nPolitics War Room with James Carville & Al Hunt podcast [ edit ]\n\nIn 2019, Carville and Al Hunt launched the podcast.[203]\n\nBooks [ edit ]\n\nPolitics\n\nChildren's fiction\n\nLu and the Swamp Ghost (2004) with co-author Patricia McKissack and illustrator David Catrow\n\nFilm and television appearances [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]",

        "text": "Iran's 2024 election: Will the presidential run-off vote lead Iran back toward the West, or Russia and China?\nOver the weekend, Iranians voted to elect a new president to replace Ibrahim Raisi, who was killed in a helicopter crash in May. At least, some Iranians did.\n\nVoter turnout was barely 40%, the lowest in Iran's presidential electoral history. Millions of Iranians, disillusioned by decades of undelivered political promises, simply stayed home on voting day. When it was all over, neither of the two leading candidates \u2014 the more moderate Masoud Pazeshkian nor hardliner Saeed Jalili \u2014 had won more than 50% of the vote, and the right to claim the presidency.\n\nThat means there will be a second, run-off round of voting on July 5, with only those two men on the ballot.\n\nCBS News senior foreign correspondent Elizabeth Palmer sat down in Tehran after the first round with CBS News' long-time Iran producer, Seyed Bathaei, to discuss the candidates, their ability to improve people's lives, and how they might influence the trajectory of Iran's relations with the West.\n\nWhat follows is a transcript of their discussion, which has been edited for clarity and to remove repetition. You can watch the video of the conversation in the player at the top of this page.\n\nElizabeth Palmer: We're headed for a run-off between the two main candidates from this first round. Tell us a little bit about them \u2014 first of all, Mr. Jalili.\n\nSeyed Bathaei: Well, Mr. Jalili is being called a hardliner. He himself likes to be called a principlist. He was a tough [nuclear] negotiator long ago\u2026 known for his tough stance against the West. So many people believe that if he becomes the Iranian president, then Iran probably will have much more trouble with the West.\n\nPalmer: How does Mr. Jalili propose to fix the economy, if it's not by trying to thaw things with the West and the U.S.?\n\nBathaei: He has promised that they would rely on local resources rather than looking to the West to solve problems, meaning that even if the nuclear deal is not renegotiated, Iran can still get along okay.\n\nPalmer: By being radically self-sufficient? A sort of a 100% made-in-Iran policy?\n\nBathaei: Yes. Also focussing on how Iran now has got many strong, powerful friends \u2014 Russia and China. Iran really relies on these relationships\u2026[which is] being called a pivot to the East.\n\nPalmer: So, Mr. Jalili would be comfortable looking for support from the East, especially Russia and China and in effect turning his back on the West, America and Europe?\n\nBathaei: Iranian officials \u2014 the whole administration \u2014 have said that this is the West's fault, because the West backed away from the nuclear deal, and that the West who was not happy with the results of the negotiations. They say the West was never seriously engaged, economically, with Iran. So, Iran is now looking to the East instead.\n\nPalmer: But the deal did ease sanctions a little bit and life did improve somewhat. How do they explain that?\n\nBathaei: That is the argument of people who are disappointed with the administration, and they want some changes, and this is what Mr. Pezeshkian, the other candidate, the moderate, has promised.\n\nPalmer: Tell us a little bit about him.\n\nPresidential candidates Masoud Pezeshkian and Saeed Jalili attend an election debate at a television studio in Tehran, Iran, July 1, 2024. Morteza Fakhri Nezhad/IRIB/WANA/Handout via REUTERS\n\nBathaei: Mr. Pezeshkian is a long-time member of parliament. A heart surgeon himself, he was for some time the Minister of Health and has promised to repair, as much as he can, the relationship with the West. He believes that rules on many issues people have protested against over the last two years, including the wearing of the hijab, should be eased. Some people believe that he can deliver, but many also think that within the framework of Iran's present constitution, he will not be able to keep many of those promises.\n\nPalmer: What power does the President actually have, given that the big national strategy is set by the Supreme Leader?\n\nBathaei: Well, as you know\u2026., in Iran, a president is almost equal to a vice president in Western democracies. The president can set the tone and has some limited administrative power, but they cannot change foreign policy, for example.\n\nPalmer: Does it matter to the average citizen who the president is? Do you feel it in your life?\n\nBathaei: Well, the nation is divided. Some people think that yes, they matter, because they \u2026[implement] rules and regulations. But maybe those who didn't participate in yesterday's election believe that, no, the president doesn't matter, because nothing will change anyway.\n\nPalmer: Now that this race has been distilled to two candidates, on opposite ends of the spectrum, is it likely to push all kinds of people to the polls for the second round? Those who didn't come out in the first, perhaps?\n\nBathaei: I think that's what both candidates are counting on. But Iranians are so unpredictable, so who knows? Next Friday a lot of people might show up to decide who the next president is, and maybe the result might trigger some changes, even if they're small.\n\nPalmer: Would you say that economic well-being is the number one issue for most voters, many of whom have been burdened by sanctions?\n\nBathaei: Yes, I believe the economy is the most important matter. People who go to the polling stations want to be able to put food on the table, to be able to support their families, to be able to support their children through school. But we also have many young people, intellectuals, university students, who want to have better relationships with the West so that they can go and spend time there, to study or visit their families. They also want hardline rules, like those governing women's dress code and music, to be eased.\n\nPalmer: Those issues are very contentious. As you mentioned, they were at the root of the big uprisings in 2022. Does a president actually have the power to change those things, or to adjust or to lighten the burden of such rules?\n\nBathaei: Well, many people believe so. There are of course things that cannot be drastically changed, even if the president wants to, because of religion. The Islamic Republic of Iran cannot denounce the hijab, for example, but it could definitely change how the laws surrounding it are implemented.\n\nPalmer: Stricter or not so strict, it's a question of degree?\n\nBathaei: Yes, and how people chanting in the streets are treated.\n\nPalmer: So just allowing a little bit of dissent to show, a little bit of the people's demands and dissatisfaction, is something a president could do, as opposed to ordering a harsh crackdown?\n\nBathaei: Yes, I think so. It's not expected that the next president will go and make friends with the U.S. or be an ally with the West, but definitely, the little steps in either direction matter.",

A former Florida police officer who relocated to Moscow is one of the key figures behind it. The following would have been a bombshell report - if it were true. Olena Zelenska, the first lady of Ukraine, allegedly bought a rare Bugatti Tourbillon sports car for 4.5m euros ($4.8m; \u00a33.8m) while visiting Paris for D-Day commemorations in June. The source of the funds was supposedly American military aid money. The story appeared on an obscure French website just days ago - and was swiftly debunked. Experts pointed out strange anomalies on the invoice posted online. A whistleblower cited in the story appeared only in an oddly edited video that may have been artificially created. Bugatti issued a sharp denial, calling it \"fake news\", and its Paris dealership threatened legal action against the people behind the false story. But before the truth could even get its shoes on, the lie had gone viral. Influencers had already picked up the false story and spread it widely. One X user, the pro-Russia, pro-Donald Trump activist Jackson Hinkle, posted a link seen by more than 6.5m people. Several other accounts spread the story to millions more X users \u2013 at least 12m in total, according to the site\u2019s metrics. It was a fake story, on a fake news website, designed to spread widely online, with its origins in a Russia-based disinformation operation BBC Verify first revealed last year - at which point the operation appeared to be trying to undermine Ukraine\u2019s government.\n\nSeveral errors - including spelling mistakes, punctuation and the use of English - were noticed on this fake invoice. But it still spread widely online\n\nOur latest investigation, carried out over more than six months and involving the examination of hundreds of articles across dozens of websites, found that the operation has a new target - American voters. Dozens of bogus stories tracked by the BBC appear aimed at influencing US voters and sowing distrust ahead of November\u2019s election. Some have been roundly ignored but others have been shared by influencers and members of the US Congress. The story of the Bugatti hit many of the top themes of the operation \u2013 Ukrainian corruption, US aid spending, and the inner workings of French high society. Another fake which went viral earlier this year was more directly aimed at American politics. It was published on a website called The Houston Post \u2013 one of dozens of sites with American-sounding names which are in reality run from Moscow - and alleged that the FBI illegally wiretapped Donald Trump\u2019s Florida resort. It played neatly into Trump\u2019s allegations that the legal system is unfairly stacked against him, that there is a conspiracy to thwart his campaign, and that his opponents are using dirty tricks to undermine him. Mr Trump himself has accused the FBI of snooping on his conversations. Experts say that the operation is just one part of a much larger ongoing effort, led from Moscow, to spread disinformation during the US election campaign. While no hard evidence has emerged that these particular fake news websites are run by the Russian state, researchers say the scale and sophistication of the operation is broadly similar to previous Kremlin-backed efforts to spread disinformation in the West. \u201cRussia will be involved in the US 2024 election, as will others,\u201d said Chris Krebs, who as the director of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency was responsible for ensuring the integrity of the 2020 presidential election. \u201cWe're already seeing them - from a broader information operations perspective on social media and elsewhere - enter the fray, pushing against already contentious points in US politics,\u201d he said. The BBC contacted the Russian Foreign Ministry and Russia\u2019s US and UK embassies, but received no response. We also attempted to contact Mr Hinkle for comment.\n\nHow the fakes spread\n\nChicago Chronicle The real Chicago Chronicle (top) had its heyday in the late 1800s. Below, the logo of the fake news site which appeared online in the last few months\n\nSince state-backed disinformation campaigns and money-making \u201cfake news\u201d operations attracted attention during the 2016 US election campaign, disinformation merchants have had to get more creative both in spreading their content and making it seem credible. The operation investigated by BBC Verify uses artificial intelligence to generate thousands of news articles, posted to dozens of sites with names meant to sound quintessentially American \u2013 Houston Post, Chicago Crier, Boston Times, DC Weekly and others. Some use the names of real newspapers that went out of business years or decades ago.\n\nMost of the stories on these sites are not outright fakes. Instead, they are based on real news stories from other sites apparently rewritten by artificial intelligence software. In some instances, instructions to the AI engines were visible on the finished stories, such as: \u201cPlease rewrite this article taking a conservative stance\u201d.\n\nAn example of instructions to an AI program - mistakenly left on a story on one of the fake news sites\n\nThe stories are attributed to hundreds of fake journalists with made-up names and in some cases, profile pictures taken from elsewhere on the internet. For instance, a photo of best-selling writer Judy Batalion was used on multiple stories on a website called DC Weekly, \u201cwritten\u201d by an online persona called \u201cJessica Devlin\u201d. \u201cI was totally confused,\u201d Ms Batalion told the BBC. \u201cI still don't really understand what my photo was doing on this website.\u201d Ms Batalion said she assumed the photo had been copied and pasted from her LinkedIn profile. \u201cI had no contact with this website,\u201d she said. \u201cIt's made me more self-conscious about the fact that any photo of yourself online can be used by someone else.\u201d\n\nJudy Batalion Judy Batalion had nothing to do with the fake news operation, but her photo was one of several that were copied-and-pasted from elsewhere on the internet in order to make the network's reporters seem real.\n\nThe sheer number of stories - thousands each week - along with their repetition across different websites, indicates that the process of posting AI-generated content is automated. Casual browsers could easily come away with the impression that the sites are thriving sources of legitimate news about politics and hot-button social issues. However, interspersed within this tsunami of content is the real meat of the operation - fake stories aimed increasingly at American audiences. The stories often blend American and Ukrainian political issues - for instance one claimed that a worker for a Ukrainian propaganda outfit was dismayed to find that she was assigned tasks designed to knock down Donald Trump and bolster President Biden. Another report invented a New York shopping trip made by Ukraine\u2019s first lady, and alleged she was racist towards staff at a jewellery store. The BBC has found that forged documents and fake YouTube videos were used to bolster both false stories. Some of the fakes break out and get high rates of engagement on social media, said Clement Briens, senior threat intelligence analyst at cybersecurity company Recorded Future. His company says that 120 websites were registered by the operation - which it calls CopyCop - over just three days in May. And the network is just one of a number of Russia-based disinformation operations. Other experts - at Microsoft, Clemson University, and at Newsguard, a company that tracks misinformation sites - have also been tracking the network. Newsguard says it has counted at least 170 sites connected to the operation. \u201cInitially, the operation seemed small,\u201d said McKenzie Sadeghi, Newsguard\u2019s AI and foreign influence editor. \u201cAs each week passed it seemed to be growing significantly in terms of size and reach. People in Russia would regularly cite and boost these narratives, via Russian state TV, Kremlin officials and Kremlin influencers. \u201cThere's about a new narrative originating from this network almost every week or two,\u201d she said.\n\nMaking the fake appear real\n\nTo further bolster the credibility of the fake stories, operatives create YouTube videos, often featuring people who claim to be \u201cwhistleblowers\u201d or \u201cindependent journalists\u201d. In some cases the videos are narrated by actors \u2013 in others it appears they are AI-generated voices. Several of the videos appear to be shot against a similar-looking background, further suggesting a co-ordinated effort to spread fake news stories. The videos aren\u2019t themselves meant to go viral, and have very few views on YouTube. Instead, the videos are quoted as \u201csources\u201d and cited in text stories on the fake newspaper websites.\n\nYouTube The fake YouTube 'whistleblower' who was cited as a source in the false story about the alleged FBI wiretap of Donald Trump\n\nFor instance, the story about the Ukrainian information operation allegedly targeting the Trump campaign cited a YouTube video which purported to include shots from an office in Kyiv, where fake campaign posters were visible on the walls. Links to the stories are then posted on Telegram channels and other social media accounts. Eventually, the sensational \u201cscoops\u201d - which, like the Trump wiretap story and a slew of earlier stories about Ukrainian corruption, often repeat themes already popular among patriotic Russians and some supporters of Donald Trump - can reach both Russian influencers and audiences in the West. Although only a few rise to the highest levels of prominence, some have spread to millions \u2013 and to powerful people. A story which originated on DC Weekly, claiming that Ukrainian officials bought yachts with US military aid, was repeated by several members of Congress, including Senator J D Vance and Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene. Mr Vance is one of a handful of politicians mentioned as a potential vice-presidential running mate for Donald Trump.\n\nThe former US cop\n\nOne of the key people involved in the operation is John Mark Dougan, a former US Marine who worked as a police officer in Florida and Maine in the 2000s. Mr Dougan later set up a website designed to collect leaked information about his former employer, the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office. In a harbinger of his activities in Russia, Mr Dougan\u2019s site published authentic information including the home addresses of police officers, alongside fake stories and rumours. The FBI raided his apartment in 2016, at which point he fled to Moscow. He has since written books, reported from occupied parts of Ukraine and has made appearances on Russian think tank panels, at military events and on a TV station owned by Russia\u2019s ministry of defence. In text message conversations with the BBC, Mr Dougan has flatly denied being involved with the websites. On Tuesday, he denied any knowledge of the story about the Bugatti sports car. But at other times he has bragged about his prowess in spreading fake news. At one point he also implied that his activities are a form of revenge against American authorities. \u201cFor me it\u2019s a game,\" he said. \u201cAnd a little payback.\u201d At another point he said: \u201cMy YouTube channel received many strikes for misinformation\u201d for his reporting from Ukraine, raising the prospect of his channel being taken offline. \u201cSo if they want to say misinformation, well, let\u2019s do it right,\u201d he texted.\n\nX (Twitter) Mr Dougan has chronicled his trips to Ukraine on his social media feeds and on appearances on Russian state TV\n\nA large body of digital evidence also shows connections between the former police officer and the Russia-based websites. The BBC and experts we consulted traced IP addresses and other digital information back to websites run by Dougan. At one point a story on the DC Weekly site, written in response to a New York Times piece which mentioned Dougan, was attributed to \u201cAn American Citizen, the owner of these sites,\u201d and stated: \u201cI am the owner, an American citizen, a US military veteran, born and raised in the United States.\u201d The article signed off with Dougan\u2019s email address. Shortly after we reported on Mr Dougan\u2019s activities in a previous story, a fake version of the BBC website briefly appeared online. It was linked through digital markers to his network.\n\nMr Dougan is most likely not the only person working on the influence operation and who funds it remains unclear. \u201cI think it's important not to overplay his role in this campaign,\" said Darren Linvill, co-director of Clemson University\u2019s Media Forensic Hub, which has been tracking the network. \u201cHe may be just a bit of a bit player and a useful dupe, because he's an American.\u201d Despite his appearances on state-run media and at government-linked think tanks, Mr Dougan denies he is being paid by the Kremlin. \u201cI have never been paid a single dime by the Russian government,\u201d he said via text message.\n\nTargeting the US election\n\nThe operation that Dougan is involved in has increasingly shifted its focus from stories about the war in Ukraine to stories about American and British politics. The false article about the FBI and the alleged wiretap at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort was one of the first stories produced by the network that was entirely about US politics, with no mention of Ukraine or Russia. Clint Watts, who leads Microsoft\u2019s Digital Threat Analysis Center, said that the operation often blends together issues with salience both in Ukraine and the West. Mr Watts said that the volume of content being posted and the increasing sophistication of Russia-based efforts could potentially pose a significant problem in the run-up to November\u2019s election. \u201cThey're not getting mass distribution every single time,\u201d he said, but noted that several attempts made each week could lead to false narratives taking hold in the \u201cinformation ocean\u201d of a major election campaign. \u201cIt can have an outsized impact\", and stories from the network can take off very quickly, he said. \u201cGone are the days of Russia purchasing ads in roubles, or having pretty obvious trolls that are sitting in a factory in St. Petersburg,\u201d said Nina Jankowicz, head of the American Sunlight Project, a non-profit organisation attempting to combat the spread of disinformation. Ms Jankowicz was briefly director of the short-lived US Disinformation Governance Board, a branch of the Department of Homeland Security designed to tackle false information. \u201cNow we're seeing a lot more information laundering,\u201d she said - using a term referring to the recycling of fake or misleading stories into the mainstream in order to obscure their ultimate source.\n\nWhere it goes next\n\nYouTube A YouTube video narrated by an AI-generated voice was planted as the source for the false story that Mr Zelensky bought a \u00a320m mansion from King Charles III\n\nMicrosoft researchers also say the operation is attempting to spread stories about UK politics \u2013 with an eye on Thursday\u2019s general election \u2013 and the Paris Olympics. One fake story \u2013 which appeared on the website called the London Crier \u2013 claimed that Mr Zelensky bought a mansion owned by King Charles III at a bargain price. It was seen by hundreds of thousands of users on X, and shared by an official Russian embassy account. YouTube removed an AI-narrated video posted by an obscure channel that was used as the source of the false story after it was flagged by BBC Verify. And Mr Dougan hinted at even bigger plans when asked whether increased attention on his activities would slow the spread of his false stories. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he said, \u201cthe game is being upped.\u201d",

        "text": "Donald Trump, Joe Biden and dementia: Why not to diagnose from a distance\n4 reasons NOT to diagnose dementia from afar\n\n1. The diagnosis often wrong\n\nThere are lots of reasons why a person may appear momentarily confused or forgetful, show poor judgement, or behave strangely.\n\n\n\nSometimes there may be a medical reason, but often there is a straightforward explanation that doesn\u2019t require them to have a neurological condition. They may be tired or jet-lagged, they may have had a glass of wine, they may have an infection, or they may just not have a very good grasp of the topic being discussed. These are all perfectly possible without the need to raise dementia.\n\nDementia is a very specific form of cognitive impairment \u2013 just one of many possible reasons why someone might not be able to think or remember things clearly.\n\nA diagnosis of dementia can only be made after a thorough assessment by a health professional. This involves taking a detailed medical history, carrying out a range of tests, and most often arranging a brain scan.\n\nIt\u2019s not possible to diagnose a person just by watching them on TV. It\u2019s fine to say that a candidate appears to be struggling, or that they seem forgetful or confused. However, it\u2019s not possible to reliably state the underlying cause of these problems without a proper clinical assessment.\n\n2. It stigmatises people living with dementia\n\nWhen an older politician is accused of having dementia, it\u2019s often done to smear their character, question their policies, or seek to disqualify them from holding office. The tone tends to be negative, demeaning and often hateful \u2013 particularly on social media platforms.\n\n\n\nThis reinforces outdated stereotypes of dementia being a condition that, of itself, disqualifies a person from participating in their community or having a voice that\u2019s worth listening to.\n\nHearing dementia being weaponised in this way is both hurtful and unhelpful to people with dementia and their families, who live with the condition every day and often struggle to have their voices heard.\n\nWe want a society in which people living with dementia feel understood, valued, and able to play an active role in their community. This is not helped when people use unsubstantiated allegations of dementia or mental health conditions to belittle or humiliate politicians they don\u2019t like or agree with.\n\n3. It normalises unhelpful language\n\nAs with any sensitive medical condition, the language we use around dementia is important. Language affects the way that people living with dementia are treated by others.\n\nAllegations of dementia in the media often contain lazy or outdated medical terms like \u2018demented\u2019, \u2018senile\u2019, or \u2018addled\u2019. These terms are no longer used by dementia professionals because our understanding of the condition has now advanced well beyond these crude terms.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, they continue to be used in the media, which makes it harder for people to have a proper understanding of what dementia is. This can have a real impact when it comes to getting a diagnosis and then discussing it with family and friends.\n\n\n\nPeople don\u2019t want to be thought of as \u2018senile\u2019 or \u2018losing their marbles\u2019. They want to be supported to live well with a devastating brain disease.\n\n\n\nIf someone does have a diagnosis of dementia, we need to still see them as a person worthy of inclusion, dignity and respect. We should never use their dementia as a label to define or devalue who they are.\n\n4. Diagnosing without a proper medical assessment is unethical\n\nThe current likely presidential candidates, Joe Biden and Donald Trump, are by no means the first politicians to be challenged about dementia or their mental health.\n\n\n\nIn 1964, a magazine article was written about presidential candidate Barry Goldwater that carried the headline \u201c1,189 Psychiatrists say Goldwater is Psychologically Unfit to be President!\u201d The article quoted an informal poll of US psychiatrists, none of whom had actually met the candidate.\n\n\n\nGoldwater lost the election and successfully sued the magazine for making untrue allegations. Out of this case came the \u2018Goldwater Rule\u2019, which to this day strongly discourages psychiatrists from trying to diagnose a person without ever meeting them or doing a proper assessment.\n\n\n\nThe rule states: \u201c...it is unethical for a psychiatrist to offer a professional opinion unless he or she has conducted an examination and has been granted proper authorization for such a statement.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlthough the Goldwater Rule is often broken, it remains an essential piece of ethical guidance for any health professional or expert who might be tempted to diagnose a person without ever meeting them.",

        "text": "Center Prepares for 2024 U.S. Election\nIn November 2022, Carter Center observer Connie Moon Sehat (in purple) monitors a polling station in Fulton County, Georgia. The Center will again bring its expertise to the November 2024 U.S. election.\n\nThe Center\u2019s work emphasizes strengthening trust in the U.S. election system and encouraging citizens to address disagreements in a civil manner.\n\n\u201cThe environment in the United States has changed in ways that have prompted us to expand our programming,\u201d said Barbara Smith, the Carter Center\u2019s vice president of peace programs. \u201cWe believe we can help forge a better path for American democracy than what we\u2019ve seen in recent years.\u201d\n\nThe Carter Center has a hard-earned reputation as a fair, impartial observer of elections overseas. It brought its electoral expertise to a U.S. election for the first time by observing Georgia\u2019s post-election risk-limiting audit in 2020, and its domestic focus has grown ever since.\n\nA Georgia voter marks her ballot in November 2022. The Carter Center is working to give U.S. voters confidence in the electoral system for this November.\n\nWhile not taking political positions itself, the Center for the past three years has been recruiting right-leaning and left-leaning leaders in six swing states \u2014 Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, and Wisconsin \u2014 to bring all kinds of Americans together for civil, fact-based discussions about issues.\n\n\u201cFor too many Americans, the hallmarks of U.S. politics today are polarization, misinformation, disinformation, and distrust of election systems,\u201d said David Carroll, director of the Center\u2019s Democracy Program . \u201cOne way we hope to help is by demystifying the electoral process and highlighting its safeguards.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy did people riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021? Because they thought they were being disenfranchised,\u201d said Nathan Stock, Conflict Resolution Program associate director. \u201cSo what do you do about that? One step is to get trusted messengers to pass on better information about the nature of American elections.\u201d\n\nThe goal is to correct misinformation, search for common ground, and reduce fear of our fellow Americans.\n\n\u201cWe want people on opposite sides to acknowledge one another as human beings,\u201d Stock said. \u201cThey probably won\u2019t ever agree on the Second Amendment or abortion rights, but they can agree that protecting the functioning of our democratic republic is important.\u201d\n\nThe Carter Center recognizes the role that faith communities can play in the effort. It is building a network of religious leaders to work with their congregations to promote healthy conversations and tamp down dehumanizing language.\n\nThe Center\u2019s work has a legal angle as well, partnering with law schools and legal associations to provide lawyers in Georgia, Arizona, and Wisconsin with election-specific knowledge and skills. The effort aims to create a cadre of \u201ccitizen lawyers\u201d who can speak knowledgeably and persuasively about election processes in a way that helps restore public confidence in our elections\u2019 integrity and results, said Randolph Kent, associate director of the Center\u2019s Rule of Law Program.\n\nOn the front lines of that system are election workers, who have been subjected to threats and harassment in recent years. Recognizing the stress of the role, the Center has published a mental health wellness guide just for them.\n\nAs it always has, The Carter Center supports a set of widely accepted international election standards. These include ensuring that all citizens have an equal opportunity to exercise their voting rights. To that end, the Center backs efforts to ensure that voters with disabilities can access polling places, and to secure voting rights for Native Americans and people returning from incarceration.\n\nThe Carter Center also is working to demonstrate the important role that nonpartisan election observers can play in several U.S. states, with plans to support state-based actors in Montana, New Mexico, and California. The Center will provide guidelines and instruction to local organizations working to observe elections in these states.\n\n\u201cWe hope that these nonpartisan groups will provide well-documented public reports and actionable feedback and recommendations on how to improve electoral processes,\u201d Carroll said.\n\nRelated Resources\n\nCarter Center Democracy Program\n\nUnited States Elections",

        "text": "US election: Joe Biden's family urge president to stay in White House race as donors discuss alternative scenarios in Trump battle\nJoe Biden's family has urged the US president not to quit the election campaign, even as donors discussed the alternatives if he pulled out following his disastrous performance in last week's first presidential debate with Donald Trump.\n\nMr Biden's family discussed the future of his campaign when they met for a long-planned photo shoot at Camp David in Maryland on Sunday, and told him he should \"keep fighting\", NBC, Sky News' US partner said, quoting two sources familiar with the discussions.\n\nHis wife Jill Biden and Mr Biden's son, Hunter, the people whose opinions he values most, both insisted he should stay in the race as he's the best-placed candidate to defeat Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 0:44 'Biden, you are fired'\n\nIt was a view echoed by the rest of the family, who instead blamed the president's advisers for failing to prepare him properly.\n\nAround 40 of Biden's top financial backers were briefed by campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez, who told them most of the campaign's significant war chest would fall to Vice President Kamala Harris, with a smaller pool of money kept by the Democratic National Committee (DNC).\n\nIt was one of several meetings in recent days in which campaign managers have tried to shore up support for Mr Biden, whom, they insist, can still win November's election.\n\nBut a Biden victory appeared a long way away as the 81-year-old Democrat candidate paused and stumbled his way through a gruelling TV debate on Thursday in Atlanta, his performance dismissed as an \"unmitigated disaster\" by some in his own party.\n\nA poll of polls maintained by analysts FiveThirtyEight had the pair roughly neck and neck until the debate, but Donald Trump has since pulled ahead, if only by one percentage point. RealClearPolitics put Trump 1.9 percentage points in front.\n\nWatched by an estimated 51 million people, Mr Biden, whose age was already seen as a liability by voters, sounded raspy, trailed off, and at times gave convoluted answers during the debate.\n\nThe president's showing sparked alarm among supporters, donors and campaign surrogates, worried that Mr Biden's age, already targeted by Trump, 78, had caught up with him, and this was one campaign too far.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:32 Vice President: Biden had 'slow start'\n\nMr Biden's campaign has been working hard to persuade them that is not the case ever since.\n\nProminent Democrats made a public show of support for him on Sunday, among them congressman James Clyburn of South Carolina, who said: \"I do not believe that Joe Biden has a problem leading for the next four years.\"\n\nRead more from Sky News:\n\nNew York Times tells Biden to quit\n\nJoe Biden: Could the Democrats replace him?\n\nWho is Gavin Newsom?

        "text": "Pennsylvania election official on the greatest threat in the 2024 presidential election\nIn 2020, the crucial battleground state of Pennsylvania faced significant turmoil with election protests, court challenges and threats against election officials, including Republican Al Schmidt.\n\nSchmidt, who previously oversaw Philadelphia's elections as a commissioner and supervised the city's election, now holds the position of secretary of the commonwealth, the state's top election official.\n\nHe said the greatest threat to the 2024 presidential election is the high turnover rate among those officials who are responsible for running elections.\n\n\"Some people left because of the ugly environment with threats. Some people left because it was time for them to retire,\" said Schmidt.\n\nMore than 80 senior election officials across two-thirds of Pennsylvania's 67 counties have departed. When long-time election workers are replaced by less experienced individuals, the likelihood of errors in election administration increases, according to Schmidt.\n\nAn analysis of last year's general election in Pennsylvania found that ballot errors doubled in the state's municipal general elections from 2021 to 2023. These errors included incorrect instructions to voters on the number of candidates to vote for; duplicate ballots being sent to the same voter; races or candidates being left off the ballot; improper ballot instructions; and spelling mistakes.\n\n\"When you are running elections, there is no room for error, right? There's no redos or do-overs,\" said Schmidt, adding that remedial actions were put in place to ensure the accuracy of the results despite the mistakes.\n\nChris Spackman, the new director of elections for Dauphin County, will oversee his first presidential election this year. Spackman, who previously served as deputy director, feels well-supported in his new role, receiving guidance from fellow election directors and his predecessor.\n\nBut not all counties have the same level of support. In some counties in Pennsylvania and across the country, a single person is responsible for managing the entire election process. Ensuring the integrity of the vote in these cases often requires reliance on other departments or offices within the county.\n\n\"But in our experience, you have checks and balances built into this system to make sure election results are accurate and people can have confidence in those results,\" said Schmidt.\n\nA CBS News poll revealed that 72% of Pennsylvania Republicans do not consider President Biden the legitimate winner of the 2020 presidential election. Schmidt encouraged those with doubts to get more involved in the election process.\n\n\"When I meet people who are responsible for running elections, I don't know if they're Democrats, I don't know if they're Republicans, and I don't really care if they are or not. I care that they're running elections in a way that's free and fair and safe and secure,\" said Schmidt.\n\nLooking ahead to Nov. 6, the day after Election Day, Schmidt said he has one clear hope: that news agencies report, \"Election Day went smoothly in Pennsylvania.\"",

        "text": "'Something needs to happen': Democratic voters on replacing Biden\n'Something needs to happen' - Democratic voters on replacing Biden\n\nBBC\n\nIn the days since President Joe Biden's widely-criticised debate performance against former president Donald Trump, Democrats across the country have begun questioning whether Mr Biden is the best candidate for the party. Most voters think Democrats have a better chance of keeping the White House if Biden isn\u2019t the nominee, a CNN poll found this week. The BBC spoke to Democratic voters who reflected that concern but who also worried about the logistics of switching candidates this far into the campaign. As the party confronts this thorny question, we asked voters what they want to see Democrats do next and who they think could replace Mr Biden. Familiar names include Vice-President Kamala Harris, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, California Governor Gavin Newsom and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro. We start with a voter who feels the Democratic party is not listening to its constituents and wants a fresh face atop the ticket in place of Mr Biden.\n\nThey give us these text messages \"Are you going to support President Biden for re-election?\" and I said \"no\". I don't want someone who doesn't have the ability to continue in office for a very long time. I'm just tired. They push who they think is going to get elected without listening to our voices. We want someone younger, we want someone who has new ideas, has new ways to engage the whole country. But at the same time, what do I do now? He should step aside. I'm hoping we get someone fresh, but I don't know who. Other candidates don't get the air time, so I have to do my own research. I want someone new. I wish he would step down. I wish he would recognize as president, you're the president of the people. Listen to the people, listen to us. I definitely have been watching the governor of Michigan [Whitmer]. I think we need a woman as president and that's who I would like on a ticket.\n\nKyle worries the Democratic party has no game plan and is dismissing voters' concerns about Biden's abilities. I think there has to be a serious discussion about Biden stepping down... In the end, it's up to Joe Biden, but I think at very least, there should be some other candidates floated to be able to to articulate what our our game plan is going forward... I think the more the party tries to tell the public to not believe what we saw during that debate, it's going to take me from believing we should maybe just deal with Biden to we need a change. A lot of Democratic voters feel gas lit. We're being asked to not believe what we saw, and being told that this is a one off, and we know that this is not a one-off. There's been a lot that's been accomplished, but if we can't articulate those messages, we can't win, which means that vision ceases to continue. The president - they affect down ballot races, and those down ballot races could mean catastrophe with what's at stake in this election. Gretchen Whitmer would be an excellent example of someone who could replace Biden, or Pete Buttigieg, but I think at this stage, it's difficult to say. But I think a Whitmer-Buttigieg ticket could win. We need people and Democratic candidates who are from Midwestern states or other states who know how to communicate a little bit better with people in their constituencies.\n\nThis voter thinks Biden never should have run for this second term, but he is concerned that it is too late in the process to replace Biden. On the one hand, I personally wouldn't mind him stepping down, but that does lead me to a lot of scepticism that whoever replaces him as the nominee would have the capabilities and momentum to beat Trump. It is a tough question of who could replace Biden. Realistically, I don't think my policy positions totally align with VP [Kamala] Harris, but I do think that, honestly, she'd probably be the best choice for president in terms of logistics, in terms of name recognition. If he were to step down, she's the clear successor. She's already part of the ticket. That said, I think if we could go back in time and rerun the primary system and actually have a proper voting primary with a field of candidates, I'd probably be more likely to lean towards someone who has a bit more support in the midwest and rust belt states. Someone like Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer or Illinois Governor JB Pritzker.\n\nSomething needs to happen. The Democrats need to have a moment of, \"hey, this is what we did wrong\". Let's have a conversation about if Biden is truly viable or not. Is he the best to beat Trump now? I don't think anyone can confidently say he is. Possibly Gavin Newsom is. He's primed himself as the best alternative, knowing that this opportunity would come up. If he runs, he's just a name that people can get behind. He has a face that people like. He has a great family. I just don't know another name in the Democratic Party who, at this stage of the race, could catch up. Gavin Newsom, who has primed himself to be in that position, or [Pennsylvania Governor] Josh Shapiro, who is an underdog that can really get there.\n\nThis voter, who is a progressive Democrat, would love to see Biden replaced on the Democratic ticket but worries that it's too late. I'm conflicted. Personally, yes, I think Biden should step down, but realistically and logistically, no - the primary is done. He has won the Democratic nomination, even though participation in the primaries for an incumbent president is more of a formality. You have other candidates, like Newsom, Whitmer, Pritzker, Harris, who could technically be good candidates to replace him, but the plan should have been put in place years ago, if not a year ago, in my opinion. Yeah, I would personally like to see Biden replaced, but I don't see how that would logistically happen. I would like to see Pritzker on the ticket. It seems to me that Newsom is the heir apparent, but I would say Pritzker and maybe Harris, or Harris-Pritzker. Pritzker has a more progressive policy that he's enacted in Illinois that could expand as a vision for the rest of the country. Biden's done a good job as president, and I think his legacy as a decent one-term caretaker president is at risk by trying to hold on to power. His legacy is absolutely in the gutter if he loses to Trump, in a landslide, which seems to be a possibility.\n\nIt's too late. We're too close to the election to have a switch. If there was a single person that everyone could immediately get behind, maybe. But I don't think that person exists right now. I think if Kamala Harris came in, there'd be all these people complaining about her. Or if Pete Buttigieg came in, people complaining about him. So I think right now, where we are right now, I think it's too late to switch. If Biden were to drop out, I like Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg. Kamala Harris has the most name recognition, so I like her quite a lot, but I know that she also turns a lot of people off. I would worry that she would cause people not to show up to vote, but I guess I would support her.\n\nJessica doesn't know how the Democrats can come back from Joe Biden's debate performance without replacing him. I want to see him replaced. I feel guilty or bad saying that or thinking that. If Joe Biden stays in the race, I'll be voting for Joe Biden. But I don't see how he can come back from that debate performance. There are a lot of people who folks would be genuinely excited to vote for and I think now it's really a feeling of dread. Gretchen Whitmer is a name that has been thrown around who I think would be great. Josh Shapiro is wonderful. Those are two that come to mind who I think people would be excited about. I'd be excited to vote for Josh Shapiro, I'd be excited to vote for Gretchen Whitmer, I'd be excited to vote for Gavin Newsom. I don't even know a ton about Gavin Newsom, but from what I do know, I think there would be a level of excitement just knowing we have somebody other than Joe Biden who is qualified and capable and dynamic and decades younger.",

        "text": "US election: Can the Democrats replace Joe Biden? \u2013 DW \u2013 07\nIn the wake of the Biden-Trump debate, there's been some discussion among Democrats about whether it would be better for the party if Joe Biden stepped down. How likely is that? And what would happen if he did?\n\nAfter the first debate between US President Joe Biden and his presumptive challenger Donald Trump last Thursday night, it's no exaggeration to say that the liberal-leaning part of the country was in despair.\n\nAgain and again throughout the night, Biden sounded frail and delivered sentences that made no sense. Social media users joked that Vice President Kamala Harris should be \"subbed in\" during commercial breaks, and that the debate resembled a humiliating family fight.\n\nBiden was not able to dispel voters' concerns about his age during the first presidential debate on June 27 Image: Mike Blake/REUTERS\n\nSince then, Biden has blamed his performance on exhaustion from extensive international travel before the debate, and a little bit of calm has settled in.\n\n\"Where the time right after the debate saw a lot of nervous energy run through the party, the last couple of days have been a shoring up of the Democratic basis,\" Cathryn Cl\u00fcver Ashbrook, a German-American trans-Atlantic politics expert with the German Bertelsmann Foundation, told DW.\n\n\"And would-be candidates that were floated to replace Joe Biden immediately after the debate have come out very strongly in support of the president.\"\n\nCalifornia's Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, who was among those being suggested as a replacement, said on US broadcaster MSNBC, \"You don\u2019t turn your back [on your candidate] because of one performance. What kind of party does that?\"\n\nNot everyone in the Democratic Party sees it the same way. Lloyd Doggett, a member of the US House of Representatives from Texas, became the first sitting Democrat in Congress to call for Biden to step back on Tuesday.\n\n\"Recognizing that, unlike Trump, President Biden's first commitment has always been to our country, not himself, I am hopeful that he will make the painful and difficult decision to withdraw,\" Doggett was quoted by The Associated Press news agency. \"I respectfully call on him to do so.\"\n\nHow likely is Biden to step down?\n\nDoggett is not a major player, but concerns about Biden's age have only gotten stronger since the debate last Thursday.\n\nSwitching out a candidate, especially a sitting president, this late in the race would be highly unusual. But it's not impossible.\n\n\"To replace a candidate at this point, ideally, he would step back himself,\" said Filippo Trevisan, an associate professor at American University's School of Communication in Washington. \"That would be simplest.\"\n\nTrevisan also said, though, that he does not see Biden, who has been in national politics all of his adult life, giving up on the chance to win a second term in the White House.\n\n\"Things could change over the next week when they look at poll numbers,\" said Trevisan, a US politics and campaign expert. \"But right now, based on what we've heard from [Biden] and his campaign team, I think it's highly unlikely he'd step down.\"\n\nOn Monday, the Biden campaign released an ad showing a forceful Biden talking to a crowd, saying, \"I know I'm not a young man, but I know how to do this job\u2026 and I know like millions of Americans know, when you get knocked down, you get back up.\"\n\nWhat would happen if Biden did step down?\n\nIn the primaries, supporters of the Democrats and Republicans cast ballots for who they want to be their candidate. Whoever wins in each of the 50 states receives the support of that state's delegates. At the Democratic National Convention in August, these delegates will vote on who will be the Democrat's presidential candidate. The vast majority of them are pledged to Biden. They are not legally required to vote for him, but by virtue of how the US primary process works, it's what is expected of them.\n\nIf Biden steps down, \"it's a free-for-all,\" said Trevisan. \"They could vote for whomever they want.\"\n\nThat's what is called an open convention, and delegates would vote according to their conscience. Democratic Party leadership would pick a candidate that they think has the best chance of winning the presidential election, and then try to get delegates to back him or her.\n\n\"I would say Harris really has the right of first refusal.,\" J. Miles Coleman, an election analyst with the University of Virginia Center for Politics, told DW right after the debate.\n\nBiden-Trump debate: Voters underwhelmed by TV clash To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nBut Trevisan said picking Harris in such a case might not actually be the best move.\n\n\"Her association with the Biden presidency could be a negative,\" he said. \"Her approval numbers are similar to Biden's.\"\n\nWhen a president becomes incapacitated while in office, for example, through a medical emergency, the vice president takes on the job. But Harris would not automatically become the candidate if the president were to step down ahead of the convention.\n\nPossible Biden replacements: Harris, Newsom, Whitmer\n\nA number of names have been floated, particularly in the days after the debate, for who could become the presidential candidate if Biden was out of the picture. In addition to Vice President Harris and California's Governor Newsom, there is also Governor Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan.\n\nWhitmer was first elected governor in 2018 and reelected in 2022. Her reelection was considered a big success \u2015 2022 was a midterm election under a Democratic president (Biden), and it's usually harder for candidates from the incumbent's party to win over voters. But Whitmer managed to win another term with a larger-than-expected margin and in the important battleground state of Michigan, which is not considered a sure-fire win state for Democrats like California or New York.\n\nBut just like other powerful Democrats, Whitmer has publicly supported Biden after the debate, writing on social media platform X that \"we need to reelect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.\"\n\nNancy Pelosi of California, who was speaker of the House for two terms and is somewhat of a grande dame in the Democratic Party, has called on both Biden and Trump to undergo tests for their health and mental acuity. But according to AP, she also emphasized that Biden is on \"top of his game, in terms of knowing the issues and what is at stake.\"\n\nCould another candidate be elected against Biden's will?\n\nWhat if Biden doesn't step down, but Democrats still want to install another candidate at the convention in August?\n\n\"That's not going to work unless the Democratic Party statutes are overruled or changed,\" said Cl\u00fcver Ashbrook of the Bertelsmann Foundation. The US, after all, \"have had primaries where Joe Biden has claimed 99% of the delegates. To willingly go against a delegate vote, that circumvents a democratic process. When the country is in a perilous moment in its own democracy, nobody is going to attempt that in the Democratic Party.\"\n\nIf Biden were to drop out even later \u2014 after the convention, for instance, over health reasons \u2014 not even the delegates could vote on a candidate. Instead, the Democratic National Committee would convene and decide on a candidate \u2015 something that would certainly fuel discussions on the state of US democracy.\n\nEdited by: Andreas Illmer",

He told a Wisconsin radio station he made a \"mistake\" with his stumbling performance, but urged voters to instead judge him on his time in the White House. On Wednesday, as reports suggested he was weighing his future, he worked to calm senior Democrats including state governors and campaign staff. \u201cI'm the nominee of the Democratic Party. No one's pushing me out. I'm not leaving,\" he said in a call to the broader campaign, a source told BBC News. Mr Biden was joined on the call by Vice-President Kamala Harris, who reiterated her support. Speculation has mounted over whether she could replace the president as the party\u2019s candidate ahead of the November election. A fundraising email sent after the call by the Biden-Harris campaign was also bullish. \u201cLet me say this as clearly and simply as I can: I'm running,\u201d Mr Biden said. Can Biden be replaced as nominee? It's not easy\n\nThe names in the frame if Biden quits Questions have been swirling around whether the 81-year-old will continue with his campaign following a debate marked by verbal blanks and a weak voice. It sparked concern in Democratic circles around his fitness for office and his ability to win the election. Pressure on Mr Biden to drop out has only grown as more polls suggest his Republican rival\u2019s lead has widened. A New York Times poll conducted after the debate, which was published on Wednesday, suggested Trump was now holding his biggest lead yet at six points. And a separate poll published by the BBC\u2019s US partner CBS News suggested Trump has a three-point lead over Mr Biden in the crucial battleground states.\n\nName-calling and insults - key moments from Biden and Trump\u2019s debate\n\nThe damaging polling for Mr Biden has been compounded by some Democratic donors and lawmakers publicly calling on the president to stand aside. Among them are Ramesh Kapur, an Indian-American industrialist based in Massachusetts, who has organised fundraisers for Democrats since 1988. \u201cI think it\u2019s time for him to pass the torch,\u201d Mr Kapur told the BBC. \u201cI know he has the drive, but you can\u2019t fight Mother Nature.\u201d And two Democrats in Congress also called for a change at the top of the party\u2019s ticket. The second, Representative Raul Grijalva of Arizona, told the New York Times it was time for Democrats to \u201clook elsewhere\u201d. Despite this, the White House and the Biden campaign have vehemently denied reports he is actively weighing his future and say he is committed to defeating Trump for a second time on 5 November. The New York Times and CNN reported on Wednesday that Mr Biden had told an unnamed ally he was aware his re-election bid was in danger. His forthcoming appearances - including an ABC News interview and a Friday rally in Wisconsin - were hugely important to his campaign, he reportedly said.\n\nMore on the election\n\nA spokesperson rejected the reports as \u201cabsolutely false\u201d, shortly before White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said reports that he may drop out were untrue. Among the senior Democrats Mr Biden met on Wednesday was a group of 20 state governors from around the country, including California\u2019s Gavin Newsom and Michigan\u2019s Gretchen Whitmer. Both have been tipped as potential replacements if Mr Biden were to stand aside. \"The president has always had our backs, we\u2019re going to have his back as well,\" Maryland Governor Wes Moore told reporters after the meeting. CBS confirmed reports that Mr Biden told governors that he needs to get more sleep and curtail public events and meetings that stretch after 20:00, according to a participant in the meeting. Should Mr Biden step down, Ms Harris is still considered the most likely replacement. The 59-year-old has been hampered by poor approval ratings, but her support has increased among Democrats since the Biden-Trump debate. Amid the speculation, comments made by Trump indicated he could be switching his attention to attacking Ms Harris. In footage obtained by the Daily Beast - and shared online by Trump himself - he can be seen in a golf cart pouring scorn on Mr Biden, whom he describes as \"broken down\". He suggests that Ms Harris would be \"better\", though still \"pathetic\".\n\nEPA President Biden and Vice-President Harris presented a united front to Democrats on Wednesday (file image)",

        "text": "Joe Biden defiantly vows to stay in US presidential race\nJoe Biden has defiantly vowed to keep running for re-election after rejecting pressure from within the Democratic Party to withdraw after a disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump.\n\n\"Let me say this as clearly as I possibly can, as simply and straightforward as I can: I am running,\" the president said, according to a top aide who posted his comment on X.\n\n\"I'm not leaving. I'm in this race to the end, and we're going to win,\" he added, NBC News reported, citing a campaign official on the call.\n\nRead more: The key moments in the first US presidential election debate\n\nOn the call, Mr Biden also called for his party to unify, telling them \"when Democrats unite, we will always win, just as we beat Donald Trump in 2020, we're going to beat him again in 2024\".\n\nIt comes after The New York Times reported the 81-year-old US president had told an ally he was weighing up whether to run against Mr Trump in November's US election.\n\nOn Tuesday Mr Biden said he \"nearly fell asleep\" during last week's first presidential debate, during which commentators widely said he performed poorly.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, which called for President Biden to step aside after the debate, an anonymous \"key ally\" of the president said: \"He knows if he has two more events like that, we're in a different place\" by the weekend.\n\nThey emphasised the president is still fighting for re-election but he understands his next few appearances are pivotal.\n\nAnother anonymous adviser told the New York Times the president was \"well aware of the political challenge he faces\".\n\nAfter the report was published, White House spokesperson Andrew Bates wrote on social media: \"This claim is absolutely false.\"\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 2:49 US voters react to Biden debate\n\nMr Biden put his performance down to travel exhaustion after going \"around the world a couple of times\" shortly before the debate.\n\nThe US president admitted he \"wasn't very smart\" for having travelled extensively in the weeks leading up to the first TV debate of the election campaign in Atlanta.\n\nHis performance was such that friends and foes alike have told him to quit the race for the White House.\n\nBiden's response so far looks 'more like frailty than fighter' James Matthews US correspondent @jamesmatthewsky Among the screaming headlines is the line that will scream loudest to Joe Biden, Democrats and those deciding his future. The media company \u201cPuck\u201d reports that Democratic polling shows he\u2019s losing support in key battleground states in the wake of the TV debate. Places that were in his pocket, like New Hampshire, Virginia and New Mexico are now in play. Also, Biden is shown as trailing behind other alternative party candidates, including vice-president Kamala Harris, in hypothetical races against Donald Trump. More than anything, it is the voter\u2019s voice that will dictate Democratic choices about their leader. These early rumblings won\u2019t go unheard and, if amplified in the coming days, they will shift the gears in the drive for change. The race against Donald Trump has always been close but Democrats have taken heart from a Biden trajectory that showed signs of arcing upwards. Now the signs say something else. A sense of crisis around the president has become increasingly embedded in the Democratic party in the days since the stage showdown with Donald Trump. Many are as angry about the response to the debate as the debate itself and the sentiment is shared among party members, elected officials and some donors. Their concern is that their man has had nearly a week to confound concerns around his well-being and has, seemingly, ignored the political necessity to do so. There have been public appearances but the president has been stage-managed to within an inch of his life. He hasn\u2019t answered a single question from a journalist and has delivered only pre-prepared statements, read from autocue. It\u2019s the look of an insulated, tele-prompted president and it looks more like frailty than fighter. It\u2019s infuriating a party looking for reassurance about their president\u2019s health and for his recognition that it needs delivered, urgently.\n\nMr Biden told supporters at a campaign event in Virginia on Tuesday: \"I decided to travel around the world a couple times, going through around 100 time zones.\"\n\nFollow Sky News on WhatsApp Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky News Tap here\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free\n\nHe added he \"didn't listen\" to his staff, \"came back and nearly fell asleep on stage\".\n\n\"That's no excuse but it is an explanation,\" he added while admitting: \"I didn't have my best night.\"",

The source of the funds was supposedly American military aid money.\n\nThe story appeared on an obscure French website just days ago - and was swiftly debunked.\n\nExperts pointed out strange anomalies on the invoice posted online. A whistleblower cited in the story appeared only in an oddly edited video that may have been artificially created. Bugatti issued a sharp denial, calling it \"fake news\", external, and its Paris dealership threatened legal action against the people behind the false story.\n\nBut before the truth could even get its shoes on, the lie had gone viral. Influencers had already picked up the false story and spread it widely.\n\nOne X user, the pro-Russia, pro-Donald Trump activist Jackson Hinkle, posted a link seen by more than 6.5m people. Several other accounts spread the story to millions more X users \u2013 at least 12m in total, according to the site\u2019s metrics.\n\nIt was a fake story, on a fake news website, designed to spread widely online, with its origins in a Russia-based disinformation operation BBC Verify first revealed last year - at which point the operation appeared to be trying to undermine Ukraine\u2019s government.",

        "text": "Why Joe Biden Should Stay in the Race\nPresident Joe Biden\u2019s performance during the June 27 debate with former President Donald Trump inspired panic among some supporters. In its wake, some have called for Biden to bow out of the 2024 election in favor either of Vice President Kamala Harris or a range of the party\u2019s rising stars including swing-state governors Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, J.B. Pritzker of Illinois, and Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania.\n\nImage American University Professor Allan Lichtman, PhD \u201973 / Wiki Commons\n\nNot so fast says American University Professor Allan Lichtman , PhD \u201973. Lichtman, who has correctly predicted the results of 9 of the last 10 presidential elections using a system he developed in 1981 with mathematician Vladimir Keilis-Borok, says that Democrats\u2019 prospects for victory in November would be far worse if Biden stepped aside. In this conversation with Havard Griffin GSAS Communications, he asserts that it would be a \u201chuge mistake\u201d to forfeit the electoral advantages of incumbency and of having a candidate who has had no serious challenges from within his own party.\n\nThis interview has been edited for clarity, correctness, and length.\n\nBefore we get to your model, do you have concerns about Biden\u2019s ability to campaign effectively and to handle the presidency at his age?\n\nSure I have some concerns, but not about his ability to campaign effectively. He had some excellent, energetic events after the debate. He delivered one of the great State of the Union addresses just a few months ago when he was able to ad-lib and respond to the audience. It was a bravura performance.\n\nEven so . . .\n\nLook, I'm not a neurologist\u2014and neither are the critics going after Joe Biden. They have no basis to offer an opinion on Biden\u2019s cognitive capacities. Beyond that, what all these folks share in common is that none of them have a track record in predicting elections, and yet they claim to know what the Democrats must do to win.\n\nLet me read you a couple of headlines: \u201cDebate Debacle,\u201d \u201cGreat Concern at Democratic Headquarters.\u201d Those aren\u2019t headlines from after last Thursday\u2019s debate; those are from after Barack Obama\u2019s performance in the first presidential debate of 2012. Afterward, a CNN poll showed that 72 percent of viewers thought Obama lost, which was worse than the 67 percent who thought Biden lost last Thursday. And, of course, Obama went on to win an electoral college landslide, 332 to 206. On the other hand, when Hillary Clinton won all three debates in 2016\u2014and then again after the Access Hollywood tape\u2014the pundits said Trump was finished. Now they\u2019re telling us Biden\u2019s finished after one debate. It's nonsense.\n\nHow many times in the last 120 years has the party holding the White House prevailed in the elections where the incumbent didn\u2019t run? Never.\n\n\u2014Allan Lichtman\n\nYou mentioned having a track record in predicting presidential elections. You\u2019ve correctly predicted nine of the last ten using a system of 13 key factors : party mandate, contest, incumbency, serious third-party campaign, short-term economy, long-term economy, policy change, social unrest, scandal, foreign/military failure, foreign/military success, incumbent charisma, and challenger charisma. If 8 of the 13 are favorable to the incumbent, they win. If less than eight are favorable, they lose. So why does the model lead you to argue that Biden should stay in the race?\n\nThe keys gauge the strength and performance of the White House party. That is, they're premised on the finding that American presidential elections are votes up or down on the strength and performance of the party in power.\n\nBiden checks off two keys; obviously, he\u2019s an incumbent and his path to the nomination was uncontested. That means that 6 of the remaining 11 keys would have to be negative in order to predict the Democrats\u2019 defeat. If Biden gets bumped, the Democrats lose the incumbency key and the party contest key because there's no heir apparent. That means only four more keys would have to be unfavorable.\n\nBut let's leave aside the keys and look at history. How many times in the last 120 years has the party holding the White House prevailed in the elections where the incumbent didn\u2019t run as in 1920, 1952, 1968, 2008, or 2016? Never. It\u2019s a sure prescription for defeat. In effect, those calling for Biden to step aside want to recreate the same set of circumstances that led to defeat in 2016.\n\nIf the odds are still in favor of the incumbent, why hasn't it shown up in the polls?\n\nPolls are snapshots, not predictors. Remember, the pollsters assured us Hillary Clinton was bound to win in 2016. In fact, the Princeton Election Consortium said there was a 99 percent chance that Clinton would win. The eminent professor, Sam Wang, said, \u201cIf I'm wrong I'll eat a bug on national TV.\u201d And he did. The last Gallup poll showed Romney beating Obama in 2012. So, I don't use the polls for prediction.\n\nThis is a particularly fluid election. We have the debate. We're going to have the sentencing of Donald Trump on July 11. We may have a mini-trial on his immunity claim in New York. We have two conventions coming up. So, even if you believe the polls, it's way too early.\n\nFinally, could things be different this time? Take a look at the economy, for instance. Unemployment is at or near a 50-year low, GDP is strong, the stock market is at or near an all-time high, inflation has cooled, and real wages have risen for those who need it most. And yet many Americans believe the economy is in recession . Is it possible that traditional criteria won\u2019t be as predictive at a time when perceptions and data are diverging?\n\nI\u2019m a historian not a psychic. It's always possible, in any given year, that events could be so different that they break the pattern of history. But the keys are very robust. Developmentally they go back to 1860\u2014the horse and buggy days when Abe Lincoln was elected. Predictively, they go back to 1984 when Ronald Reagan was elected to a second term.\n\nWhat I think you're putting your finger on outside the context of the keys is a horrendous message deficit on the part of the Democrats. That was partly what we saw in the debate. It wasn't just Biden not being a great debater. It was that whoever prepared him didn't create a good message. And that's why there's this disconnect between the reality of the economy and a lot of perceptions. I've been screaming about the Democratic deficit in messaging for years. They don't seem to hear it.",

Abigail Disney, an heiress to the Disney family fortune, told business news channel CNBC that she did not believe Mr Biden could win against Trump.\n\nShe said her intent to pull support was rooted in \u201crealism, not disrespect\u201d.\n\n\u201cBiden is a good man and has served his country admirably, but the stakes are far too high.\"\n\nThe consequences of defeat in November \"will be genuinely dire\u201d, she added.\n\nMs Disney has given thousands of dollars to left-leaning political groups this year, according to Federal Election Commission records. But a spokesperson for the Biden campaign told BBC News she has not donated to the campaign directly this cycle.\n\nA handful of other wealthy donors have conveyed similar intent.\n\nPhilanthropist Gideon Stein told the New York Times that his family was withholding $3.5m (\u00a32.8m) to non-profit and political organisations active in the presidential race unless Mr Biden steps aside.\n\nHollywood producer Damon Lindelof, who has donated more than $100,000 to Democrats this election cycle, wrote a public essay in Deadline urging other donors to withhold their funds until there is a change.\n\nThe brother of Barack Obama's former chief of staff, Hollywood agent Ari Emanuel, told a conference in Colorado that withholding funding was the key to ensuring Mr Biden's exit from the race, the Financial Times reported on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThe lifeblood to a campaign is money, and maybe the only way . . . is if the money starts drying up,\u201d he said, according to the newspaper.",

        "text": "Interview | Shanto Iyengar on affective polarisation in US and European politics\nOn 27-28 June, the European Governance and Politics Programme hosted Professor Shanto Iyengar, who delivered the keynote speech at the workshop titled 'Towards affective depolarisation? Finding remedies to affective polarisation in democracies.'\n\nShanto Iyengar is William Robertson Coe Professor and Professor of Political Science and of Communication, Director of the Communication at Stanford University. He is also currently the co-principal investigator of the American National Elections Studies.\n\nIn the interview with Dietlind Stolle, James McGill Professor in Political Science at McGill University, Iyengar shared insights on affective polarisation in US and European politics, the media's role, and the spillover of polarisation into daily life, including education, public health, and misinformation.\n\nRegarding whether the presidential debate could influence voter opinions, Iyengar stated, \u201cThe country [US] is highly polarised. This has happened over the last 50 or 60 years and it has reached the point where two political parties see each other as existential threats... So my sense is that the debate, given the polarised state of American politics, it\u2019s not going to change anyone\u2019s opinion.\u201d He noted that the only voters potentially swayed by the debate are the independent ones, who make up only about 15-17% of the electorate.\n\nIyengar also examined the European political landscape, highlighting immigration as a common divisive issue on both continents. \u201cIt is that which has led to the rise of populist movements and populist parties, and therefore you [Europe] have now a very similar intense argumentation over this issue which increases people\u2019s emotional stake that they have in politics.\u201d He further explained the differences between US and European party systems, signaling that the issue of affective polarisation in Europe is more complicated.\n\nWhen discussing the spillover of affective polarisation, Iyengar remarked, \u201cThe divide has spread into entirely non-political debates. People are now dating co-partisans... About 80% of American households today, if you have two adults living together, they have the same party registration.\u201d\n\nRegarding whether this phenomenon is \u2018treatable\u2019, Iyengar suggested, \u201cI think the next step, logically, is to get a causal dynamics... And my view is that you have to look at the media environment as the fundamental cause.\u201d\n\nA full recording of Professor Shanto Iyengar\u2019s keynote speech, titled 'Affective polarisation: assessing the state of the field' is available on the European Governance Programme\u2019s YouTube channel.",

        "text": "2024 U.K. election is set to overhaul British politics. Here's what to know as Labour projected to win.\nLondon \u2014 British voters voted Thursday in the United Kingdom's first general election since 2019, with an exit poll projecting the Labour Party notching 410 seats for a decisive win over the Conservative Party.\n\nAmong those seen heading to their local polling stations were incumbent Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, whom Conservative Party voters were forecast to boot from power after 14 years running the government, and his chief rival and likely replacement, Labour Party leader Keir Starmer.\n\nHere's what to know about the 2024 British general election.\n\nWho is up for election in the U.K.?\n\nBritish voters were not directly electing a new leader on Thursday. Under the United Kingdom's parliamentary system, voters choose their local representatives for the lower house of Parliament, the House of Commons.\n\nOn Thursday, there are 650 parliamentary seats up for grabs, each of which will be occupied by one Member of Parliament (MP) in the House of Commons. For any single party to win an outright majority in the Commons, it would need to win at least 326 seats \u2014 over half of those available. Any party that does that gets to form the next government, with its leader becoming the prime minister.\n\nAn exit poll projected the Conservative Party garnered just 131 seats, with the Labour Party forecast to win 410 seats.\n\n[Yes, King Charles III is Britain's formal head of state. You can read here about what limited power that actually conveys.]\n\nBritish Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and his wife Akshata Murty walk outside a polling station before casting their votes in the general election, in Northallerton, northeast England, July 4, 2024. Temilade Adelaja/REUTERS\n\nParliament was formally dissolved on May 30 when Sunak called the election, as is procedure, but prior to that, Sunak's long-ruling Conservative Party held an outright majority of 345 seats, giving it significant power to set the policy agenda.\n\nThe U.K. has what is called a first-past-the-post system, which means voters receive a ballot paper with a list of candidates from different parties and select only one of their choice. The candidate from each constituency with the most votes wins the seat \u2014 with no specific threshold required. So if, for instance, there are six candidates in a particular race, they will all be from different parties, and even if the candidate with the most votes only wins 25% of the total, they still win the seat.\n\nIf a voter believes their favorite candidate has a low chance of winning, they can choose to vote tactically and put their X next to another candidate's name \u2014 effectively a second choice \u2014 if they feel that candidate has a better chance of winning. This tactic is generally seen as a way for a voter to help block a candidate deemed highly unfavorable, but who stands a reasonable chance of winning, from gaining the seat in a race.\n\nIn practice, this system means that a political party could win a healthy share of votes on a national level but not win a proportional share of the seats. Smaller political parties in the U.K. have long argued that the first-past-the-post electoral system has thus helped to cement the power of Britain's two biggest parties \u2014 the incumbent, right-leaning Conservative Party, often called the Tories, and their main rivals, the more left-leaning Labour Party.\n\nLabour Party leader Keir Starmer speaks during a live TV debate with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, seen in the background, in Nottingham, England, June 26, 2024, in the build-up to the U.K. general election. PHIL NOBLE/POOL/AFP/Getty\n\nWhat is the U.K. election timeline?\n\nVoting begins in the U.K. general election on Thursday morning, and most constituency results are expected by early Friday morning, although this may take longer in some more rural parts of the country \u2014 particularly if the vote tally is close or subject to a recount.\n\nThere is usually an early indicator of the overall results of a U.K. general election as a joint exit poll is released by British broadcasters Sky News, ITV and CBS News' partner network BBC News immediately after the polls close. That poll projected Labour's victory.\n\nThe exit poll generally provides an accurate representation of the final results and can be expected by about 10 p.m. on Thursday local time (5 p.m. Eastern).\n\nU.K. election predictions and polling data\n\nPolls and political analysts have predicted for many weeks that Labour will sweep to a landslide majority in Parliament. If the latest polling data proves accurate, Sunak's 18-month tenure will end and Britons will wake up Friday morning to a new party in charge of the country for the first time in 14 years.\n\nThose 14 years of Conservative rule have been marked by political and economic turmoil, with a rotating cast of five Conservative prime ministers occupying 10 Downing Street in the last eight years alone.\n\nThe latest polling by the major independent data analysis group YouGov shows Labour in the lead by a 17-point margin, with 39% of those polled saying they intend to vote for Labour versus 22% of the public who say they will cast their votes for the Conservatives.\n\nLabour candidates are projected to win 430 seats in the House of Commons, which would be a massive 228-seat gain for the party. The Conservatives are projected to hold onto just 130 seats, which would be a seismic loss of 235 seats.\n\nWho is Keir Starmer, the likely next prime minister?\n\nStarmer was elected by party members to lead Labour in 2020, right after the party suffered its worst general election defeat in 85 years. He immediately declared it his mission to make the party \"electable\" again.\n\nFour years later Starmer, 61, is poised to take Britain's top job.\n\nHe's faced frequent criticism for a perceived lack of charisma, but his efforts to drag Labour back toward the center of British politics to give it broader voter appeal seems to have paid off.\n\nBritain's opposition Labour Party leader Keir Starmer and his wife Victoria Starmer walk outside a polling station during the general election, in London, England, July 4, 2024. Claudia Greco/REUTERS\n\nThroughout his leadership of the party, Starmer has methodically frozen out elements of Labour's far-left, socialist-leaning wing, which ran the party under previous leader Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nStarmer's deliberate shift from socialism to centrism has been criticized by pundits and voters who hew to the left, and Labour may lose some votes to smaller parties such as the Liberal Democrats and the Green Party but, given the polling, it seems to have been a winning strategy overall.\n\nIs Britain bucking the trend of Europe's shift to the right?\n\nThe expected shift to a center-left Labour government in Britain bucks the trend in Europe, as far-right parties have been on the rise across the continent in recent years.\n\nIn the first round of voting in France's parliamentary elections on Sunday, Marine Le Pen's far-right, anti-immigration National Rally Party moved within reach of becoming the largest political party in France. The party took a third of the votes in a first round that drew a historically high turnout.\n\nIf voters maintain that trend in the decisive second round of voting on July 7, it will mark an unprecedented shift to the right for the French.\n\nLast month's European parliamentary elections also saw a record number of far-right legislators win seats, with right wing candidates across Europe's three main economies \u2014 Italy, France and Germany \u2014 making gains by campaigning on opposition to issues including immigration, support for Ukraine and green environmental policies.\n\nWhile a Labour victory would be a move against those political winds on the continent, Britain has also seen a surge in support for far-right candidates in this election cycle.\n\nNigel Farage may be familiar to Americans as an ally of former President Donald Trump. His firebrand anti-immigrant rhetoric became hugely influential in the movement that led to Britain's \"Brexit\" from the European Union.\n\nAfter decades languishing on the far-right fringe of British politics, unable to win a seat in Parliament despite eight previous attempts, Farage looks set this year to finally claim the seat for his local constituency of Clacton, in southeast England.\n\nA photo posted by British politician Nigel Farage on Nov. 12, 2016 shows him standing with Donald Trump at Trump Tower in Manhattan after a private meeting with the then-U.S. president-elect. Nigel Farage/Twitter\n\nFarage's far-right Reform Party is only projected to pick up a total of about five seats in Parliament, including Farage's own, but YouGov projects overall support for Reform nationally at about 15% of the electorate, and from its current position with zero seats in the House of Commons, it seems the party is heading for a significant increase in popularity.\n\nPolitical analysts say Reform's anti-immigrant messaging is largely eating into the Conservative Party's vote share.\n\nSo while Farage won't be taking power anytime soon, it looks like he is about to step back into the limelight of British politics and, with a sizable share of public support, he may find himself wielding an outsized influence on the politics of Britain's Conservative Party as it tries to rebuild itself in the wake of what could be a devastating election.\n\nCBS News' Frank Andrews contributed to this report.",

With the Additional Member System (AMS) you choose a constituency candidate and have a second vote for your preferred party to represent you regionally. You can cast both votes for the same party or vote for different parties in your constituency and regional ballots. Regional seats are then allocated to parties on a proportional basis, taking into account the constituency MPs each party won.\n\nIt is important to note from the outset that it is impossible to predict with certainty what electoral results under different voting systems would be. This projection is merely an indication of what the results of this general election \u2013 conducted under FPTP \u2013 could have looked like using a different electoral system.\n\nIt is of course impossible to account for the other changes that would accompany a switch to an alternative electoral system, such as changes in voter behaviour, party campaigning, or the number of parties standing candidates.\n\nOur projection shows a result that is more in line with how we voted at the 2024 general election. Based on our projection, the Labour Party is still the largest party, but more in line with their percentage of the vote.\n\nWhile Labour have fewer seats, the Conservatives, Liberal Democrats, SNP, Green Party and Reform UK have shares far closer to their share of the vote.\n\nNo government should be able to win a big majority on a minority of the vote. Westminster\u2019s voting system is warping our politics and we\u2019re all paying the price. Under a proportional voting system, seats more closely match votes, so we can all have more impact on what happens in Westminster.",

        "text": "Meet the Democrats seen as up-and-comers for 2028 \u2014 or maybe sooner\nPresident Biden is adamant that he will continue his 2024 reelection bid \u2014 despite calls from some Democrats to consider dropping out because they\u2019re worried his dismal debate performance last week means the party will lose in November.\n\nRep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, was the first congressional Democrat to publicly call on Biden to step aside. Other leaders in the party have said Biden is best placed to take on former President Donald Trump.\n\nBut overall, the conversation has brought up a key question for the party: if not Biden, then who?\n\nSeveral Democrats believed to have presidential ambitions for the 2028 election have now been thrown into the spotlight as potential Biden replacements for 2024 \u2014 though all of them have declared they support the president\u2019s run.\n\nDemocratic operatives like Adrianne Shropshire, who leads BlackPAC, have said taking Biden off the top of the ticket is a bad idea for these contenders now \u2014 and in the future.\n\n\u201cWhat they don\u2019t want to do is find themselves in a place four years from now, eight years from now, when they\u2019re trying to run, and Americans, including Democrats, have lost confidence in the party itself to manage itself,\u201d Shropshire said.\n\nHere\u2019s a list of some of the names being floated:\n\nVice President Kamala Harris\n\nAlready number two on the ticket, there are several current and former Democratic leaders who have said Harris is the obvious, and only, choice to replace Biden. Harris, 59, has a national profile and name recognition that other contenders wouldn\u2019t have time to build before November.\n\nShe\u2019s been a consistently high fundraiser for Biden and the party. She has also been traveling more for the campaign, with events aimed at engaging with voters of color, younger voters and women \u2014 especially on issues of reproductive rights, a focal point for the Biden campaign since the Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs ruling in 2022.\n\nHarris, like Biden, has struggled with low approval ratings. Early on as vice president, she stumbled in her handling of the root causes of migration. But she has built up her foreign policy chops. Some in the party like close Biden ally Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., and progressive Rep. Summer Lee, D-Pa., have said they would back Harris if Biden were to step aside.\n\nHarris, though, has not wavered in supporting Biden, telling a CBS reporter this week, \u201cJoe Biden is our nominee. We beat Trump once and we are going to beat him again.\u201d\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom\n\nA former mayor of San Francisco, Newsom, 56, is in his second term as governor \u2014 surviving a recall election in 2021.

        "text": "Moderate Masoud Pezeshkian wins Iran's presidential runoff election\nReformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian won Iran's runoff presidential election Saturday, besting hard-liner Saeed Jalili by promising to reach out to the West and ease enforcement on the country's mandatory headscarf law after years of sanctions and protests squeezing the Islamic Republic.\n\nPezeshkian promised no radical changes to Iran's Shiite theocracy in his campaign and long has held Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as the final arbiter of all matters of state in the country. But even Pezeshkian's modest aims will be challenged by an Iranian government still largely held by hard-liners, the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, and Western fears over Tehran enriching uranium to near-weapons-grade levels.\n\nA vote count offered by authorities put Pezeshkian as the winner with 16.3 million votes to Jalili's 13.5 million in Friday's election.\n\nIranian reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian speaks at his rally for the presidential elections in Tehran, Iran, on July 3, 2024. Fatemeh Bahrami/Anadolu via Getty Images\n\nSupporters of Pezeshkian, a heart surgeon and longtime lawmaker, entered the streets of Tehran and other cities before dawn to celebrate as his lead grew over Jalili, a hard-line former nuclear negotiator.\n\nBut Pezeshkian's win still sees Iran at a delicate moment, with tensions high in the Mideast over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, Iran's advancing nuclear program, and a looming U.S. election that could put any chance of a detente between Tehran and Washington at risk.\n\nThe first round of voting June 28 saw the lowest turnout in the history of the Islamic Republic since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Iranian officials have long pointed to turnout as a sign of support for the country's Shiite theocracy, which has been under strain after years of sanctions crushing Iran's economy, mass demonstrations and intense crackdowns on all dissent.\n\nGovernment officials up to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei predicted a higher participation rate as voting got underway, with state television airing images of modest lines at some polling centers across the country.\n\nHowever, online videos purported to show some polls empty while a survey of several dozen sites in the capital, Tehran, saw light traffic amid a heavy security presence on the streets.\n\nThe election came amid heightened regional tensions. In April, Iran launched its first-ever direct attack on Israel over the war in Gaza, while militia groups that Tehran arms in the region \u2014 such as the Lebanese Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthi rebels \u2014 are engaged in the fighting and have escalated their attacks.\n\nIran is also enriching uranium at near weapons-grade levels and maintains a stockpile large enough to build several nuclear weapons, should it choose to do so. And while Khamenei remains the final decision-maker on matters of state, whichever man ends up winning the presidency could bend the country's foreign policy toward either confrontation or collaboration with the West.\n\nThe campaign also repeatedly touched on what would happen if former President Donald Trump, who unilaterally withdrew America from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018, won the November election. Iran has held indirect talks with President Joe Biden's administration, though there's been no clear movement back toward constraining Tehran's nuclear program for the lifting of economic sanctions.\n\nMore than 61 million Iranians over the age of 18 were eligible to vote, with about 18 million of them between 18 and 30. Voting was to end at 6 p.m. but was extended until midnight to boost participation.\n\nThe late President Ebrahim Raisi, who died in a May helicopter crash, was seen as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Khamenei and a potential successor as supreme leader.\n\nStill, many knew him for his involvement in the mass executions that Iran conducted in 1988, and for his role in the bloody crackdowns on dissent that followed protests over the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman detained by police over allegedly improperly wearing the mandatory headscarf, or hijab.",

Since then the regime has worked hard to ensure that the July 28 presidential election is not fair. For example, it barred the leading opposition candidate, Maria Corina Machado, from running, and in May the regime revoked its invitation to the EU to observe the election. And as an article in Americas Quarterly noted, \u201cNicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s regime is also taking steps to block Venezuelans\u2019 access to ballot boxes at home and abroad.\u201d\n\nOn July 3rd, the EU issued a statement in which it \u201cexpresses its deep concern with the decisions intended to prevent members of the opposition from exercising their core political rights, as has been the case of Mar\u00eda Corina Machado and other political figures. These decisions undermine democracy and the rule of law and will only deepen the longstanding political and social crisis in Venezuela.\u201d\n\nPressure Points Abrams gives his take on U.S. foreign policy, with special focus on the Middle East and democracy and human rights issues.\n\nYet the United States sought a meeting with Maduro regime officials, and it was held (virtually) on July 3. To repeat, it was not Maduro who sought the meeting but the United States. Why? According to Reuters, a White House spokesman said of Wednesday's meeting that \"We discussed a wide range of issues and continued to urge competitive and inclusive elections on July 28 in Venezuela.\u201d\n\nUrging free elections on Nicolas Maduro is about as useful as urging them on Cuba\u2019s president. Meanwhile, the lawyer and scholar Rocio San Miguel, seized by police on February 9, remains in the hellish El Helicoide prison\u2014detained, as Amnesty International put it, \u201cfor defending human rights in Venezuela.\u201d One hopes, without much confidence, that among the \u201cwide range of issues\u201d raised in the U.S.-Maduro talks was her detention\u2014and that of hundreds of other political prisoners.\n\nVenezuela\u2019s oil production rose from around 400,000 barrels per day when President Biden entered office to double that today\u2014a period in which repression also grew steadily. During 2023, as Reuters reported, \u201cVenezuela's oil exports increased 12%...to almost 700,000 barrels per day (bpd) as the United States eased sanctions\u2026.\u201d Production increases continued in 2024, and \u201cUS oil giant Chevron, which received a limited license to reactivate extraction and sales from its Venezuelan operations in November 2022, recently announced plans to drill 30 new wells in the crude-rich Orinoco Oil Belt.\u201d\n\nWhy is this in the interest of the United States? With global crude oil production of over 80 million barrels per day, and total liquid fuels production over 100 million barrels per day, these Venezuelan increases in production will not affect U.S. and global oil prices, so any Biden administration thinking that concessions to Maduro will help keep U.S. gasoline prices down until the U.S. election is simply foolish. Equally foolish is the notion that such meetings with Maduro regime officials will produce improved human rights conditions or a free election.\n\nWhat they can do is undermine the democratic opposition. I wonder if the opposition was consulted by the Biden administration and asked if they thought holding such a meeting three weeks before the Venezuelan election was wise. I wonder if there was a serious meeting between U.S. officials and opposition leaders to discuss the positions U.S. officials would take with the regime: what priorities, what strategies? I wonder if there has been or will be a full report to the democratic opposition leaders as to what transpired between U.S. officials and Maduro\u2019s representatives. Given the Biden administration\u2019s treatment of the opposition in the last three and half years, one is entitled to harbor doubts.\n\nI will be delighted to withdraw all this criticism if the election on July 28 is remotely fair and the opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez is \u201cpermitted\u201d to win. Every poll shows him way ahead. Then the Biden administration can assist in a smooth transition back to democracy in Venezuela and critics like me will apologize. But it is far more likely that the regime will claim victory, and then what will the Biden administration do? Recognize the failure of its policies, reimpose sanctions, and seek to organize the democracies of Latin America and the rest of the world against the regime? Or will it slowly make its peace with Maduro, lifting more sanctions and eventually sending a U.S. ambassador back to Caracas and allowing Maduro to take over the Venezuelan embassy in Washington?\n\nThat\u2019s no doubt Maduro\u2019s thinking. Perhaps in the July 3 meeting, U.S. officials not only demanded a free election, but also spoke about transitions (accompanied by amnesties) that would ease Maduro and his cohorts out, and promised to launch a powerful new effort against the regime if it steals the election. Perhaps U.S. officials explained how a transition could be made to work, while theft of the election would bring down retribution. Perhaps--and I wish I believed that. But looking at the Biden administration\u2019s record on Venezuela over the last three and a half years, the signs unfortunately point in a different direction.",

        "text": "Landslide victory\nElection result wherein a party or candidate wins by a large margin\n\nA landslide victory is an election result in which the winning candidate or party achieves a decisive victory by an overwhelming margin, securing a very large majority of votes or seats far beyond the typical competitive outcome.[1][2][3][4] The term became popular in the 1800s to describe a victory in which the opposition is \"buried\",[1] similar to the way in which a geological landslide buries whatever is in its path. A landslide victory for one party is often accompanied by an electoral wipeout for the opposition, as the overwhelming support for the winning side inflicts a decisive loss on its rivals. What qualifies as a landslide victory can vary depending on the type of electoral system, as the term does not entail a precise, technical, or universally agreed-upon measurement. Instead, it is used informally in everyday language, making it subject to interpretation. Even within a single electoral system, there is no consensus on the exact margin that constitutes a landslide victory.[1]\n\nA landslide victory implies a powerful expression of popular will and a ringing endorsement by the electorate for the winner\u2019s political platform. Such a decisive outcome can lead the winner to interpret it as a mandate or a tacit authorization from the public to implement their proposed policies and pursue their agenda with confidence. Emboldened by the result, the winner may undertake ambitious reforms or significant policy shifts to reflect the electorate\u2019s desire for meaningful change.[5]\n\nA combination of factors\u2013such as charismatic leadership, a favorable shift in public sentiment driven by dissatisfaction with the status quo, strategic electoral campaigning and a positive media portrayal\u2013can create the conditions necessary for a landslide victory. Such a victory may fundamentally reshape the political landscape of a country, for example Franklin D. Roosevelt's election as US president in 1932.[6] In this imbalanced landscape, the winning party could implement policies more easily, facing little resistance, while the severely weakened opposition may struggle to perform essential checks and balances.\n\nNotable examples [ edit ]\n\nAustralia [ edit ]\n\nLocal and mayoral elections:\n\nState and territory elections:\n\n2021 Western Australian state election \u2013 Mark McGowan led the Labor Party to win 53 out of the 59 seats in the lower house. The Labor Party had a primary vote of 59.92% and a two-party-preferred vote of 69.68%. The National Party won 4 seats and the Liberal Party won 2 seats, making the National Party the official opposition, the first time they had held this status since the 1940s. To date, the election is the most decisive result at any Australian state or federal election since Federation, in terms of both percentage of lower house seats controlled by the governing party (89.8%) and two-party preferred margin. [ 9 ] [ 10 ]\n\nMap displaying Labor's landslide victory at the 2021 Western Australian state election. Seats won by Labor are in red, seats won by the Liberals are in blue and seats won by the Nationals are in green.\n\nBarbados [ edit ]\n\nIn Barbadian general elections, a landslide victory involves a large swing from one party to another as well as one party winning a large majority in parliament. Landslide victories have usually occurred after a long period of government from one particular party and a change in the popular mood.\n\nBrazil [ edit ]\n\nMap by municipalities of FHC's landslide victory in 1998.\n\nCanada [ edit ]\n\nA map of the vote by province in 1940 shows the scale of the Liberals' landslide victory.\n\nA map of the vote by province in 1984 shows the scale of the Progressive Conservatives' landslide victory.\n\nIn a Canadian federal election, a landslide victory occurs when a political party gains a significant majority of the House of Commons of Canada.\n\nLandslide victories may also occur during provincial elections, and territorial elections in Yukon. Landslide victories are not possible for territorial elections in the Northwest Territories, and Nunavut, as its members are elected without reference to political parties, operating as a consensus government.\n\nNational landslide victories [ edit ]\n\nThe following Canadian federal elections resulted in landslide victories:[11]\n\n1874 \u2013 The Liberals won 133 seats while the Conservatives won just 73 seats.\n\n1878 \u2013 The Conservatives won 137 seats while the Liberals won just 69 seats.\n\n1882 \u2013 The Conservatives won 139 seats while the Liberals won just 71 seats.\n\n1900 \u2013 The Liberals won 132 seats while the Conservatives won just 81.\n\n1904 \u2013 The Liberals won 139 seats while the Conservatives won just 75.\n\n1908 \u2013 The Liberals won 133 seats while the Conservatives won just 85.\n\n1911 \u2013 The Conservatives won 133 seats while the Liberals won just 86.\n\n1917 \u2013 The Conservatives won 153 seats while the Liberals won just 82.\n\n1930 \u2013 The Conservatives won 137 seats while the Liberals won just 91.\n\n1935 \u2013 The Liberals won 171 seats while the Conservatives won just 39.\n\n1940 \u2013 The Liberals won 178 seats while the Progressive Conservatives won just 39.\n\n1949 \u2013 The Liberals won 190 seats while the Progressive Conservatives won just 41.\n\n1953 \u2013 The Liberals won 171 seats while the Progressive Conservatives won just 51.\n\n1958 \u2013 The Progressive Conservatives won 208 seats while the Liberals won just 48.\n\n1968 \u2013 The Liberals won 155 seats while the Progressive Conservatives won just 72.\n\n1984 \u2013 The Progressive Conservatives won 211 seats while the Liberals won just 40.\n\n1993 \u2013 The Liberals won 177 seats while the Bloc Qu\u00e9becois, which ran only in Quebec, won 54. The ruling Progressive Conservatives dropped from 154 to 2. This is considered as the last landslide Canadian federal election.\n\nProvincial examples [ edit ]\n\nCosta Rica [ edit ]\n\nCroatia [ edit ]\n\nResults in all of Croatia's counties: the counties in blue voted for Tu\u0111man, and Istria County voted for Gotovac (marked in yellow).\n\nDominica [ edit ]\n\nFiji [ edit ]\n\nFinland [ edit ]\n\nFrance [ edit ]\n\nOnly include those after 1958.\n\nFrench Polynesia [ edit ]\n\nGrenada [ edit ]\n\nIn Grenadian general elections, a landslide victory involves a large swing from one party to another as well as one party winning a large majority in parliament. Landslide victories have usually occurred after a long period of government from one particular party and a change in the popular mood.\n\nHong Kong [ edit ]\n\nLegislative Council elections:\n\n1991 \u2013 The pro-democracy camp won 16 of the 18 directly elected geographical constituency seats, with a coalition of the United Democrats of Hong Kong and the Meeting Point taking 14 of the seats.\n\n1995 \u2013 The pro-democracy camp swept 16 of the 20 directly elected geographical constituency seats in which the Democratic Party alone took 12 directly elected seats.\n\n2021 \u2013 The pro-Beijing camp took 89 out of 90 seats in the Legislative Council. Many democratic candidates had been barred from running, and turnout was extremely low.\n\nLocal elections:\n\n2019 \u2013 The pro-democracy camp seized control of 17 of the 18 District Councils, tripling their seats from about 124 to 389. The pro-Beijing parties and independents won only 61 seats, a loss of 242 seats, received their largest defeat in history.\n\nHungary [ edit ]\n\n2010 \u2013 Fidesz\u2013KDNP won 262 of the 386 seats thus being the first party to win a super-majority since 1990.\n\n2022 \u2013 Despite an electoral alliance of almost all opposition parties, Fidesz\u2013KDNP won 135 of the 199 seats thus winning a super-majority for the fourth time in a row.\n\nIreland [ edit ]\n\nThe 1977 Irish general election, which elected members of the 21st D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann on 16 June 1977, resulted in a landslide win for the main opposition party Fianna F\u00e1il. The election saw the party win 84 seats in the 148 D\u00e1il, receiving 50.6% of all first preference votes cast. The incumbent Fine Gael/Labour National Coalition government was defeated, with Fianna F\u00e1il gaining a 20-seat majority in the lower house of the Oireachtas (Ireland's national parliament). This was the last time a single political party won an outright majority in an Irish general election.\n\nItaly [ edit ]\n\n2005 Italian regional elections \u2013 The Union centre-left coalition won the presidency in 12 out of 14 regions that were holding elections that year. After this election the centre-left controlled the presidency in 16 out of Italy's 20 regions.\n\n2020 Venetian regional election \u2013 Incumbent president of Veneto Luca Zaia (Lega) won carrying 76.79% of the vote, five times as many as his main opponent Arturo Lorenzoni's (PD) 15.72%.\n\nJamaica [ edit ]\n\nIn Jamaican elections, a landslide victory involves a large swing from one party to another as well as one party winning a large majority in parliament. Landslide victories have usually occurred after a long period of government from one particular party and a change in the popular mood.\n\nMalaysia [ edit ]\n\nMexico [ edit ]\n\nMonaco [ edit ]\n\nMonaco is traditionally dominated by conservative parties with only two cases in which left-of-centre parties won any seats (1963 and 1973).\n\nNew Zealand [ edit ]\n\nUntil 1993, New Zealand used the traditional first-past-the-post system as in the U.K. to determine representation in its Parliament. Thus, landslide elections at that time were defined in an identical fashion, i.e. where one party got an overwhelming majority of the seats. Since 1996, New Zealand has used the mixed member proportional system as in Germany, making landslides much less likely.[17]\n\nFirst past the post\n\nMMP\n\nPapua New Guinea [ edit ]\n\nParaguay [ edit ]\n\nPhilippines [ edit ]\n\nRamon Magsaysay (light green)'s 1953 landslide victory.\n\nIn 1941, the Nacionalista Party won the presidency, vice presidency, all seats in the Senate, and all but 3 seats in the House of Representatives. This was the biggest landslide in Philippine history. The legislators didn't serve until 1945 though, due to World War II.\n\nStarting in 1987, the Philippines evolved into a multi-party system, and coupled with the introduction of party-list elections in 1998, no party was able to win a landslide, much less a majority of seats, in the House of Representatives since then. This has also meant, until 2022, that no presidential and vice presidential election winner won a majority of votes, although, in 1998, the winners were described as having landslide victories, despite winning less than a majority of votes, due to large winning margins. Senatorial landslides are more possible though in midterm elections, as voters are usually presented with two distinct choices. The 2022 presidential election was the first landslide since 1987.\n\nPresidential and vice presidential elections\n\nIn the Philippines, while there are presidential tickets, the positions of president and vice president are elected separately.\n\nSenate\n\nHouse of Representatives\n\nPortugal [ edit ]\n\nLegislative Elections\n\nDistrict map that shows the scale of the 1991 Social Democrats' landslide victory.\n\nDistrict map that shows the scale of the 2022 Socialists' landslide victory.\n\nPresidential Elections\n\nAzorean Regional Elections\n\nMadeiran Regional Elections\n\nAlberto Jo\u00e3o Jardim, member of the Social Democratic Party (PSD) was the president of the Madeira region from 1978 to 2015. During this period of time, landslide victories for the Social Democrats were the norm. In 2015, the party, now led by Miguel Albuquerque, also achieved a landslide victory.\n\nSamoa [ edit ]\n\nSlovakia [ edit ]\n\nSpain [ edit ]\n\nBasque Country [ edit ]\n\n2001 \u2013 Juan Jose Ibarretxe's Basque National Party-Basque Solidarity (PNV-EA) alliance won 33 seats and 42.2% of the share, 20 percentage points ahead of PP. The result is the best performance for the top voted list in a Basque regional election. With a record turnout of 79%, PNV-EA obtained more than 600,000 votes. PNV-EA also won more seats than PP (19) and PSE-EE (13) together, and was able to secure a working majority in parliament.\n\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines [ edit ]\n\nA landslide victory in the elections of St. Vincent and the Grenadines involves a large swing from one party to another as well as one party winning a large majority in parliament. Landslide victories have usually occurred after a long period of government from one particular party and a change in the popular mood.\n\nTaiwan [ edit ]\n\nIn the 2020 election, the Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen won 8.17 million votes, 57.1% of the votes cast, a historic landslide victory.\n\nPresidential and Legislative Election held on the same day\n\nTrinidad and Tobago [ edit ]\n\nIn Trinidad and Tobago's elections, a landslide victory involves a large swing from one party to another as well as one party winning a large majority in parliament. Landslide victories have usually occurred after a long period of government from one particular party and a change in the popular mood. Party politics and the political structure in Trinidad and Tobago has generally run along ethnic lines with most Afro-Trinidadians supporting the People's National Movement (PNM) and most Indo-Trinidadians supporting various Indian-majority parties, such as the current United National Congress (UNC) or its predecessors.\n\nTobago\n\nUkraine [ edit ]\n\n2019 Ukrainian presidential election \u2013 Volodymyr Zelenskyy won all regions but one and 73.22% of the popular vote in the second round of the election, unseating incumbent Petro Poroshenko, who received 24.45% of the popular vote.\n\nUnited Kingdom [ edit ]\n\nThis map shows the Conservative Party landslide victory in 2019.\n\nThis map shows the Labour Party landslide victory in 2024.\n\nIn UK General Elections, a landslide victory involves winning a large majority in parliament and often goes with a large swing from one party to another as well. Landslide victories have usually occurred after a long period of government from one particular party and a change in the popular mood. In the past a majority of over 100 was regarded as the technical hurdle to be defined as a landslide, as that allows the government freedom to easily enact its policies in parliament. In more recent times, the label 'landslide' has been applied in numerous press articles to victories which would not previously have been regarded as such, for example the Conservative Party majority of 80 in 2019. Its current usage is more as political commentary rather than technical definition and is a reflection of the strength of the party's ability to put its programme through parliament.[24][25][26][27]\n\nThe largest landslide by any single party in the UK parliament, since universal suffrage was introduced, was the majority of 179 won by Tony Blair's Labour Party in 1997.\n\nNotable landslide election results\n\nUnited States [ edit ]\n\nThe map of the Electoral College in 1936 shows the scale of Franklin D. Roosevelt's landslide victory.\n\nThe map of the Electoral College in 1964 shows the scale of Lyndon B. Johnson's landslide victory.\n\nThe map of the Electoral College in 1972 shows the scale of Richard Nixon's landslide victory.\n\nThe map of the Electoral College in 1984 shows the scale of Ronald Reagan's landslide victory.\n\nA landslide victory in U.S. Presidential elections occurs when a candidate has an overwhelming majority in the Electoral College.\n\nSee also [ edit ]",

Already, a number of left-wing politicians have ruled out supporting any potential bid for prime minister he might decide to make.\n\nThe NFP lays claim to the right to nominate a prime minister and while they are short of an absolute majority, Macron will only be able to nominate someone who is likely to receive support from a number of political factions.\n\nOver in the presidential camp, 30 executives from Macron's Renaissance party are meeting at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e this afternoon in order to take stock of the situation.\n\nAs for the National Rally, it is unlikely to find enough support among other parties and groupings to put forward a candidate from within its ranks.",

        "text": "Understanding disengaged voters and their role in the 2024 election\nDisengaged voters are emerging as a critical and potentially decisive group in the 2024 presidential race. So who are these people? Disengaged voters can be thought of as people who are registered to vote but do not follow politics closely. Demographically, disengaged voters more often are younger, more often are women, and are less likely to have a college degree than politically engaged voters. Although for most of the last decade these voters have been more supportive of Donald Trump, net support among disengaged voters for Joe Biden relative to Trump has increased 16 percentage points since Trump\u2019s felony conviction.\n\nWho are disengaged voters?\n\nAlthough Americans have been characterized as uniquely engaged in civics and political society, this characterization does not apply to all voters. Politically disengaged voters \u2014 often called low information voters \u2014 can be thought of as people who might vote but do not follow politics closely and may have little civic knowledge.\n\nSo who counts as a disengaged voter? It can be a fuzzy concept, and there is no consensus on exactly how to define it. First, disengaged voters are often limited to those who say they are registered to vote, though some polling organizations have more complex ways of determining whether or not someone is likely to vote. When talking about disengagement, or having low information, academics often use brief tests of political knowledge, such as asking whether people know the length of a U.S. senator\u2019s term. Pollsters sometimes use political knowledge tests, but more often they simply ask how much people report following political news. For reference, about 20% of registered voters say they pay attention to politics \"only now and then\" or \"hardly at all,\" while the rest say they follow politics at least some of the time. But are self-reports of following political news the same as testing political knowledge? While not exactly the same, they may be effectively interchangeable for defining disengaged voters. That is, people who follow politics less will most likely have lower political knowledge, and vice versa.\n\nTo explore how similar these measures of political engagement are, a recent YouGov survey tested respondents\u2019 political knowledge and also asked them how much they pay attention to politics in general and to the 2024 election specifically. Respondents were asked 23 questions about politics in general and the 2024 presidential election, including who the Democratic and Republican candidates for president are, which political party controls the House of Representatives and which controls the Senate, which party generally supports various policies, whether the national political conventions have happened yet, and whether each presidential candidate is facing legal issues such as being convicted of a crime.\n\nIf we think of disengaged voters as those who do not follow politics and lack political knowledge, then people who say they have lower political engagement should score lower, on average, on political knowledge tests. Results support this: Registered voters who say they follow political news only now and then or hardly at all score an average of 54% on the political knowledge test, almost 20 points lower than the average score for all registered voters (72%). Similarly, those who are paying little attention to the 2024 election score 56%. The largest percentage of registered voters know the date of the next U.S. election, with 95% correctly identifying it as this year. The fewest voters \u2014 40% \u2014 knew that at the time of the poll, the Democratic vice presidential candidate had been officially announced (and 88% of them knew it was Kamala Harris).\n\nPolitical knowledge scores, attention to political news in general, and attention to the 2024 election each correlate with each other at a level of above r = 0.5, meaning that people who pay more attention to politics are more likely to score highly on political knowledge tests and vice versa. Essentially, these measures increase together, indicating that they are closely related aspects of political engagement. Despite sometimes being conflated with low education, the extent to which one follows political news is a better predictor of political knowledge test scores than education level is, aligning with previous research finding that disengaged or low information voters are not merely those with less education.",

        "text": "French Parliamentary Elections 2024: Macron Faces Reality Check and Limits to His Vision\nAll eyes were on France this weekend as the country voted on the new composition of the parliament. Following the defeat of his party in the European Parliament elections in June, French President Emmanuel Macron called snap elections in a bid to shore up his support and ensure he could continue his second term from a position of power. The first round of these snap elections a week ago resulted in disaster and panic for Macron\u2019s centrist party, which slumped to third place. The National Rally, France\u2019s far-right party that has openly questioned the country\u2019s NATO and EU memberships, was the clear winner from the first round as the top party, with widespread concerns they would perform as well in round two. In the last week, Macron\u2019s centrists and the left alliance, the New Popular Front (NPF), scrambled with one goal\u2013prevent the National Rally from entering government. In the end, the two parties kept the National Rally from gaining power, but now Macron is likely facing a hung parliament and political gridlock. In the coming weeks, Macron and the left-wing alliance will either try to form a minority government, enter into an uneasy coalition with a cohabitation government (with the prime minister role held by the left), or a technocratic government of experts may emerge as the only viable path forward. The rebalance of power after the elections will limit Macron's ambitions and leadership, impacting attempts to create a more geopolitical European Union and limiting French support for Ukraine.\n\nWhat led Macron to call snap elections?\n\nWhat led Macron to call for parliamentary elections in the first place? He was only recently voted into his second term in 2022 and the next elections are not scheduled until 2027. The European Parliament elections in June and his party\u2019s poor performance prompted the decision, amidst the groundswell of the far-right National Rally party, which came in first with 31.4% of the vote. The National Rally received the highest vote share in the party\u2019s history and twice as much as Macron\u2019s party in the European Parliament elections. Macron\u2019s unexpected decision to call for snap legislative elections in the aftermath of this historic defeat took everyone by surprise. In the 2022 election cycle, Macron\u2019s coalition failed to win an outright parliamentary majority, leading to difficulty passing certain bills. To pass controversial bills like his pension reform, Macron has increasingly had to bypass Parliament and resort to presidential decree, which has provoked outrage in opposition parties and in public opinion.\n\nWhat did he hope to achieve with these snap parliamentary elections? One theory holds that Macron was gambling that he could defeat the \u201cextremist\u201d parties by exposing them to the government. As Marine Le Pen, leader of the National Rally, is increasingly seen as a viable candidate for president in 2027 with Macron unable to stand for a third term, this election forced her party into the limelight ahead of this critical presidential election. Out of office, both the hard left and the far-right have been able to rail against Macron\u2019s policies and make promises of their own. Macron\u2019s plan could have been to bet that once in office, they will run into constraints and may find themselves unable to deliver on their promises, or risk being viewed as incompetent. The rationale was that relinquishing some power now may give Macron\u2019s party a better chance of retaining power in 2027 for someone else from Macron\u2019s centrist party to run for office.\n\nAnother theory suggests France might soon have been forced to the polls anyway. Every time Macron passes a law by presidential decree, under article 49.3 of the French Constitution the Parliament can hold a vote of confidence in his government. Perhaps Macron considered that the government may not have survived another vote of confidence, and he judged better to call for snap elections himself rather than being pushed into it. Macron was under no obligation to dissolve Parliament, even if the European vote reduced his credibility for the three remaining years of his presidential term. He, however, believed that a dissolution had become inevitable and that a snap election was the only way to respect the will of the people. Macron presented this election to voters as a stark choice between him or the political extremes.\n\nFrance votes and rejects the far-right\n\nIn an unexpected turn of events, the left-wing alliance shocked onlookers and took the top place in the parliamentary elections. No single party had an outright majority, but the centrists and leftists succeeded in bumping the far-right from first place to third place. The National Rally party still gained more than 50 seats since France last held parliamentary elections in 2022\u2013a worrying trend showing the party may not have won this battle, but the war is far from over.\n\nFrance now finds itself in a state of political paralysis and gridlock. Macron\u2019s Prime Minister, Gabriel Attal, offered his resignation but Macron asked him to help oversee a caretaker government through the Olympics. In the ensuing weeks, a new prime minister from the left-wing New Popular Front will be chosen, which leads to what is called a cohabitation in France. A cohabitation between a president from one party and a prime minister from another is uncommon in modern French political history. It happened most recently when Jacques Chirac, a center-right Gaullist, governed with a Socialist prime minister, Lionel Jospin, between 1997 and 2002. Although the ideological discrepancy between a president and a prime minister would have been more severe if the prime minister was from the National Rally, the far-left may prove equally difficult to cooperate with for Macron. The New Popular Front, consisting of multiple left-leaning parties encompassing a wide array of disparate views, did not receive enough votes for a majority government. In the ensuing weeks, a minority government may attempt to govern (with the possibility of a vote of no confidence in the National Assembly). The NPF has ruled out entering into a coalition government with the centrists. They will seek to implement their agenda, including radical reforms to the French economy in direct opposition to Macron\u2019s recent changes to the retirement age and pension reform. The left-wing alliance were united under a common banner to prevent the National Rally from winning, but now their internal divisions are already on display as they decide who to put forward as their prime minister.\n\nThe choice of prime minister will directly impact Macron\u2019s leadership at home and abroad. There is a division of labor between the president and the prime minister in France. The former has the monopoly over foreign policy while the latter oversees domestic policy. The prime minister has core national defense responsibilities, and control over the budget and the administration. While the president has broad abilities to govern by presidential decree, the approval of Parliament, especially of the National Assembly, is required on most major domestic policy changes and key pieces of legislation, including spending bills. Moreover, the National Assembly members can topple a French cabinet with a no-confidence vote, and it gets the final word if the two houses of Parliament disagree on a bill. The composition of the National Assembly therefore determines how France is governed. Although Macron would retain some powers over foreign policy and would remain commander-in-chief, the next prime minister would likely constrain Macron. Fundamentally, the new prime minister would likely come from the left-wing alliance with different priorities and policies running in parallel or at odds with Macron\u2019s. This state of paralysis will impact Macron\u2019s leadership on the EU level and limit the numerous initiatives he has undertaken to increase European strategic autonomy.\n\nWhat does this mean for Macron\u2019s vision for Europe?\n\nDespite the National Rally not coming out on top, Macron will still confront a Parliament questioning his policies. On the EU agenda, Macron has been energetically pro-European, and has been seen as a major driver of strengthening European defense cooperation, including the European pillar of NATO. Macron\u2019s view is that the EU is being severely tested by the Russian war in Ukraine, and that the way forward is to unite and pool its military and industrial resources. This view about the dire need to defend and support Ukraine is overall shared by the New Popular Front, despite some nuances and disagreements between the parties forming the coalition. However, the EU agenda of the New Popular Front differs from the President\u2019s on a number of issues, such as trade, the Common Agriculture Policy, the fight against climate change, and taxation. Indeed, the left-wing alliance is more radical and ambitious, but the reality is that it would be even more complex to reach political consensus on those files with the new fragmented National Assembly. When it comes to the National Rally\u2019s agenda, they have stated nations should reassert themselves against European federalism and against globalization. The party wants to strictly control borders, resist what they denounce as \u201cpunitive\u201d ecological measures emanating from Brussels that it says drive up prices, and prevent what it sees as the dilution of nationhood through immigration. The National Rally is overall skeptical of France\u2019s engagement with both the EU and NATO. However, without an actively engaged France, both would be significantly weakened, especially the EU. Macron\u2019s gamble\u2013likely leading to institutional blockade\u2013therefore risked plunging France into political, social, and economic turmoil.\n\nFrance is not the only country reeling from the recent European Parliament elections\u2013the German Chancellor Scholz\u2019s governing three-party coalition suffered a crushing blow as well. The fact that France could be facing a prolonged governmental crisis is bad news for the Franco-German engine of the EU. As EU institutions are transitioning to a new Commission with the new five year-mandate, the EU will need strong support from member states, especially France, to tackle pressing global challenges. The newly revitalized Weimar Triangle format\u2013 that includes France, Germany, and Poland\u2013will be under increased strain. The triumvirate will need to rise above the fallout of the European Parliament elections to support Ukraine, EU enlargement, institutional reform to make an enlarged union function more effectively, strengthen the EU defense industry, and the next seven-year budget. A weakened or constrained government in France and Germany is not a good sign for EU progress on any of those issues.\n\nAlthough the elections could have gone much worse for President Macron, this by no means was a victory for his centrist party nor for his vision of a stronger Europe. Macron\u2019s centrists and the left-wing New Popular Front succeeded in keeping the National Rally from fully enfeebling Macron\u2019s next three years in the presidency. Once the dust settles and a new prime minister is appointed, Macron will have to determine how much of his vision he can act on and he will likely need to limit some of his ambition. Ultimately, the National Rally has been defeated but is not gone forever, there is a very real chance that their wave of support will continue to gain momentum on the way to the next major elections in 2027.",

        "text": "Democrats look towards Kamala Harris\nDemocrats look to Kamala Harris - but could she beat Trump?\n\nBBC\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, US Vice-President Kamala Harris sat on stage at a black cultural festival in New Orleans, talking about her life story and what she felt she had achieved in the White House. It was the kind of event that the first female, black and South Asian American vice-president has regularly attended throughout her three-and-a-half years as Joe Biden\u2019s deputy, usually trailed by a small press pack dwarfed by that which follows the president himself. But as panicked Democrats a thousand miles away in Washington weighed replacing 81-year-old Joe Biden as the party\u2019s candidate for November\u2019s election following his woeful and sometimes incomprehensible debate performance against Donald Trump, the number of reporters trailing Ms Harris had swelled to dozens. On stage and through her travels this weekend, the vice-president did not address swirling questions about Mr Biden\u2019s fitness for office and whether he should withdraw and hand the baton to her. But in discussing ambition and how to forge your own path with her audience in New Orleans, she encouraged the crowd not to listen to naysayers. \u201cPeople in your life will tell you, though, it\u2019s not your time. It\u2019s not your turn. Nobody like you has done it before,\" she said. \"Don\u2019t you ever listen to that.\" Since the disastrous CNN debate on 27 June, she has repeatedly defended her boss, arguing that his record as president shouldn\u2019t be outweighed by 90 minutes on a debate stage. Mr Biden himself has struck a defiant tone and fiercely insisted that he will remain the nominee. Yet as calls grow louder for the president to step aside, some high-profile Democrats are unifying behind 59-year-old Ms Harris as the natural candidate to replace him. On Sunday, congressman Adam Schiff of California told NBC's Meet The Press that either Mr Biden had to be able to \u201cwin overwhelmingly or he has to pass the torch to someone who can\u201d. Kamala Harris, he added, could \u201cvery well win overwhelmingly\u201d against Trump. That\u2019s a proposition that has raised eyebrows among some Democrats, including Biden allies, who see in Ms Harris a vice-president who failed in her bid for the 2020 Democratic nomination before the first ballot was even cast and who has struggled with an uneven record and low approval ratings throughout her time in the White House. Against that, senior Democratic lawmakers like Mr Schiff and South Carolina congressman Jim Clyburn have been floating Ms Harris as the obvious successor should Mr Biden ultimately bow to party pressure.\n\nGetty Images Some Democratic heavyweights have thrown their support behind Kamala Harris should Joe Biden step aside\n\nSupporters point to a handful of polls that suggest she would perform better than the president in a hypothetical match-up against Donald Trump, and they argue she has the national profile, campaign infrastructure and appeal to younger voters that could make the transition seamless four months before election day. An elevation to the top of the ticket would be a remarkable turnaround for a woman not long ago seen as a political weakness by senior figures in the Biden White House. Even Mr Biden himself reportedly described her as a \u201cwork in progress\" during their first months in office. But Jamal Simmons, a longtime Democratic strategist and Harris\u2019s former communications director, said she had long been underestimated. \u201cWhether she\u2019s a partner to the president or she has to lead the ticket, she is somebody who Republicans and the Trump campaign need to take seriously,\u201d Mr Simmons told the BBC. Since the debate and its fall-out, Ms Harris has altered her schedule to stick close to the president. She appeared at a heavily-scrutinised meeting last Wednesday where Mr Biden sought to reassure powerful Democratic governors about his fitness for office. And a day later, on the Fourth of July - America\u2019s Independence Day - she abandoned her usual tradition of grilling hotdogs for firefighters and Secret Service agents at her Los Angeles home to be by Mr Biden\u2019s side at the White House celebrations. The former top prosecutor has focused on criticising Trump in public appearances since the debate, pressing the case as to why voters should believe he is a threat to democracy and women\u2019s rights. At the same time, she has offered nothing but steadfast support for Mr Biden. Vice-presidents always need to strike a delicate balancing act between ambition and loyalty, but Ms Harris knows that this is not a moment where she can show any daylight between her and the president.\n\nGetty Images Her unpopularity as vice-president is a worry to Democrats assessing if Harris can actually beat Donald Trump\n\nKamala Harris is, however, far from the only alternative to Mr Biden being discussed. The list of potential Biden replacements ranges from a cadre of popular governors - Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Gavin Newsom of California, Pennsylvania\u2019s Josh Shapiro and Illinois\u2019 JB Pritzker - to Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and California congressman Ro Khanna. Ms Harris and her staff have refused to engage in public speculation. But her team is keenly aware of the behind-the-scenes conversations taking place as some party members coalesce behind her. A memo circulated online, purportedly written by Democratic operatives, laid out a detailed argument to promote Ms Harris despite her \u201creal political weaknesses\u201d. Trying to choose anyone other than her would throw the campaign into disarray and keep \"Democratic bickering\" in the media spotlight for months, it argues. If Mr Biden were to give up the nomination, the idea of the Democrats passing over Ms Harris in favour of another candidate appalls many on the left of the party and in its powerful black caucus. In that situation, \"this party should not in any way do anything to work around Ms Harris\", Mr Clyburn, one of the most prominent black lawmakers in Congress, told MSNBC last week. Republicans, too, have acknowledged Ms Harris would be the frontrunner to replace Mr Biden. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina warned on Sunday that Republicans must be ready for a \u201cdramatically different race\u201d should Ms Harris - whom he described as a \u201cvigorous\u201d candidate - become the nominee. Mr Graham emphasised her progressive California brand, suggesting she was closer in policy terms to left-wing firebrand Bernie Sanders than Joe Biden, in what appeared to be a glimpse of a Republican attack line should she become the candidate. For his part, Donald Trump has called her \u201cpathetic\u201d in the days since the debate. But ultimately the only question that matters for many Democrats - including deep-pocketed donors - is if she has a better chance of beating Trump than Joe Biden does. And that is deeply uncertain. Harris backers point to a recent CNN poll suggesting she would fare better than the president against Trump in November. In a head-to-head contest, Ms Harris trailed the Republican by only two points, while Mr Biden lagged six points behind him. The poll also suggested Ms Harris performed better than Mr Biden with independent voters and women. But many polling experts dismiss such hypothetical surveys, noting voter sentiment would change if Mr Biden actually decided to step aside and the Democrats entertained other potential candidates. One Democratic pollster close to the Biden campaign acknowledged that Ms Harris may have more potential to expand the party\u2019s voter base than the president, but was sceptical about how much of a difference she would make. Surveys pitting her against Trump at this stage \u201cdon\u2019t mean anything\u201d, said the person, who requested anonymity because they were not authorised to speak to the media.\n\nGetty Images Kamala Harris debated Trump's former VP Mike Pence during the 2020 presidential election after Joe Biden made her his running mate\n\nMs Harris, the child of an Indian mother and Jamaican father, performs better in surveys than Mr Biden with black, Latino and young voters - critical constituencies that allies say she could energise as the nominee. But whether she would actually boost turnout among younger voters of colour is another uncertain question. \u201cThis is just a wait and see moment,\u201d the pollster said. Some in the party are also asking whether Ms Harris\u2019 progressive reputation risks losing the union and blue-collar voters in the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin that Mr Biden narrowly won in 2020 and which both parties need to secure a win in November. Should she take over the ticket, some Democrats have suggested that Governor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania or Governor Roy Cooper of North Carolina could be picked as running mate to capture centrist voters in Midwestern states. Given the ages of Joe Biden and Donald Trump, voters are paying far more attention to the VP candidate of both parties in this election cycle, said Celinda Lake, a veteran Democratic pollster who worked for the 2020 Biden campaign. On the Republican side, Trump has yet to announce his running mate, although many speculate he\u2019ll pick North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum or Ohio Senator JD Vance. Deep concerns among some Democrats about Harris's strength as a presidential candidate date back to her unsuccesful 2020 bid for the party's nomination, in which she landed blows on Mr Biden in an early debate but then crashed out before the first caucuses in Iowa. Critics said she struggled to define herself as a candidate, a sentiment that has lingered throughout her tenure as vice-president. She had a shaky start in the White House, marked by high-profile interview slip-ups, low approval ratings and staff turnover. She was also tasked with overseeing the administration\u2019s strategy to reduce migration over the US southern border, which increased to record levels over the last three years and remains a major vulnerability for the campaign. Those early stumbles led Ms Harris to be more cautious about her public appearances but many voters perceive her as ineffective and absent. \u201cPeople need to know more about her, what economic issues she is strong on and they need to be reminded of the role she\u2019s played,\u201d Ms Lake said. Over the last year, Ms Harris has found stable footing as the administration\u2019s leading voice on abortion rights, an issue that proved successful for Democrats during the 2022 midterm elections and one the party hopes will win back more voters in November. As a former prosecutor who handled sexual violence cases, she has invoked personal stories of working with women who miscarried in the bathroom or were turned away at hospitals as she\u2019s tried to mobilise voters around the issue. On the campaign trail, she has also sought to capitalise on other issues that resonate with young voters, including student debt forgiveness, climate change and gun violence. The White House, too, has made a concerted effort to promote her more forcefully. Still, she faces an uphill battle to change longstanding voter scepticism - her approval ratings hover around 37% in polling averages compiled by FiveThirtyEight - a level similar to both Mr Biden and Trump. And unless Mr Biden himself caves to the mounting party pressure to step down, grassroots Democratic supporters themselves seem resigned to supporting the current ticket.\n\nAt the Essence festival in New Orleans, Iam Christian Tucker, a 41-year-old small business owner from New Orleans, said she didn\u2019t care, ultimately, who the nominee was. She said she liked Kamala Harris, but she wasn\u2019t sure if a black female president could win election. \u201cI\u2019m voting against Donald Trump more than anything,\u201d she told the BBC. Greg Hovel, 67, who attended a rally for President Biden in Madison, Wisconsin, last week, said he supported Ms Harris in the 2020 primary and \u201chas always been a fan,\u201d though he cautioned there is \u201ca lot of anti-woman sentiment in this country.\u201d \u201cI think she would make an excellent president,\u201d Mr Hovel said. \u201cBut I still think Biden can win.\u201d Mike Wendling contributed to this report from Madison, Wisconsin.

        "text": "Doris Kearns Goodwin on what history may tell Joe Biden\nBy now, you know where things stand: President Biden says he's all-in. And no one \u2013 well, almost no one \u2013 can convince him otherwise. Asked by George Stephanopoulos of ABC News last Friday whether, if he were convinced he could not defeat Donald Trump, he would stand down, Mr. Biden replied, \"Well, it depends \u2013 if the Lord Almighty comes out and tells me that, I might do that!\"\n\nOn Friday he told a cheering crowd in Madison, Wisconsin, \"Let me say this as clearly as I can: I'm staying in the race.\"\n\nPresident Biden's decision comes as some Democrats are urging the 81-year-old to get out following last month's debate.\n\nBut beyond the headlines of hand-wringing in Washington, this moment also has the whiff of history. Two past presidents offer Mr. Biden a playbook of sorts of how to handle tough questions about age, stamina, and politics in a reelection campaign. \"I think history gives us two ways of thinking about this extraordinary moment,\" said Doris Kearns Goodwin.\n\nIn 1944, she notes, Franklin D. Roosevelt, facing concerns about his health, was determined to stay in the race for a fourth term as World War II raged. \"He decided that he had to stay in the race for the good of the country, because he felt that in a certain sense that he was like a soldier who could not give up his post if the country decided they wanted him to run,\" Goodwin said.\n\nFDR made an effort to show the country he had energy, though it wasn't always easy. \"He looked much older than he actually was,\" Goodwin said. \"He was only 62 years old. The presidency ages everybody. But he knew what he was facing, and he made the decision that somehow, even with that ill health, that he was the one who was best-equipped, and he barrelled through. So, he made a decision that he was going to go out among the people.\"\n\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt and Eleanor Roosevelt wave to the crowd as they wind up their Presidential campaign tour in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., November 6, 1944. FDR was elected to a fourth term as president.

Johnson made the decision to withdraw as pressure mounted, announcing on March 31, after the New Hampshire primary, that he would not seek nor accept his party's nomination for president. \"He decided, for the good of the country, that he was in such difficulty, that he wanted to bring peace in Vietnam. Thunderstruck was the country by that decision,\" Goodwin said. \"But it was for the good of the country, he believed, and there was an extraordinary reaction to it. He said he was happier than he'd been in his entire presidency.\"\n\nAs with FDR and LBJ, Biden's challenge, she said, is showing the American people he's up to it, not just with a single interview, but by showing command of what is, perhaps, the hardest job in the world.\n\n\"President Biden has a right to be proud of, is that he has a character that has humility,\" Goodwin said. \"He's had resilience. He has empathy toward other people, toward parts of the country, toward people in trouble, and he's had accountability and responsibility. So, I think, keeping that idea that what he wants most of all is for that character to be remaining and be part of his legacy will factor into how he decides this thing. Only he can really decide that. It's a really hard decision he's going to have to make in these days and weeks ahead.\"\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\n\n\nStory produced by Jon Carras.

        "text": "Russia is starting to try to influence US presidential race, intelligence official says\nRussia has begun attempting to influence the outcome of the 2024 U.S. presidential election, a U.S. intelligence official said on Tuesday, with Moscow\u2019s preferred candidate seemingly being former President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cWe are beginning to see Russia target specific voter demographics, promote divisive narratives and denigrate specific politicians,\u201d an official from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told reporters during a press call.\n\n\u201cWe have not observed a shift in Russia\u2019s preferences for the presidential race from past elections, given the role the U.S. is playing with regard to Ukraine and broader policy toward Russia,\u201d the official later added.\n\nThe clandestine community eventually concluded that the Kremlin\u2019s efforts to sway the 2016 and 2020 presidential races were undertaken to tilt the contest in favor of Trump.\n\nA second ODNI official told reporters \u201cwe have conducted outreach with the presidential campaigns and with the candidates.\u201d\n\nThe first ODNI official said Moscow is \u201dusing a variety of approaches to bolster its messaging and lend an air of authenticity to its efforts,\u201d including outsourcing work to commercial firms to conceal its involvement. Influence actors are also planning to covertly use social media to amplify narratives in American swing states to diminish U.S. support for Ukraine.\n\nIn one instance, officials observed a Russian influence organization try to appeal to U.S. audiences through encrypted direct messaging channels \u2014 though the official did not specify which ones.\n\nThe assessment comes the same day as two other election security-related efforts by the federal government.\n\nIn a statement, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said Iranian actors are penetrating pro-Gaza protests in the U.S.\n\n\u201cWe have observed actors tied to Iran\u2019s government posing as activists online, seeking to encourage protests, and even providing financial support to protesters,\u201d according to Haines, who was pressed on the issue when she testified before the Senate in May.\n\nAmericans being targeted by Tehran\u2019s campaign \u201cmay not be aware that they are interacting with or receiving support from a foreign government,\u201d she noted. \u201cWe urge all Americans to remain vigilant as they engage online with accounts and actors they do not personally know.\u201d\n\nIn addition, U.S. and international authorities seized a Russian artificial intelligence bot farm that spewed disinformation.\n\nSpeaking on the Tuesday call with the ODNI official, an FBI official described the action as \u201celection adjacent,\u201d noting one of the examples given by law enforcement was one of the bots commenting on a candidate\u2019s post. Rather, much of the activity was \u201cfocused on Ukraine discussions and trying to produce a favorable outcome with respect to that for the Russian government.\u201d\n\nThe ODNI official said Moscow\u2019s approach to U.S. elections has become \u201cmore sophisticated\u201d after the 2016 and 2020 cycles, including understanding that \u201ctargeting swing state voters is particularly valuable to them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat doesn't mean to say that they're perfect or fully successful,\u201d the official told reporters, adding the spy community doesn\u2019t track the actual effectiveness of foreign influence campaigns.\n\n\u201cIt's more to just say that they recognize the limitations of their own approach.\u201d\n\nThe other two in the \u2018Big Three\u2019\n\nWhile Russia has started making moves against Election Day, China likely does not plan to influence the presidential race \u201cfor now\u201d because \u201cit sees little gain in choosing between two parties that it perceives as both seeking to contain Beijing,\u201d the ODNI official said.\n\nStill, Chinese officials will follow whether either major political party changes its platform or makes a particular statement that China believes is \u201csignificant enough to risk the potential blowback that they may face if they were to influence or seek to influence the election.\u201d\n\nU.S. officials are also watching if China might seek to influence select down ballot races, as it did in the 2022 midterm elections, ranging from the federal and state level all the way, potentially, to local contests, the ODNI official said.\n\nIn addition, Beijing is looking to expand its ability to collect and monitor data on all major U.S social media platforms \u201cprobably to better understand and eventually manipulate public opinion.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the official labeled Iran a \u201cchaos agent\u201d \u2014 a moniker used by another intelligence official last month.\n\nThe clandestine community will provide additional election security updates heading into November, including the 100-day mark later this month, as well as at 60 and 30 days out from Election Day.\n\nSenate Intelligence Committee Chair Mark Warner (D-VA), who has been critical of the spy community\u2019s public outreach efforts on election security, praised today\u2019s briefing.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that these updates \u2013 in addition to efforts by civil society and the private sector \u2013 will serve to better inform and prepare the public,\u201d he said in a statement.",

        "text": "2024 French election results no big win for far-right, but next steps unclear. Here's what could happen.\nParis \u2014 Election results show French voters have chosen to give a broad leftist coalition the most parliamentary seats in pivotal legislative elections, keeping the far right away from power. Yet no party won an outright majority, putting France in an uncertain, unprecedented situation.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron's centrist alliance arrived in second position. The far-right, led by Marine Le Pen's National Rally party, came in third \u2014 still drastically increasing the number of seats it holds in the National Assembly, France's lower house of parliament.\n\nSupporters of the left gathered in central Paris Sunday night to heave a collective sigh of relief as exit polls showed the French far-right's dream of taking power had been dashed. As CBS News correspondent Elaine Cobbe reported, masked protestors clashed with police on the sidelines of the rally.\n\nWith the results split, no clear figure had emerged by Monday as a possible future prime minister.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron casts his ballot flanked by French First Lady Brigitte Macron at a polling station, to vote in the second round of French parliamentary elections in Le Touquet-Paris-Plage, France, July 7, 2024. MOHAMMED BADRA/POOL\n\nMacron says he will wait to decide his next steps, and he heads to Washington this week for a NATO summit. The new legislators can start work in parliament on Monday, and their first new session starts July 18.\n\nPrime minister offers resignation, Macron asks him to stick around\n\nPrime Minister Gabriel Attal offered his resignation on Monday but Macron instead asked him to remain \"temporarily\" as head of the government after the chaotic election results left the government in limbo. Attal has said he is ready to remain in the post during the upcoming Paris Olympics and for as long as needed.\n\nAttal's government will handle current affairs pending further political negotiations.\n\nMacron's office says he will \"wait for the new National Assembly to organize itself\" before making any decisions on the new government.\n\nThere is no firm timeline for when Macron must name a prime minister, and no firm rule that he has to pick someone from the largest party in parliament.\n\nThe president's term runs until 2027, and Macron has said he will not step down before its end.\n\nMacron is a weakened president, but he's still the president\n\nWith no majority and little possibility of implementing his own plans, Macron comes out weakened from the elections.\n\nIn line with France's Constitution, he still holds some powers over foreign policy, European affairs and defense and is in charge of negotiating and ratifying international treaties. The president is also the commander-in-chief of the country's armed forces and holds the nuclear codes.\n\nThere's a possibility the new prime minister would be unable or unwilling to seriously challenge Macron's defense and foreign policy powers and would focus instead on domestic politics.\n\nThe prime minister is accountable to parliament, leads the government and introduces bills.\n\nFrench election results to force compromise and consensus\n\nThree major political blocs emerged from the elections \u2014 yet none of them is close to the majority of at least 289 seats out of 577 required to form a government on its own. The National Assembly is the most important of France's two houses of parliament. It has the final say in the law-making process over the Senate, which is dominated by conservatives.\n\nWhile not uncommon in other European countries, modern France has never experienced a parliament with no dominant party. Such a situation requires lawmakers to build consensus across parties to agree on government positions and legislation.\n\nFrance's fractious politics and deep divisions over taxes, immigration and Mideast policy make that especially challenging.\n\nThis means Macron's centrist allies won't be able to implement their pro-business policies, including a promise to overhaul unemployment benefits. It could also make passing a budget more difficult.\n\nA coalition government? A government of experts?\n\nMacron may seek a deal with the moderate left to create a joint government. Such negotiations, if they happen, are expected to be very difficult because France has no tradition of this kind of arrangement.\n\nThe deal could take the form of a loose, informal alliance \u2014 which would likely be fragile.\n\nMacron has said he would not work with the hard-left France Unbowed party, but he could possibly stretch out a hand to the Socialists and the Greens. They may refuse to take it, however.\n\nHis government last week suspended a decree that would have diminished workers' rights to unemployment benefits, which has been interpretated as a gesture toward the left.\n\nIf he can't make a political deal, Macron could name a government of experts unaffiliated with political parties. Such a government would likely deal mostly with day-to-day affairs of keeping France running.\n\nComplicating matters: Any of those options would require parliamentary approval.\n\nThe left has been torn by divisions in the past months, especially after the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas on Israel.\n\nFrance Unbowed has been sharply criticized by other more moderate leftists for its stance on the conflict. Hard-left leaders have staunchly condemned the conduct of Israel's war with Hamas and accused it of pursuing genocide against Palestinians. They have faced accusations of antisemitism, which they strongly deny.\n\nThe Socialists ran independently for the European Union elections last month, winning about 14% of the votes, when France Unbowed got less than 10% and the Greens 5.5%.\n\nYet Macron's move to call snap legislative elections pushed leftist leaders to quickly agree on forming a new coalition, the New Popular Front.\n\nTheir joint platform promises to raise the minimum salary from 1,400 to 1,600 euros ($1,515 to $1,735), to pull back Macron's pension reform that increased the retirement age from 62 to 64 and to freeze prices of essential food products and energy. All that has financial markets worried.",

Meanwhile, the laser-focus on Biden\u2019s fitness has created a perception of chaos and uncertainty in Washington that Moscow and Beijing could not be happier about.\n\nThe World This Week A weekly digest of the latest from CFR on the biggest foreign policy stories of the week, featuring briefs, opinions, and explainers.

The U.S. presidential election is not just a domestic affair. Biden\u2019s decision will have major consequences for U.S. foreign policy and global security.\n\nIf Biden leaves the race, it will inevitably raise questions about whether he is fit to serve the remainder of his term. Dropping out would render him a lame duck at home and on the international stage. It could also embolden adversaries to test the strength of America\u2019s resolve. That could mean another round of Iranian-backed Houthi rebel attacks on global shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden; a Russian escalation in Ukraine; an expanding threat from North Korea\u2019s nuclear arsenal and its arms trade with Russia; or Chinese provocations towards Taiwan or the Philippines. A U.S. president perceived as unable to do his job leaves the West without a steersman in dangerous times.\n\nIf Biden drops out, it will set off a messy succession process in the Democratic Party. The United States will be more consumed by party politics than if the race remains between Biden and Donald Trump. There has never been a case of a presumptive nominee dropping out so late in the game, and if Washington policymakers are consumed by a succession race, they won\u2019t have bandwidth to address international crises that may erupt in the run-up to November.\n\nAmong U.S. treaty allies in NATO, Japan, and South Korea, Biden\u2019s leaving the race would raise anxiety to entirely new levels. Biden has been a stable, reliable U.S. partner after the chaotic, unpredictable Trump presidency. Many allies have pinned their hopes on Biden\u2019s mantle of continuity with post-Cold War American foreign policy\u2014better the elderly president you know than the younger candidate you don\u2019t. In a world of increasing disorder, instability in the United States is not what allies want. But it is exactly what adversaries hope for.\n\nThere is a possibility, of course, that a younger, more forceful Democratic Party candidate could revive an image of strength and vitality, perhaps even turn the election around for the Democrats and burnish the U.S. image abroad as Barack Obama did in 2008, reassuring allies tired of George W. Bush\u2019s \u201cwith us or against us\u201d American unilateralism. John F. Kennedy, too, was young and relatively inexperienced, yet he arguably handled the Cuban Missile Crisis better than some of his more seasoned advisors might have.\n\nA compelling new Democratic candidate could also strengthen the image of American democracy worldwide. Selecting a new nominee would demonstrate that one of the oldest democracies in the world is a transparent system in which elites are responsive to the concerns of the population and an elected leader can be challenged publicly and by his party, unlike autocrats Vladimir Putin or Xi Jinping. It is this principle of accountability that continues to make the democracy of the United States an attractive model around the world, despite its current polarization.\n\nBut everything would have to come together perfectly to make the best-case scenario possible: a dignified withdrawal of Biden, an orderly succession to another candidate who would be a strong and powerful Democratic Party challenger to Trump.\n\nIn reality, the likelihood of chaos and instability is probably higher at this late point in the race. For U.S. foreign policy and global security, the risk of Biden dropping out might outweigh the rewards\u2014as long as American friends and foes are convinced that he can still perform the toughest job in the world.",

The Reform UK leader was elected as MP for Clacton, one of five seats his party secured at the 2024 general election. Mr Farage spoke at several rallies during Mr Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, but has told the BBC this time \u201cit\u2019ll be a couple of flying visits\u201d. \u201cI passionately believe that Trump is the right person to be the next president,\u201d Mr Farage said.\n\nStuart Woodward/BBC Nigel Farage was elected to the House of Commons on his eighth attempt\n\nTrump \u2018a peace-maker\u2019\n\nWars in Ukraine and the Middle East meant \u201cthe world is more dangerous now\u201d, Mr Farage said. He added: \u201cAmerica leads the Western world and therefore who becomes the next president matters to all of us. \u201cI think peace comes through strength, not through weakness. \u201c[Mr Trump] is, by instinct, a peace-maker, so I do believe his election and the future of NATO is absolutely vital.\u201d\n\nWhile on a visit to Jaywick, Mr Farage told the BBC it was \u201ca fair criticism\u201d that his time would be divided between local constituency issues and his national priorities. He said, however, he had already met with Tendring District Council leaders and had \u201ca base of local people working on the ground\u201d who he \u201ccan\u2019t do [the job] without\u201d. \u201cMost MPs have six or eight weeks of holiday a year - I\u2019ll have hardly any,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll be lucky to get 10 days holiday in my next year. I work incredibly hard at whatever I do.\u201d Mr Farage also told the BBC how he \u201chadn\u2019t had time yet\u201d for house-hunting in Clacton since being elected, but had put \u201ca couple of feelers out\u201d. Mr Trump congratulated Mr Farage on social media following his election to Parliament.\n\nFollow Essex news on Facebook, Instagram and X. Got a story?

        "text": "George Clooney calls for Joe Biden to quit presidential race\nTop Democratic fundraiser Clooney calls on Biden to drop out\n\nGetty Images Clooney said the Democrats will not win in November with Mr Biden\n\nGeorge Clooney has issued a damning call for Joe Biden to quit the US presidential race, hours after senior Democrat Nancy Pelosi swerved questions about whether he should continue. The actor and prominent Democratic fundraiser said the president had won many battles in his career, \"but the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time\". Another Hollywood star and fundraiser, Michael Douglas, later told the BBC he was \"worried\" about Mr Biden's electoral chances. The president has stated, repeatedly, that he is determined to remain as the Democratic party's candidate and beat Donald Trump, 78, in November. The celebrities' comments came after Mrs Pelosi, the former House Speaker, joined growing disquiet in the party, saying time was \"running short\" for Mr Biden, 81, to decide whether to stay in the race after his stumbling debate against Trump. Clooney wrote in the New York Times that it was \"devastating to say it\", but the Joe Biden he met at a fundraising event three weeks ago was not the Biden of 2010. \"He wasn\u2019t even the Joe Biden of 2020,\" added the actor. \"He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate,\" Clooney said. The fundraising event, co-hosted by Clooney in Los Angeles and also featuring Julia Roberts and Barbra Streisand, brought in a single-night record of roughly $30m (\u00a323m) for the Biden campaign. The Biden camp has hit back at the Hollywood star, with an unnamed source telling US media: \u201cThe President stayed for over 3 hours [at the fundraiser], while Clooney took a photo quickly and left.\u201d The president's campaign also pointed out that when he attended the fundraiser he had just arrived in Los Angeles from Italy, where he had been at the G7 summit.\n\nIn his op-ed, Clooney wrote: \"Our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn\u2019t see what we just saw.\" \"This is about age. Nothing more,\" he continued. \"We are not going to win in November with this president.\" Clooney added that his concerns matched those of \"every\" member of Congress with whom he had spoken. In his own comments, Michael Douglas said he had concerns about Mr Biden's capabilities during a potential second term: \"I am worried not this week or next week, but let's say next year.\" The actor said he had held a fundraiser in April for Mr Biden, who he believed had done an \"incredible job\". But, citing the debate with Trump, he said it was important for a candidate to be \"articulate\" during such a \"combative\" political era. Asked to respond to Clooney, Mr Biden's campaign referred to a letter the president sent Democrats in Congress that said he was \"firmly committed\" to his candidacy and beating Trump. Yet public dissent continues to grow within Mr Biden's party as he faces scrutiny while hosting the Nato summit in Washington.\n\nNancy Pelosi says it's the president's decision to continue\n\nMrs Pelosi, a highly influential voice among Capitol Hill Democrats, on Wednesday appeared to disregard Mr Biden's insistence that he was determined to forge on. When asked if he should stay in the election race, she told MSNBC's Morning Joe: \"I want him to do whatever he decides to do. \"It's up to the president to decide if he's going to run. We are all encouraging him to make that decision, because time is running short.\" Acknowledging the demands on the president during the Nato summit, Mrs Pelosi told MSNBC: \"I said to everyone - let's just hold off. \"Whatever you're thinking, either tell somebody privately, but you don't have to put that out on the table until we see how we go this week. But I am very proud of the president.\" Around a dozen elected Democrats have suggested he abandon his campaign since his 27 June debate with Trump. On Tuesday night, Michael Bennet of Colorado became the first Democratic senator to publicly dissent. Although he did not call for Mr Biden to quit outright, he said Trump would win the election, possibly by a \"landslide\". On Wednesday afternoon, Peter Welch of Vermont became the first Senate Democrat to openly call on Mr Biden to withdraw, \"for the good of the country\", as he wrote in a Washington Post op-ed. He was joined by the eighth and ninth congressional Democrats to make similar calls: Pat Ryan from New York and Earl Blumenauer from Oregon. The Biden campaign repeated the president's statement that he was \"running this race to the end\". Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries plans to speak to Mr Biden by Friday to discuss the concerns brought by several congressional party members. Overall support from elected Democrats remains robust, however. Gavin Newsom, the California governor who was named by Clooney as a potential replacement, said he was still \u201call in\u201d with Mr Biden. The Congressional Black Caucus, a group of roughly 60 politicians, and progressive House members like Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, have publicly backed Mr Biden. On Tuesday, Chuck Schumer, the leading Democrat in the Senate, said: \"I'm with Joe.\" Axios, however, reports that Mr Schumer has been privately telling donors he is open to dumping Mr Biden. Two unnamed senior Democrats, speaking to CBS News, the BBC's US partner, said there had been a \"convergence\" of opinion over the last 24 hours between elected Democrats, donors and groups that support the president's party. One of the sources said all of the interests have reached \u201ca near consensus\u201d about what Mr Biden should do. Questions about the Democrat's campaign were also swirling at the Nato summit in Washington DC.\n\nBiden ignores questions from reporters during meeting with Starmer",

        "text": "Explainer: Venezuela's 2024 Presidential Elections\nThe big question for Venezuela\u2019s July 28 elections may not be who voters prefer but whether their preference will be respected.\n\nThe previous presidential election, which took place in 2018, was marked by irregularities. The reelection of Nic\u00f3las Maduro was considered illegitimate by the EU and countries around the world. Now, Maduro is seeking to extend his already decade-long reign with another six-year term. But will this race be free and fair?\n\nThe fact that Venezuelans will even have the chance to go to the polls was not a given just a few months ago. The framework for this election was established in through the Barbados Accords, signed in October 2023 by the Maduro government and an alliance of opposition parties known as the Unitary Platform. The agreement set out conditions for the election, including that it must take place in the second half of this year, electoral reforms must be made, and international observation must be allowed. It also covered guarantees for the opposition\u2019s participation and primary election process. The United States, which was not party to the accords, agreed to drop some sanctions to get Maduro to stick to his Barbados pledges.\n\nA few conditions have been met. The opposition did have its primary in October 2023. And, Maduro set the date for July 28\u2014his deceased predecessor Hugo Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s birthday, marking a date that is early but within the promised range. But other promises have been violated, with one key example being the January disqualification of presidential candidate Maria Corina Machado, who won the opposition primary with 93 percent of the vote. This prompted international outcry and the resumption of some sanctions.\n\nNow, the Unitary Platform has a new candidate, former diplomat Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia, and polls suggest he has a commanding lead of as much as 50 points over Maduro. What is Gonz\u00e1lez proposing? And how might Maduro undercut his rivals?\n\nAS/COA Online covers the electoral context and the candidates.",

        "text": "US presidential election aftermath\nALLIES and supporters of the United States who praise it as the champion of democracy, freedom and human rights will now be rushing to join the media queue to congratulate the incoming president.\n\nIn their public messaging, they are likely to extol the outcome as yet another example of American exceptionalism and a role model for the countries of the world they regard as autocratic and necessary to bring down to uphold their definition of democracy and the Western rule of law.\n\nPrivately though, they will be feeling and reacting differently. They are also likely to be afraid of what will now follow.\n\nThe explanation is not far to find. Though portrayed in Western media as offering vastly different visions of the US for the next four years as well as being diametrically opposed in their foreign policy objectives, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump concur in adherence to the slogan made famous by Trump: that is to \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d (Maga).\n\nIt is a slogan that Democrat party leaders embrace just as strongly but would rather not\n\nlet the rest of the world be aware of or knowledgeable about.\n\nHow will Maga impact US foreign policy?\n\nPost-election, the Maga agenda will be pushed hard and at the expense of the interests and concerns of the rest of the world. Maga foreign policy impact will be felt not only by countries that the US sees as rivals and enemies \u2013 China, Russia, North Korea, Iran, Cuba, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Serbia, Venezuela, Belarus and others.\n\nIt will also inflict costs on allies including Canada, European Union nations, Ukraine, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, and a few others such as the Philippines, previously provided with generous financial and military support by a moneyed and powerful benefactor, which is now relatively impoverished and less influential.\n\nCountries not hitched to the American ideological bandwagon that see themselves as independent such as Mexico, India and Vietnam will find that sitting on the fence in the next four years will be much less comfortable as the new US president will not shield or spare them from the looming policy changes in trade, immigration, security, climate change and wherever else he or she sees as important and necessary to uplift the US and stem its decline.\n\nEarlier in July, The Economist drew up a table ranking the vulnerability of various countries likely to be impacted by a new Trump presidency\u2019s core policies. The table, The Trump Risk Index, assessed the exposure and vulnerability of America\u2019s 70 largest trading partners to potential policy changes.\n\nAlthough no similar table was drawn up for a Harris presidency, if one were to be drawn up, it is likely that there will be little or no difference in the index finding and ranking.\n\nIncreasingly, we find that liberal and conservative American analysts \u2013 both now recognising that the US is in an existential crisis \u2013 are converging in support of Maga to be the focus of US foreign policy.\n\nThe crisis, a long-developing one, exposes not only the deep divisions within American society with equal numbers on Republican and Democrat sides of the political fence in disagreement on the domestic policy reforms that the country badly needs.\n\nIt also brings to attention the current status of the US described by Trump as \u201ca failing country\u201d. It is a description that some Americans have taken umbrage with but which many Democrat supporters agree on while denouncing the Republican and Trumpian rhetoric and record on failing to improve the state of the nation.\n\nWhat is perhaps most unsettling is that the disorder and instability in the US may see the new president become more reliant on US military superiority to ensure American dominance in global geopolitics.\n\nThe US military may again be called upon to underpin the foreign policy actions needed to make America great again.\n\nIs a last hurrah coming to ensure that the US continues its defence of the unipolar world that it has shaped and is fixated on preserving?\n\nLim Teck Ghee\u2019s Another Take is aimed at demystifying social orthodoxy.\n\nComments: letters@thesundaily.com",

Each convention is held in a location decided by the respective party\u2019s national convention committee which is responsible for planning their nominating convention.\n\nDelegates are selected in primary or caucus contests and are chosen because of their political leadership or activism. These delegates from each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia and several U.S. Territories then go to the national convention and confirm their choice of nominees for the Office of the U.S. President and Vice President .

But the presidential transition project, as Heritage calls it, is better-known \u2014 and much more disliked \u2014 among Democrats after recent attacks from high-profile figures including President Joe Biden. Most of a dozen Project 2025 proposals included in the poll are unpopular with Americans. Overall, 20% of U.S. adult citizens say they've heard a lot about Project 2025, while 39% have heard a little and 42% have heard nothing at all. 35% of Democrats say they've heard a lot about the project, compared to 7% of Republicans.\n\nNot only have few Americans heard much about Project 2025, but few have an opinion about it. 48% don't know whether they have a favorable or unfavorable opinion, while 13% have a very or somewhat favorable opinion, and 39% have an unfavorable opinion. That's driven by Democrats, among whom 8% have a favorable opinion and 64% have an unfavorable opinion. Most Independents with an opinion about Project 2025 dislike it (7% favorable, 38% unfavorable), while Republicans are more positive (26% favorable, 12% unfavorable).\n\nDemocrats (30%) are much more likely than Republicans (8%) to have seen a lot of news coverage in the past week about Project 2025. That's a bigger partisan gap than any of the nine other news stories YouGov asked Americans about. Majorities of Democrats and Republicans had seen a lot of coverage about whether Biden would withdraw from the presidential race.\n\nYouGov asked Americans about nine different proposals contained in the Project 2025 document, without mentioning in the question that the proposals are from the project. None have support from more than 50% of Americans, though two of the nine have more support than opposition: Sending U.S. troops to help make arrests along the U.S.-Mexico border, and returning the U.S. to a gold-backed currency. A third, outlawing pornography, has equal shares of support and opposition. The other six proposals have more opposition than support.\n\nAll nine proposals have more support from Republicans than Democrats. Seven have support from a majority of Republicans, while none have support from more than one-third of Democrats.",

        "text": "How America's allies are trying to 'Trump-proof' Nato's future\nUS allies try to 'Trump-proof' Nato - but is that even possible?\n\nAFP Donald Trump at a Nato summit in Brussels in 2018\n\nOnly one US president has been at the Nato summit in Washington this week, but the shadow of another - his predecessor - has loomed over this meeting of the world's most powerful military alliance. While the host Joe Biden has presided over a message of unity from the group's 32 members, the Nato-sceptic views of his rival for power, Donald Trump, have imbued conversations here with an urgency and an anxiety. At times the smiles from world leaders in the conference hall have felt fragile. Trump \u201changs over every conversation here\", said one Eastern European diplomat who asked to remain nameless. The Republican's election as president in November \"could change everything\u201d, the diplomat said. The fact that Mr Biden has been trying to fend off a political crisis over his frailty has only sharpened the sense that a second Trump term could bring far-reaching changes to an alliance forged in the ashes of the World War Two and still reliant on hard US military power to deter adversaries.\n\nSo does Nato need to \u201cTrump-proof\u201d itself - as some describe it - and if so, is it possible? There is a lot of evidence of efforts by Nato allies to reach out already to those in Trump\u2019s political orbit to try to manage relationships and limit what they would see as the potential damage of a second term. But others suggest something more unmanageable. Camille Grand, a French former official who was one of Nato\u2019s deputy leaders throughout the Trump administration, described himself as \u201cmuch more worried\u201d than colleagues who think a second term may be \u201cTrump [term] one on steroids\u201d but ultimately workable for the alliance. \u201cHe doesn't have the same sort of guardrails, he doesn't have the same sort of adults in the room. And he has around him a team that is trying to turn his instinct into policy,\u201d said Mr Grand, who is now a fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. Four members of visiting delegations, who asked to remain anonymous, told the BBC their concern was not necessarily that a Trump administration would withdraw entirely from Nato, as he has threatened before. What is Nato and which countries are members? Rather it is a fear that the US commitment to the alliance's core principle of collective security - \"all for one and one for all\", meaning any ally under attack can expect defence from the others - could wane. Trump\u2019s positions on Nato have veered erratically from outright hostility - portraying the alliance as a bunch of freeloading Europeans surviving off protection paid for by US taxpayers - to suggesting his outbursts are simply part of a cunning negotiating tactic to compel more of Nato\u2019s members to meet its defence spending targets. He has frequently tried to rally crowds of supporters with attacks on the organisation. As the summit began, he posted to his Truth Social network that when he started as president most Nato members were \u201cdelinquent\u201d until they \u201cpaid up\u201d due to his pressure.\n\nThe Ukraine war was the big topic at the summit\n\nBy the end of Trump\u2019s presidency, four more Nato countries had hit the alliance\u2019s guidelines of spending at least 2% of national income on defence. So far during President Biden\u2019s term, another 13 countries have reached the target. That progress is frequently touted by the Biden administration and its backers, although in reality much of the increase was triggered by Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. At a February campaign rally in South Carolina, Trump said he would let Russia \u201cdo whatever the hell they want\u201d to Nato countries that did not spend enough. That sparked outrage from some quarters in Washington, but privately his threats are said to have gone further. At a panel event in January, European Union commissioner Thierry Breton described a meeting he had attended in 2020 between Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. \u201cDonald Trump said to Ursula: \u2018You need to understand that if Europe is under attack, we will never come to help you and to support you. And by the way, Nato is dead. And we will leave, we will quit Nato.\u2019 \"It was the president of the United States of America,\u201d recalled Mr Breton. \u201cHe may come back.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign has been approached by the BBC with a request to confirm whether the account was accurate. Evelyn Farkas, a former senior official at the Pentagon in the Obama administration, believes there remains a real concern even over Nato\u2019s existence under Mr Trump. \u201cI think there is a danger with Trump that he tries to pull us out of Nato. I won't sugarcoat that,\u201d said Dr Farkas, now executive director at public policy think tank the McCain Institute. \u201cThe reality is Trump is dangerous to the alliance in that America is still the strongest economic, political, military power and Nato is stronger if Nato has the United States inside the alliance.\" But one of those familiar with the thinking in Trump\u2019s political orbit, Dan Caldwell from the right-wing think tank Defence Priorities, believes the former president's priority is to push European nations to invest more in their own militaries. \u201cI don't think he wants to withdraw from Nato, but he has said that the United States should re-evaluate its role and the purpose of Nato going forward,\u201d he said. \u201cNot only the former president but more and more national security experts on the right believe the United States has really no choice but to do less in Europe. So I think that there's some larger forces at play, that will eventually force the next president, regardless of who it is\u2026 to substantially pull back from Nato.\" The most detailed account of policy positions that might influence a second Trump term comes from an initiative being brought up by supporters and detractors of Trump alike. Overseen by the conservative Heritage Foundation, \u201cProject 2025\u201d is a 900-page detailed blueprint for a Republican president to usher in a sweeping overhaul of the executive branch.\n\nGetty Images Trump sees China as the greatest threat to US\n\nThe initiative says a future president should \u201ctransform Nato\u201d so that America\u2019s role is primarily for its nuclear deterrent, while other members should field \u201cthe great majority\u201d of conventional forces required to deter Russia. This is in keeping with the project\u2019s foreign policy position, seeing the main threat to US primacy as China and therefore calling for the next president to \u201cbring resolution to the foreign policy tensions\u201d sparked by Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Trump himself has equivocated over the war but has said he would end it in \u201c24 hours\u201d. He favours brokering a deal between Russia and Ukraine on terms that many Nato allies would see as surrender for Kyiv. Trump has partially disavowed Project 2025, saying he does not know who is behind it but many of his former officials had a hand in writing it, including a former acting defense secretary. Since Trump left office, the increase in the number of Nato members spending at least 2% of their income on defence has better insulated the alliance for the future, said Senator Chris Coons, a Democrat who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Asked about \"Trump-proofing\", he said Congress had also moved to shield America's membership of Nato from the whims of the White House, in a law passed last year. \u201cWe clarified no president can unilaterally withdraw from Nato without a vote of approval from the Senate,\u201d Mr Coons told the BBC.\n\nMore on the US election",

The package includes $79.1 billion in funding for ED, a $500 million decrease from FY 2023. It sustains funding for the Pell Grant program that keeps the maximum award at $7,395, and does not cut funding to the Federal Work-Study and Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant programs, as proposed by the House.\n\nEmmanual Guillory, ACE senior director of government relations, told Inside Higher Ed that while not ideal, the funding levels are pretty much what the higher education community expected.\n\n\u201cWe're happy we didn't see any more cuts, but we're advocating for the necessary increases, especially in areas where there's no accounting for inflation,\" he said. \u201cStill, we're seeing basically all level funding here. In a regulatory environment like this one, that's a win.\"\n\nAdditional highlights in the package include (compared to FY 2023):\n\nFunding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges and Universities, and Minority Serving Institutions was increased collectively by $7.5 million;\n\nThe Strengthening Institutions Program was decreased by $10 million;\n\nFunding for international education and foreign language programs is sustained;\n\nThe Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education saw an overall decrease of $13 million;\n\nFederal TRIO programs are sustained at $1.19 billion;\n\nPrograms such as Child Care Access Means Parents In School ($75 million), Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need ($23.55 million), and Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness in Undergraduate Programs ($388 million) were funded at the FY 2023 levels; and\n\nThe National Institutes of Health receives $48.6 billion (an increase of $300 million over FY 2023) and there is $1.5 million for the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, level with FY 2023 funding.\n\nEarlier this month, President Biden released his FY 2025 budget request, which would increase spending for many higher education programs. Congress has until Sept. 30 to approve FY 2025 funding.",

        "text": "Progressives look to Supreme Court to motivate voters in 2024 race\nWashington \u2014 On the heels of the Supreme Court's conclusion of its momentous term earlier this month, progressive groups are pouring millions into offensives that seek to make the nation's highest court a galvanizing issue for voters in November.\n\nThe campaigns highlight the court's recent decisions on presidential immunity, agency regulatory power and guns, as well as the prospect that if elected to a second term, former President Donald Trump could appoint new and young justices who would sit on the Supreme Court for decades to come.\n\nBy focusing on educating voters about the impact the next president will have on the high court, progressives hope to mobilize them to cast their ballots for the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, President Biden, even amid concerns from members of the party over his fitness for a second term following his poor performance in the debate against Trump last month.\n\n\"The same way people on the right have been Supreme Court voters because they were focused on the freedoms they wanted the Supreme Court to take away from us, we are motivating folks who care about preserving our freedoms to be a Supreme Court voter and to ensure Trump cannot appoint more justices to this court,\" said Christina Harvey, executive director of the progressive advocacy group Stand Up America.\n\nTwo years after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022, Stand Up America rolled out a seven-figure campaign highlighting the court and the next president's potential stamp on it. Called \"Supreme Court Voter,\" the initiative warns of the impacts the conservative majority could have on future cases involving abortion, gun laws and voting rights.\n\nUnited for Democracy, a coalition of 140 advocacy groups, launched its own $10 million campaign in May that aims to draw a line between the Supreme Court and Trump, who appointed three of its six conservative justices. Called \"Stop the Relentless Power Grab,\" the initiative is a nod to the court's decision this term in a pair of cases \u2014 one called Relentless, Inc. v. Department of Commerce \u2014 that curtailed the power of federal agencies to interpret and fill gaps in the laws passed by Congress.\n\nIn addition to that ruling, the court also invalidated a Trump-era ban on bump stock devices that attach to semi-automatic rifles, narrowed a federal obstruction law used to charge hundreds of Jan. 6 defendants and Trump, and found that a former president is immune from federal prosecution for official acts taken while in the White House. The immunity decision affects special counsel Jack Smith's case against Trump, who pleaded not guilty to four counts stemming from an alleged scheme to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 election.\n\nBut the court also rejected a challenge by anti-abortion doctors seeking to make a widely used abortion pill harder to obtain, cleared the way for Idaho physicians to perform emergency abortions in certain circumstances and upheld a federal law prohibiting alleged domestic abusers from having guns.\n\nDemocrats' criticism of the Supreme Court ramped up after the conservative majority unwound the constitutional right to abortion two years ago, an outcome made possible by Trump's three appointments to the Supreme Court. His final pick, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, took her seat on the high court days before the 2020 election following the death of the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in September 2020.\n\nBut Trump's own ascension to the White House in 2016 was fueled in part by voters who cared about Supreme Court appointments, an issue that took on added significance following the unexpected death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia that February. Of voters who said Supreme Court nominations were the most important factor when considering who to support in the 2016 race, 56% cast ballots for Trump, according to exit polls. Additionally, 26% of Trump voters said appointments were the most important factor for them.\n\nMuch as the vacancy created by Scalia's death drove conservative voters to back Trump in 2016, progressives are hoping that the prospect of open seats in the next four years drives voters to support Mr. Biden in November.\n\n\"It's no secret that progressives are far behind\" in educating voters about the court, Stasha Rhodes, United for Democracy's campaign director, said. \"But we see an opportunity over the coming months to turn this around.\"\n\nThree of the justices, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Sonia Sotomayor, are in their 70s, and Chief Justice John Roberts is 69. If Trump wins, Thomas, who is the longest serving of the current justices, and Alito could step down, allowing the Republican president to appoint successors who would be younger and therefore poised to serve for decades. Trump's three appointees, Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Barrett, are all in their 50s. It's highly unlikely either Thomas or Alito will retire if Mr. Biden is reelected in November.\n\nMr. Biden himself has warned that the next president could nominate two justices to the Supreme Court, and former President Barack Obama said during a joint fundraiser with the president last month that the current landscape is a byproduct of the 2016 election.\n\n\"We have learned our lesson because these elections matter in very concrete ways,\" Obama said. \"And we're seeing how much it matters when it comes to the Supreme Court.\"\n\nLiberal commentators have suggested Sotomayor should retire this year, with Mr. Biden still in the White House and Democrats in control of the Senate. But the idea has not gained traction with Senate Democrats.\n\nStill, Harvey indicated the coalition's efforts are aimed not only at helping Democrats hold onto the White House, but also retaining control of the Senate and flipping the House, which is now controlled by Republicans. Total control by Democrats could clear the way for Congress to enact court-reform legislation, including a bill imposing term limits on current and future justices, she said.\n\nUnder that plan, called the Supreme Court Term Act, a president would name a justice every two years, and current members would be required to assume senior status, a form of semi-retirement, in order of length of tenure as new justices are appointed. If passed by a Democrat-led Congress and signed into law by a Democratic president, the legislation would require Thomas, appointed in 1991, to step down first, followed by Roberts, tapped in 2005.\n\nUnder that scenario, control of the court would flip from a 6-3 conservative majority to 5-4 liberal majority in a matter of years.\n\n\"We want to make sure that the American people understand the power that they and their elected representatives have to check an extreme movement in the court. The Constitution of the United States provides Congress the power to fix this problem, said Skye Perryman, senior adviser to Demand Justice, a liberal judicial advocacy group. \"Sometimes that gets lost and the court seems like an untouchable entity and the die is cast and there's nothing that the American people can do, but our Constitution provides the tools for the American people to make their voices heard and to lawmakers to enact reforms.\"\n\nDemand Justice, which is one of the most vocal groups advocating for reforming the Supreme Court, plans to spend $10 million this year on efforts targeting the high court. As part of its offensive, it will be launching a $2 million campaign focused on moms that aims to educate them about the court and the ramifications of its rulings for women and families.\n\n\"This is a critical moment where people are understanding and paying attention to what is happening in the courts,\" Perryman said.\n\nSeparately, Democrats on Capitol Hill have been mounting attacks on the Supreme Court and its conservative members, specifically Thomas and Alito, over their ties to wealthy Republican benefactors.\n\nDemocratic Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse and Ron Wyden urged Attorney General Merrick Garland last week to appoint a special counsel to investigate Thomas, who has faced scrutiny over travel he accepted from GOP megadonor Harlan Crow.\n\nAnd on Wednesday, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York introduced articles of impeachment against Thomas and Alito, escalating Democrats' disapproval of the high court and its conservative members.\n\nIt's highly unlikely the GOP-led House will act on the articles, and Republican lawmakers have denounced Democrats' actions as an attempt to undermine the court's legitimacy in response to decisions on politically charged issues with which they disagree.",

This new initiative was made possible by resources from President Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act.\u00a0The IRS in 2023 launched a new initiative to pursue high-income, high-wealth individuals who have failed to pay recognized tax debt, with dozens of senior employees assigned to these cases. This campaign is concentrated among taxpayers with more than $1 million in income and more than $250,000 in recognized tax debt.\u201cPresident Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act is increasing tax fairness and ensuring that all wealthy taxpayers pay the taxes they owe, just like working families do,\u201d said U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. \u201cA new initiative to collect overdue taxes from a small group of wealthy taxpayers is already a major success, yielding more than $1 billion in revenue so far.\u201dIn an initial success, the IRS announced last year that it had collected $38 million from more than 175 high-income, high-wealth individuals. The IRS then expanded this effort last fall to 1,600 additional high-income, high-wealth individuals. The IRS has assigned more than 1,500 of these 1,600 cases to senior employees, with more than $1 billion collected to date.Prior to President Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act, more than a decade of budget cuts prevented the IRS from keeping pace with increasing complexity and ensuring that wealthy taxpayers, large corporations, and complex partnerships pay taxes owed under current law. The effort to pursue high-income, high-wealth individuals who have failed to pay past-due tax debt is one of several initiatives the IRS has launched to improve tax fairness and reduce the deficit. In the past two years, the IRS has launched:\u00a0A new initiative to crack down on abuse of corporate jets for personal travel.\u00a0A campaign to collect taxes owed by 125,000 high-income, high-wealth earners who have not filed taxes in years.\u00a0Audits of 76 of the largest partnerships with average assets of $10 billion that represent a cross section of industries including hedge funds, real estate investment partnerships, publicly traded partnerships, and large law firms.Audits of the 60 largest corporate taxpayers, with average assets of $24 billion.\u202f\u00a0And a new regulatory initiative to close a major tax loophole exploited by large, complex partnerships that could raise more than $50 billion in revenue over 10 years.\u00a0In addition to enhancing tax fairness, these initiatives will narrow the gap between taxes owed and taxes paid, reducing the deficit.\u00a0New Treasury and IRS analysis shows these investments in high-end enforcement, technology, and data resulting in $851 billion in additional revenue over the next decade if the investments in the Inflation Reduction Act are continued as President Biden has proposed.\u00a0These enforcement initiatives are consistent with Secretary Yellen\u2019s commitment to not increase audit rates relative to current levels for Americans making less than $400,000 a year.\u00a0###",

This shocking act of political violence will inevitably have an effect on the campaign. US Secret Service agents shot dead the suspect at the scene. And law enforcement sources told the BBC's US partner CBS News that they are treating the attack as an assassination attempt. The picture - of a bleeding Mr Trump, fist in the air, being escorted away- was quickly posted on social media by his son Eric Trump with the caption: \u201cThis is the fighter America needs.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden appeared on TV shortly after the shooting and said there was no place in America for political violence like this. He expressed concern for his Republican opponent and said he hoped to speak with him later tonight. Mr Biden\u2019s election campaign paused all political statements and is working to take down its television ads as quickly as possible, clearly believing that it would be inappropriate to attack Donald Trump at this time and instead concentrating on condemning what\u2019s happened. Politicians from across the political spectrum \u2013 people who agree on very little else \u2013 are coming together to say violence has no place in a democracy. Former Presidents Barack Obama, George W Bush and Bill Clinton, plus the Carter Center speaking on behalf of Jimmy Carter, were all quick to denounce the violence and said how relieved they were that Trump was not seriously hurt.\n\nWatch now on iPlayer Trump Assassination Attempt: What Happened?",

        "text": "Learn more at Marianne2024.com\nDear Friends,\n\nIn 2016, there were two candidates telling people their pain was legitimate and their rage was valid \u2013 that the system indeed had been rigged against them. They were Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump.\n\nOnly one of them, however, wanted to do something about it. The other mainly sought to harness all that anger for his own political purposes.\n\nAnd here we are.\n\nThe rage that people were feeling then is still felt today. Has the system improved economically in the last two years? In some ways, yes. But in fundamental ways, no. It\u2019s now baked into the cake that our corrupted political system is at the service of the few at the expense of the many. And it will not disrupt itself.\n\nOne in four Americans still live with medical debt. A third of America\u2019s workforce work for less than $15 an hour; half can\u2019t afford a one bedroom apartment. Half our seniors live on less than $25,000 a year. The United States has the highest poverty rate of any advanced democracy.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the top 20 per cent of American earners, the economy works well. And for that we can be grateful. But that 20 per cent live on an island that is surrounded by a sea of economic despair. Within that sea, a myriad of personal and societal dysfunctions breed easily \u2013 from chronic anxiety and addiction to ideological capture by genuinely psychotic, even fascist elements of our society.\n\nWe must respond to this situation, for it represents an unsustainable disquiet.\n\nFranklin Roosevelt said we wouldn\u2019t have to worry about a fascist takeover in America so long as democracy delivered on its promises. Yes, there is a genuine fascist threat in America today. But we can\u2019t just fight the disease; we must build up our societal immune system, as well. That means we must build up our people.\n\nWe must provide a massive infusion of economic hope and opportunity to the over 70 per cent of Americans who say they feel no economic hope, who simply do what they can to survive what they know is an inherently unjust economic system. Their dreams, and the dreams of their children, are limited. They are depressed and angry about it, and if those feelings are not assuaged \u2013 if their needs are not met \u2013 then America will be in even bigger trouble than we are now.\n\nThat is why I am running for President. I have had a forty year career working up close and personal with people whose lives are in trouble, and too many are in trouble now.\n\nOur government \u201cof the people, by the people, and for the people\u201d has become a government \u201cof the corporations, by the corporations, and for the corporations.\u201d Our public policies regularly do more to serve the goal of short-term profit maximization for corporate and billionaire donors, than to serve the goal of safety, health and well-being of the American people.\n\nThe humanitarian values at the core of our Declaration of Independence have been replaced by a soulless economics as the governing principle of our civilization. The tentacles of hyper-capitalism, devoid of any ethical or moral consideration, now reach greedily into every corner of our society. A Second Gilded Age is upon us, income disparity as great as at any time in our history, and everything from climate catastrophe to AI catastrophe to nuclear catastrophe now loom as genuine threats to our civilization.\n\nIt is time to turn around.\n\nIn the words of President John F. Kennedy, \u201cThose who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable.\u201d In the years ahead of us, America is going to change. It is up to us to make the change a conscious, wise and responsible one. As President, I will make sure we do.\n\nA corporate aristocracy \u2013 from insurance and pharmaceutical companies to Big Ag to Big Food to chemical companies to gun manufacturers to Big Oil to Big Tech to defense contractors \u2013 now tyrannize this country, and the days of their overreach and entitlement must end. No one thing is going to make that happen, but a president who is willing to use the power of the executive branch to stand up to what Roosevelt called the \u201ceconomic royalists\u201d is a good solid beginning. And I will be that.\n\nAs Americans, we need a season of repair, a new beginning, a renewed faith in what\u2019s possible. Our political imaginations can flourish once more, if we allow the better angels of our nature to emerge among us. I dedicate this campaign to the people, to the spirit in our hearts, and to the possibility of fundamental change.\n\nWith your help, we can spread this message far and wide and set America on the path of a new beginning.",

        "text": "Trump assassination attempt upends 2024 election\nTragedy at Trump rally upends election campaign - for now\n\nAP Donald Trump pumps his fist in the air, moments after an assassination attempt on him\n\nThe 2024 election campaign has a new iconic image: Donald Trump, moments after narrowly avoiding serious injury or death from an assassin\u2019s bullets, standing with his fist raised, lines of blood streaked across his face, an American flag billowing in the breeze behind him. \u201cFight! Fight! Fight!\u201d the former president said, as some of the supporters, who moments before had feared for their lives, began cheering. The bloodshed in Pennsylvania will leave a lasting mark on the American psyche, puncturing the veneer of security around the highest levels of presidential politics \u2013 of magnetic screening, bulletproof limousines and heavily armed Secret Service agents. Even former presidents are not insulated from the violence that can erupt in everyday American life. It was also a dramatic moment in American political history; one that is sure to be replayed in video clips, still photographs and testimonial accounts throughout the course of this presidential campaign and in campaigns to come. In a rare address from the Oval Office Sunday evening, President Joe Biden called on Americans to cool the temperature around political debate. \"[It] must never be a battlefield and, God forbid, a killing field,\" he warned. \"No matter how strong our convictions, we must never descend into violence.\"\n\nNo place in America for this kind of violence - Biden\n\nThe attack has already begun coursing through America's partisan dialogue, as numerous Republicans have spoken out to condemn President Biden and the Democrats for creating a rhetorical environment conducive to the violence. They point to dire warnings about the former president becoming a dictator and threatening democracy as examples of the overheated language that could inspire an assassin. In particular, they highlight leaked comments the president made in private to donors just last week about increasing the attacks on the former president\u2019s record and putting a \u201cbull\u2019s-eye\u201d on him. \u201cThey've tried to take him out in so many other ways, financially, they've tried to throw him in jail,\u201d Donald Trump Jr said in a television interview on Sunday. \u201cIt's almost as if they would love for this to happen.\u201d\n\nAt least so far, however, the motives and political affiliations of the alleged assassin, 20-year-old Pennsylvania resident Thomas Matthew Crooks, are in doubt. They may ultimately defy an easy partisan narrative. The former president\u2019s oldest son went on to add that, after the assassination attempt, those on the left can no longer accuse the former president of culpability for the 6 January attack on the US Capitol. That violent episode took place hours after the then-president had held a rally just a few dozen blocks away, challenging the 2020 election results. His actions on that day led to his impeachment by the House of Representatives and, more than a year later, indictment by a special counsel appointed by the US attorney general. If the Pennsylvania shooting defuses this line of criticism by Democrats, it\u2019s just one way in which it will have fundamentally reshaped this presidential campaign. Others may become clear over the course of the Republican National Convention, which starts on Monday in Milwaukee. The failed attack on the former president plays into several themes the Trump campaign was already planning for the quadrennial gathering, which culminates with Trump taking the stage to accept his party\u2019s nomination on Thursday night. The first is that it could provide a boost to the politics of grievance and persecution that have been a central focus of his rally speeches and social media posts. \u201cThey\u2019re not really after me; they\u2019re after you,\u201d is a common Trump refrain, on t-shirts, billboards and car stickers. \u201cI\u2019m just in the way.\u201d That message will land with new force after the former president and his crowd of supporters were sprayed with bullets. Trump\u2019s legions of fans \u2013 many of whose support borders on near-messianic hero-worship - will have all the more reason to identify with a man who almost lost his life while standing before them.\n\nGetty Images Supporters of former US President Donald Trump wait for the start of a campaign rally\n\nThe former president\u2019s brush with death, and subsequent acts of bloody defiance, will also fit with the contrast Trump campaign officials have said they are trying to draw at this week\u2019s convention \u2013 one where their candidate, and party, embody rugged masculinity and strength, while their opponents are feeble. President Biden\u2019s age and capabilities have dogged his campaign for months \u2013 and prompted a Democratic crisis of confidence in his re-election effort after a stunningly poor performance at the presidential debate just over two weeks ago. Saturday night\u2019s attack, and Trump\u2019s response to it, will allow Republicans to put that contrast in stark relief in the days ahead. Democrats have spent the past two weeks in anguished soul-searching over their president\u2019s political future. Now, they have a new set of concerns. In a way, the assassination attempt may end up providing a political lifeline to Mr Biden, given that the focus has dramatically shifted away from his age-related struggles and internal attempts to oust him. But the president\u2019s re-election strategy \u2013 which hinges on painting Trump as a danger to the nation if he again becomes president \u2013 could be seriously hampered if the American public is hostile to new, pointed criticisms of the man.\n\nWatch now on iPlayer Trump Assassination Attempt: What Happened?",

        "text": "What the election rhetoric means for international students\nUNITED STATES What the election rhetoric means for international students Tweet\n\n\n\nToday, international students make up nearly 6% of the US higher education population, numbering over 1,000,000 individuals. This raw number has not yet hit the high water mark of the 2018-19 school year, but has been increasing since 2021-22 when nation-state borders reopened and COVID-19 vaccines were more readily available worldwide.\n\n\n\nInternational students enrolled in US higher education institutions bring with them distinct perspectives, experiences and languages. Additionally, the majority of these students bring economic power through their willingness to pay full or nearly full fees for their education.\n\n\n\nIf international prospective students and their families determine that the US is not the best destination for them, it could have profound implications for the sector.\n\n\n\nHigher education institutions are already struggling in the wake of what economics professor Nathan Grawe refers to as the demographic cliff and problems with the new\n\n\n\nWhile international students are, at times, categorically different from immigrants, previous rhetoric related to bans and xenophobia have\n\n\n\nIn the lead-up to the 2024 presidential election, it is important to understand the major candidates\u2019 rhetoric regarding immigration in order to prepare and respond to policies in the international higher education sector.\n\n\n\nWhat is Trump saying?\n\n\n\nPrior to the first US presidential debate in June 2024, former president Donald Trump proposed, in an off-hand comment, a policy change that would allow all F-1 visa holders graduating from US colleges and universities to receive green cards,\n\n\n\nWhile the Trump campaign has already withdrawn this proposal, the mass implementation of green cards would have allowed F-1 visa holders not to be beholden to finite Optional Practical Training regulations, making their status in the US after graduation less fraught.\n\n\n\nIf this policy were to be implemented, there would be immense pressure on institutional and federal bodies to process green cards in a timely manner \u2013 and probably an explosion of applications to be evaluated by admissions and financial aid professionals.\n\n\n\nThis outcome would significantly bog down\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, the platform states that his administration will secure borders and reclaim national sovereignty. As in 2016, Trump suggests a solution of mass deportation and that non-US citizens are a burden for institutions.\n\n\n\nThis rhetoric does not present the US as a safe or welcoming place.\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s platform also wants to explicitly reject globalism. This section of his platform specifically calls out China as a rival. Future anti-China policy prescriptions would have detrimental effects on higher education enrolment, given that over 27% of international students in the US have China as their country of origin.\n\n\n\nExplicit anti-China and nationalistic rhetoric will have immediate negative consequences on US higher education institutions\u2019 international student matriculation.\n\n\n\nWhat is Biden saying?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is an extreme oversight and seemingly suggests that he and his administration are comfortable with the status quo and are not intent on either deterring or welcoming immigrants to the US or to higher education institutions.\n\n\n\nOn 4 June 2024\n\n\n\nWhile Biden continues to refer to the immigration system as \u201cbroken\u201d, he is most often referring to the US southern border with Mexico.

According to the 2023 Open Doors data , the number of international students enrolled in higher education institutions in the United States is rebounding from the COVID-19 dip.Today, international students make up nearly 6% of the US higher education population, numbering over 1,000,000 individuals. This raw number has not yet hit the high water mark of the 2018-19 school year, but has been increasing since 2021-22 when nation-state borders reopened and COVID-19 vaccines were more readily available worldwide.International students enrolled in US higher education institutions bring with them distinct perspectives, experiences and languages. Additionally, the majority of these students bring economic power through their willingness to pay full or nearly full fees for their education.If international prospective students and their families determine that the US is not the best destination for them, it could have profound implications for the sector.Higher education institutions are already struggling in the wake of what economics professor Nathan Grawe refers to as the demographic cliff and problems with the new Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form which have decreased completion rates by nearly 30% in 2023-24 and suggest a likely decline in domestic college-going students.While international students are, at times, categorically different from immigrants, previous rhetoric related to bans and xenophobia have negatively impacted enrolment at US higher education institutions.In the lead-up to the 2024 presidential election, it is important to understand the major candidates\u2019 rhetoric regarding immigration in order to prepare and respond to policies in the international higher education sector.Prior to the first US presidential debate in June 2024, former president Donald Trump proposed, in an off-hand comment, a policy change that would allow all F-1 visa holders graduating from US colleges and universities to receive green cards, according to the New York Times . This policy prescription would be a monumental change from Trump\u2019s previous immigration policies which focused on mass deportations.While the Trump campaign has already withdrawn this proposal, the mass implementation of green cards would have allowed F-1 visa holders not to be beholden to finite Optional Practical Training regulations, making their status in the US after graduation less fraught.If this policy were to be implemented, there would be immense pressure on institutional and federal bodies to process green cards in a timely manner \u2013 and probably an explosion of applications to be evaluated by admissions and financial aid professionals.This outcome would significantly bog down systems that are already pressed to process increasing numbers of applications year over year, but would simultaneously have positive outcomes for international students. Trump\u2019s official platforms for the 2024 election say two things related to immigration, neither of which are positively framed for international audiences.First, the platform states that his administration will secure borders and reclaim national sovereignty. As in 2016, Trump suggests a solution of mass deportation and that non-US citizens are a burden for institutions.This rhetoric does not present the US as a safe or welcoming place.Trump\u2019s platform also wants to explicitly reject globalism. This section of his platform specifically calls out China as a rival. Future anti-China policy prescriptions would have detrimental effects on higher education enrolment, given that over 27% of international students in the US have China as their country of origin.Explicit anti-China and nationalistic rhetoric will have immediate negative consequences on US higher education institutions\u2019 international student matriculation. President Joe Biden\u2019s platforms do not explicitly include immigration. Nor does his official site mention any immigration-related accomplishments during these nearly four years of his presidency.This is an extreme oversight and seemingly suggests that he and his administration are comfortable with the status quo and are not intent on either deterring or welcoming immigrants to the US or to higher education institutions.On 4 June 2024 the Biden administration announced new actions to secure the border.While Biden continues to refer to the immigration system as \u201cbroken\u201d, he is most often referring to the US southern border with Mexico. This myopic view of immigration ignores the over one million international students studying in the US. Ignoring this population does not engender rapport or support globally, or within internationalisation contexts.Similarly, on 18 June 2024 the Biden administration announced new actions to keep families together.This announcement directly relates to people with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) status, which would not impact international student populations, and is limited to US citizens with non-citizen spouses and children and is not available for individuals. This signals both a preference for domestic policy and for the family unit.Because Biden includes nothing related to internationalisation, globalisation or international partnerships on his official platform, he is missing the opportunity to promote goodwill and soft power through tertiary education.Finally, during the 27 June presidential debate , the word \u2018education\u2019 was mentioned just once in relation to Biden\u2019s work with Pell Grants. The word \u2018immigration\u2019 was mentioned three times, all by moderator Jake Tapper. \u2018China\u2019, however, was mentioned 13 times and none of them positively by either candidate.If the rhetoric towards China continues to be one of contempt, US higher education institutions must be prepared for dramatic changes to applicant pools and patterns, for a shift in their English as a second language programming and for a drastically different economic funnel if prospective students and families from China determine that the Sinophobic rhetoric is a deterrent.Ultimately, the only pro-internationalisation rhetoric or policy prescription related to international students at higher education institutions in the US came from former president Trump but was soundly revoked just hours later by his campaign\u2019s press secretary.Both major candidates in the 2024 US presidential election are taking a stance that is nationalistic, exclusionary, isolationist and unwelcoming for prospective international students, especially those from China.If this rhetoric comes to fruition, it portends drastic and detrimental consequences for the US higher education sector just as it starts to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and is already struggling against a domestic demographic cliff.University World News.\n\nReceive email updates from UWN\n\n\n\nGlobal newsletters Africa newsletters Other\n\n(other includes related events and webinars)\n\n\n\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions Global newslettersAfrica newslettersOther",

        "text": "Trump to announce his vice-president pick: Who is in the running?\nTrump to announce his vice-president pick: Who is in the running?\n\nReuters\n\nDonald Trump is expected to announce within hours who he has chosen as his Republican running mate. His vice-presidential pick will be unveiled on the first day of the Republican party convention in Milwaukee on Monday, according to CBS News, the BBC's US partner. There are three names getting a lot of buzz - JD Vance, Doug Burgum and Marco Rubio - and they are reportedly in the final three. But there are plenty of others who could spring a surprise. Here's a rundown.\n\nJD Vance\n\nReuters\n\nJD Vance, 39, the junior senator from Ohio, has rallied support for Trump on several occasions in recent months. The Yale-educated former venture capitalist wrote the best-selling book Hillbilly Elegy, a memoir that followed his blue-collar upbringing in the \"rust-belt\" Midwest. Once a self-identified \"never-Trumper\", Mr Vance refashioned himself when he ran for the Senate in 2022 with Trump's crucial endorsement. In office, he has championed many of the issues that animate Trump's base. Mr Vance believes he would be of better use to a future Trump administration in the Senate, but he has not ruled out being vice-president. \"I want to help him however I can,\" he recently said. Trump has also dismissed a rumour floating that Mr Vance's beard would disqualify him - as the former president is reportedly averse to facial hair.\n\nDoug Burgum\n\nReuters\n\nAnother of Trump's fallen primary opponents, Doug Burgum, 67, is in his second term as governor of North Dakota. Mr Burgum made little impact as a presidential candidate but has returned to the campaign trail with his endorsement of Trump. A social conservative and fiscal hawk, he said in 2023 that he would never conduct business with Trump because \"you're judged by the company you keep\". Mr Burgum began his career with a small software start-up later acquired by Microsoft and his years of entrepreneurship have earned him a billionaire fortune. He is reported to have impressed Trump with his low-drama demeanour and political know-how - attributes that led to the selection of former VP Mike Pence in 2016. North Dakota's near-total abortion ban, which Mr Burgum supported, is \"a little bit of an issue\", Trump said during an interview on Fox News radio. \"I think Doug is great, but... he's taken a very strong stance,\" he said. Burgum has said he supports leaving abortion laws up to individual states, and a proposed Republican party platform has dropped a section calling for a nationwide abortion ban. The abortion issue drove Democratic voters to the polls in 2022's midterm elections.\n\nMarco Rubio\n\nReuters\n\nTrump and Marco Rubio did not get on in the 2016 Republican primary race. Trump called him \"Little Marco\" - a reference to his stature - while Mr Rubio commented about Trump's small hands. The Florida senator has since worked closely with his former rival, endorsing him early on in this primary season. The son of working-class Cuban immigrants, Mr Rubio was once floated as a potential running mate to 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney. At only 53 he is comparatively young and telegenic, and he could help Trump gain a larger share of the Latino vote. Mr Rubio spoke at a rally for Trump in Florida on Tuesday, and afterwards the presidential candidate said: \"He's very good... Marco was great last night, very popular. And he's certainly one of the people that we're looking at.\" The US Constitution could create a small procedural hurdle. It specifies that a state must cast its electoral votes for at least one candidate, president or vice-president who is not a resident of the state. Both Mr Rubio and Trump live in Florida, meaning the 30 electoral votes allocated to that state could be in doubt. In practice, the issue could be solved by a large victory for the Republican ticket, or one of the candidates moving out of the Sunshine State. In 2000, Dick Cheney moved his official residence from Texas to Wyoming to become the running mate of another Texan, George W Bush. Trump has said the issue doesn't rule out Mr Rubio, \"but it does make it more complicated.\"\n\nTim Scott\n\nGetty Images\n\nBeyond the leading trio, there is another group of possible contenders which includes Tim Scott. The South Carolina senator is arguably the most prominent black Republican in the country. He was among the competitors Trump defeated in the party's primary contest. Mr Scott, 58, pitched his brand of optimistic conservativism, in a play for the influential evangelical Christian vote in early voting states, but his campaign never caught fire. After struggling to raise money, and three lacklustre debate performances, he exited and quickly endorsed Trump. It was his rousing remarks at a Trump campaign rally before the New Hampshire primary that elevated him as a top contender for vice-president. \"We need Donald Trump,\" he said, before appearing on stage during his fellow Republican's victory speech. He told Trump: \"I just love you.\" With a smile, the former president responded: \"That's why you're a great politician.\" Since then, Trump has often remarked that Mr Scott is \"much better [at advocating] for me than he was for himself\".\n\nByron Donalds\n\nGetty Images\n\nByron Donalds, 45, has helped raise the profile of black conservatism. Born in New York to a single mother, Mr Donalds worked in banking, insurance and finance before entering local politics in Florida in 2012. After four years in the Florida House of Representatives, he has served since 2020 in the US House, representing the right-wing flank of his party in Washington. On 15 June, Mr Donalds joined Trump at a Michigan campaign event aimed at winning over black voters. The former president openly touted Mr Donalds as a potential running mate. \"Byron Donalds is an incredible guy, and I noticed he happens to be on the list of potential vice-presidents,\" Trump said. \"Would anyone like to see him as a vice-president?\" In an interview with Fox News, he played coy when asked if he had discussed the job with Trump. \"Maybe, maybe not,\" Mr Donalds said. \"I'm going to keep that to myself.\" \"I think President Trump is going to make a great decision,\" the congressman continued. \"Obviously it's his decision, his decision alone.\" Talk of his joining the ticket has cooled in recent days, however, as US media has reported that Trump's shortlist has narrowed.\n\nElise Stefanik\n\nGetty Images\n\nElise Stefanik, 40, is a New York congresswoman and the highest-ranking Republican woman in the US House of Representatives. The once-moderate Trump-hesitant Republican has drifted to the right in recent years, and is now widely considered one of Trump's most loyal defenders on Capitol Hill, even joining his defence at his first impeachment trial in 2020. In recent months, she has also risen to modest fame in media circles, with her viral take-down of two Ivy League college presidents and elevation of the issue of antisemitism on US college campuses. She has said that she would be \"honoured\" to serve in the Trump administration \"in any capacity\", but she too has not appeared on recent lists of the top contenders.\n\nTulsi Gabbard\n\nGetty Images\n\nAs a Democrat, she was the first Hindu member of the US Congress. Now Tulsi Gabbard may be the biggest dark horse on Trump's list. A decade ago, the Iraq War veteran and US Army reservist served as vice-chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee - before resigning to endorse Bernie Sanders's 2016 presidential campaign. Her time in Congress, from 2013-21, was marked by frequent criticisms of the Obama administration and US military interventionism. She ran in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, with her most notable moment being a fierce critique of Kamala Harris - now the vice-president - over her past as a prosecutor in California. Ms Gabbard, 43, then beefed up her contributions to Fox News and announced in 2022 that she was leaving the Democratic Party. But she would still be a huge surprise if chosen.\n\nKristi Noem\n\nGetty Images\n\nKristi Noem, the governor of South Dakota, once topped a poll taken by mostly Trump diehards on whom he should pick as his vice-president. Ms Noem, 52, rose to national prominence with appearances on Fox News, especially when she flouted mask mandates and other restrictions during the pandemic. Her star was very much on the rise until the release of her memoir, in which she recounted the story of shooting her 14-month-old dog, because it wasn't a good hunting companion. Cricket was \"untrainable\" and \"dangerous\", she said. She also shot a goat she thought was \"nasty\" and \"mean\". The story brought almost universal condemnation, and her odds of becoming VP have lengthened considerably.\n\nOther names in the mix",

        "text": "Trump picks Sen. JD Vance as VP running mate for 2024 election\nFormer President Donald Trump has chosen Sen. JD Vance of Ohio to be his vice presidential running mate this November. Trump announced his VP pick on social media just before he was to accept the presidential nomination at the in Milwaukee on Monday.\n\nA source familiar with Vance's selection told CBS News that Vance flew privately to Mar a Lago to meet with Trump Saturday morning. He received the call from Trump asking him to be his running mate 20 minutes before the former president announced his selection on social media.\n\nTrump said in his social media post, \"After lengthy deliberation and thought, and considering the tremendous talents of many others, I have decided that the person best suited to assume the position of Vice President of the United States is Senator J.D. Vance of the Great State of Ohio.\"\n\nFile: Sen, J. D. Vance, (R-OH) addresses the conservative Turning Point People's Convention on June 16, 2024 at Huntington Place in Detroit, Michigan. JEFF KOWALSKY/AFP via Getty Images\n\nHe said of Vance that he had \"honorably served our Country in the Marine Corps, graduated from Ohio State University in two years, Summa Cum Laude, and is a Yale Law School Graduate, where he was Editor of The Yale Law Journal, and President of the Yale Law Veterans Association.\"\n\nThe former president noted that Vance's book, \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" was a best-seller that \"championed the hardworking men and women of our Country.\" And he pointed to Vance's previous career as a venture capitalist.\n\nA source familiar with Vance's selection told CBS News that Vance flew privately to Mar a Lago to meet with Trump Saturday morning. He received the call from Trump asking him to be his running mate 20 minutes before the the former president announced his selection on social media.\n\nVance, who is just 39, is half Trump's age, is one of the youngest men to be a vice presidential nominee and is political neophyte, a first-term senator who's only been in office for about a year and a half.\n\nSources confirmed before Vance's selection was announced that Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, who were also considered to be top contenders for the No. 2 job, were informed that they had not been chosen. Upon the announcement that Vance was the pick, Burgum said in a social media post that his \"small town roots and service to country make him a powerful voice for the America First Agenda.\"\n\nAlthough Vance wasn't at the Pennsylvania rally where a shooter made an attempt on the former president's life, the senator expressed his concern and support for the president from Ohio. He also shared fundraising information for the families of those who were killed or injured at the rally.\n\n\"Courageous, United, and Defiant. This is leadership,\" Vance wrote on X over the weekend after Trump asked Americans to remain \"resilient\" in their faith and \"defiant in the face of wickedness.\"\n\nThe Trump campaign released a campaign video showing clips of Vance appearing on the campaign trail with Trump, and his TV appearances and concluded it with the Trump-Vance campaign logo.\n\nVance has frequently joined Trump on the campaign trail and was long considered to be on the shortlist of VP contenders. Vance and his wife, Usha, were spotted leaving their Ohio home Monday morning, a sign that Vance might be the pick.\n\nOhio has been a reliably Republican-dominated state in recent elections, although the senior senator from the state, Sherrod Brown, is a Democrat and is also up for reelection this year. But Trump has focused less on choosing a running mate from a key battleground state and more on the qualities in a candidate that matter most to him.\n\nTrump has prioritized picking a running mate who would be loyal to him and support him publicly, as Vance has increasingly done through the years.\n\nInitially, though, Vance harshly criticized Trump and was an avowed \"Never-Trump guy.\" Earlier this year, Fox News' Bett Baier confronted Vance with some of his previous statements, including comments that Trump could be \"America's Hitler\" and \"cultural heroin.\" Vance told Baier he was \"wrong\" about Trump.\n\n\"I think you should, when you are wrong about something, you should change your mind and be honest with people about that fact,\" Vance said in the interview.\n\nVance grew up in challenging circumstances, largely raised by his grandparents before going on to college and law school at Yale.\n\nNow one of Trump's most vocal allies, Vance defended the former president during his criminal trial in Manhattan, including after his conviction on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records for \"hush money\" payments.\n\n\"The entire purpose of this trial was to allow the media and the Democrats to say exactly that,\" Vance told CNN after the New York verdict. \"This was never about justice, this is about plastering 'convicted felon' all over the airwaves when in reality the only thing that Donald Trump is guilty of is being in the courtroom of a political sham trial.\"\n\nAsked in a June interview on \"Face the Nation\" about his interest in the vice presidency and his relatively brief experience in the Senate, Vance said, \"In 18 months \u2026 we've done a lot of good work for our constituents.\"\n\nVance represents a departure from Mike Pence, who was Trump's vice president in his first two presidential nominations. Vance has said in the past that he would have refused to certify the election on Jan. 6, 2020, if he had been in Pence's position.\n\n\"If I had been vice president, I would have told the states, like Pennsylvania, Georgia and so many others that we needed to have multiple slates of electors,\" he told ABC News in early February, \"and I think the U.S. Congress should have fought over it from there. That is the legitimate way to deal with an election that a lot of folks, including me, think had a lot of problems in 2020. I think that's what we should have done.\"\n\nIn 2020, Trump pressured Pence, who presided over the joint session of Congress that affirmed the results of the presidential election, to refuse to certify the electoral votes that showed Joe Biden had won. Pence did not agree to do so, concluding that his role was ceremonial, and he ultimately announced that Mr. Biden had won \u2014 after an attack on the Capitol that day. Since then, Trump has continued to publicly claim that Pence \"did have the right to change the outcome.\"\n\nThe job of the vice president is to read the results of each state according to the the 12th Amendment. The Electoral Count Act of 1877, the other law concerning the certification of votes, does not give vice presidents the power to overturn the vote either. Numerous legal experts have denied that there is any interpretation of these laws that would have given Pence the power to reject the outcome of the election on January 6.\n\nCaitlin Huey-Burns and Jacob Rosen contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Ask an expert: Health care in the 2024 presidential election\nUNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. \u2014 Health care has often taken a central role in political campaigns, and the 2024 presidential election is no different. But the debate around health care isn\u2019t just about policy. The issues at stake \u2014 such as health care coverage and affordability, reproductive health and substance use disorders \u2014 affect individuals and families in Pennsylvania and across the nation, making it a high priority among voters.\n\nPenn State News spoke with four faculty experts about the pressing issues and how it may impact voters and their families.\n\nQ: How has political polarization changed the way government approaches policy making, especially when it comes to key issues like health care?\n\nDaniel Mallinson, associate professor of public policy and administration at Penn State Harrisburg, studies why states adopt innovative policies and what we can learn from the individual and macro-level patterns of policy and is particularly interested in Pennsylvania state politics.\n\nMallinson: Our recent research has demonstrated that polarization is exaggerating the dynamics of policymaking in Congress. By that I mean that there are longer periods of relative stasis, where either nothing gets done or things change incrementally, but when change happens it tends to be bigger.\n\nHealth care, specifically the Affordable Care Act (ACA), is a good example. Changes to national health care policy took a very long time, but when the political dynamics were right, it resulted in a major policy change. We also see that those big changes tend to be less bipartisan, which helps explain the exaggeration in stasis for many policy areas.\n\nQ: How has the Affordable Care Act affected health care coverage and access? If the ACA is repealed, how does that affect me and my family?\n\nDennis Scanlon, distinguished professor of health policy and administration, studies health policy and reform and can speak to health care affordability and efforts to fairly distribute funding resulting from opioid manufacturers and distributors.\n\nScanlon: Overall, the Affordable Care Act has helped people get health insurance and increased the number of people with health insurance in the United States.\n\nIt\u2019s highly unlikely that the ACA is going to be repealed. If anything were to be repealed, it\u2019s more likely to be pieces of the ACA that are dismantled. The impact would depend on what pieces are dismantled and one\u2019s individual circumstances. For example, if an individual currently receives subsidies to buy insurance on the health care exchange and if those subsidies are broken up, that may influence their choice in terms of whether or not they become or stay insured.\n\nQ: How has the Dobbs decision \u2014 the landmark Supreme Court decision in June 2022 that overturned the constitutional right to abortion \u2014 changed reproductive health care such as patient access to care?\n\nSarah Horvath, associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Penn State College of Medicine, is available to discuss reproductive health care, including access to reproductive health services, contraceptive counseling, miscarriage management and the safety of mifepristone, one of two medications used in a medication abortion.\n\nHorvath: The impacts of the Dobbs decision are geographically dependent. Many of the total bans and early bans on abortion are clustered across a wide swath of the South. What we\u2019ve seen is that in those states, there\u2019s been a huge drop in overall volume of abortion care being provided. But if you look at the data from the whole country, we\u2019ve actually seen an increase in the volume of abortion care being provided.\n\nWhat that means is that people must travel for care. It\u2019s really deepened the inequities in access to care because those who have the resources to travel will travel and the people who don\u2019t can\u2019t.\n\nIt\u2019s also affecting access to ongoing pregnancy care because these policies have had a chilling effect on providers. Take Idaho, for example. It\u2019s a state that already had too few obstetricians and maternal-fetal medicine specialists, who care for high-risk pregnancies. There\u2019s been an exodus of providers from the state, which means that people toward the end of their pregnancies are now traveling to neighboring states just to access normal obstetrical care.\n\nQ: Have more restrictive reproductive health care policies had any surprising effects?\n\nHorvath: We\u2019re seeing a lot of trickle-down effects. I provide care for complex miscarriage, stillbirth, ectopic pregnancy and other conditions and we\u2019re seeing that the medications and techniques used to treat these conditions are affected too. There are states where the medication mifepristone isn\u2019t available for miscarriage management, even though we know it improves outcomes. It makes care more efficient, safer and better for mom, but we\u2019re not giving people access to this medication because of its association with abortion. Similarly, some medication to treat cancer or conditions like rheumatoid arthritis are harder to access because their historical association with abortion care. Women no longer can access these medications, but men can.\n\nWe\u2019re also witnessing brain-drain in the profession. It\u2019s not just OBGYN, but it\u2019s also impacting family medicine doctors and, in one survey, even psychiatrists were considering leaving states because of the lack of ability to provide full care to their patients. Even among medical students, there\u2019s been a decrease in interest in residency programs in state with abortion bans across the board in all specialties.\n\nQ: How has the increase in substance use disorders, particularly opioid use, affected our society both nationally and in our communities?\n\nAbenaa Jones, Ann Atherton Hertzler Early Career Professor in health and human development and assistant professor of human development and family studies, has expertise in the social and structural determinants of substance use among vulnerable populations.\n\nJones: Substance use continues to be a pressing national concern as drug overdose deaths continue to climb. Substance use affects communities and the nation through the breakdown of families, particularly when the criminal legal system and child welfare are involved, increases health care costs and loss of productivity, impacts educational attainment and increases in infectious diseases such as HIV and Hepatitis C.\n\nQ: Are there populations that are disproportionately affected by substance use disorders?\n\nJones: Populations most affected include vulnerable and marginalized groups who face a disproportionate burden of poverty and limited social mobility, and who live in under-resourced areas, such as rural communities or low-income urban areas. Moreover, available data suggests that soaring overdose deaths among racially/ethnically minoritized individuals are mainly attributed to poor quality drugs and fentanyl contamination often found in under-resourced areas and lack of access to quality substance use treatment, overdose reversal drugs and harm reduction services.\n\nFor more information or to speak with one of our election experts, contact mediarelations@psu.edu.",

But instead of accepting it, Trump set about a campaign to prove he was the rightful winner.\n\nClassified documents (criminal)\n\nTrump also faced charges over classified documents he allegedly took from the White House, including deleting CCTV footage of his staff moving boxes at his Florida home.\n\nHowever, a judge threw out this case against him on 15 July 2024.\n\nSpecial Counsel Jack Smith, who also charged Trump in relation to the 6 January Capitol riots, was leading the prosecution in relation to this case.\n\nHowever, Florida-based US District Aileen Cannon, who was nominated by Trump, agreed with the former president's defence lawyers that Mr Smith was unlawfully appointed to his role and did not have the authority to bring the case.\n\nThe judge also ruled that Mr Smith's office was improperly funded by the Justice Department.\n\nMr Smith's team vigorously contested the arguments made by Trump's defence team during hearings before Ms Cannon last month.\n\nTrump had been accused of risking some of the country's most sensitive security secrets by taking them from the Capitol to his Mar-a-Lago estate.\n\nDetails on the US nuclear weapons programmes, potential vulnerabilities of the US and its allies, and plans for retaliatory military attacks were in some of the documents, the federal indictment said.\n\nImage: Trump's home in Florida was raided in August last year\n\n'Hush money' (criminal)\n\nTrump was at the centre of a scheme to cover up \"hush money\" payments to buy the silence of a porn star in the days before the 2016 election.\n\nWhen revelations by Stormy Daniels of a sexual liaison with Trump threatened to upend his presidential campaign, he directed his lawyer to pay her $130,000 (\u00a3100,000) to keep her quiet.\n\nThe payment buried the story, and Trump was later elected to be the 45th president of the United States.\n\nIn a historic decision, a New York jury found him guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records to commit election fraud.\n\nImage: Pic: Steven Hirsch/pool via Reuters\n\nMs Daniels claimed she had a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006 and planned to sell her story 10 years later, just before the 2016 election.\n\nMichael Cohen, Trump's lawyer and fixer, testified that, upon learning that Ms Daniels planned to sell her story, Trump told him: \"This is a disaster, a total disaster. Women are going to hate me.\"\n\nPaying hush money is not illegal - the crime was the way in which Trump reimbursed Cohen and the reason the money was paid.\n\nAfter Trump was elected president, he repaid Cohen $420,000 (\u00a3324,000) which accounted for the $130,000 and other payments and bonuses, \"grossed up\" to account for tax liability.\n\nThe repayment was made in a series of cheques, which were recorded as legal expenses.\n\nThat was the crime - the falsification of business records, aggravated by the reason for it - the effort to conceal from voters a negative story that could have harmed Trump's election chances.\n\nThe former president was set to be sentenced on 11 July but this was later postponed until September,\n\nTrump faces a maximum sentence of four years in prison, though others convicted of the same crime often receive shorter sentences, fines or probation.\n\nFollow Sky News on WhatsApp Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky News Tap here\n\nHow has Trump tried to claim immunity in his cases?\n\nOn 1 July 2024, the US Supreme Court sent Trump's claim he is immune from prosecution for his actions while president back to a lower court.\n\nThis relates to the 6 January case, where while still president he encouraged his supporters to gather at Congress to oppose the approval of Mr Biden's 2020 election win.\n\nIn a historic 6-3 ruling, the justices said for the first time that former presidents have absolute immunity from prosecution for their official acts, but no immunity for unofficial acts.\n\nBut instead of deciding for themselves, the justices ordered lower courts to work out precisely how to apply their decision to Trump's case.\n\nThe lower court must now decide whether he was acting officially or privately.\n\nIt comes months after a US appeal court ruled in February that Trump does not have presidential immunity and could be prosecuted in relation to the Capitol riots case.\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free\n\nWhat about the civil cases?\n\nIn addition to the criminal cases, Trump has also fought two civil cases - where another party that is not the state brings him to court.\n\nIn May 2023 a jury in New York concluded that he sexually assaulted writer E Jean Carroll and then defamed her. He was ordered to make one payment to her of $5m (\u00a33.9m) and a second of $83.3m (\u00a364m).\n\nIn February 2024 he was fined $354.9m (\u00a3274m) by a judge in New York for inflating his wealth in order to secure easier terms on bank loans. He called the judgment a \"manifest injustice\".",

        "text": "US election risks and the impact of Trump\u2019s re-election odds on financial markets\nThe US presidential election that decides between Joe Biden and Donald Trump takes place on 5 November 2024. Platforms and personas of both candidates offer ample reasons for markets, as well as specific segments within them, to react to news in anticipation of the probable outcome of the vote. The candidates\u2019 agendas differ in key aspects, for instance regarding energy, fiscal, and trade policy: Biden plans to reinforce the US green transition and increase taxation on corporations and high earners; Trump plans to strongly reduce environmental spending, introduce incentives for more domestic oil and gas production, and reduce tax rates. Moreover, Trump has already proposed to tighten the US tariff policy, especially toward China, even beyond the recently introduced tariffs on goods connected to clean energy, semiconductors and metals. These differences imply uncertainty in future policies in key economic areas. As the gap in the polls between the two candidates is not large (Figure 1), there is ample room for markets to form and update views on most likely outcomes; as shown in Rodden et al. (2020), the combination of close elections and polarisation brings about large increases in economic policy uncertainty in the US.\n\nFigure 1 US electoral polls calculated as averages across pollsters (data in per cent)\n\nSource: Bloomberg. Last observation: 1 July 2024.\n\nWe show that election-related uncertainty is indeed increasingly priced in futures contracts. Equity markets expect an increase in volatility around the election date. Bilateral exchange rates vis-\u00e0-vis the dollar also feature a higher expected volatility around the election date, especially for currencies of countries more exposed to the risk of a tariff war and tightened immigration policies in the case of a Trump re-election.\n\nWe then set up a daily structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) model to estimate the effects of the increase in the probability of a Trump re-election on a wide set of financial variables, finding that the response of most indicators is consistent with Trump\u2019s proposed policies: more market-oriented, less environmentally friendly and less tilted on public debt sustainability. Our contribution, using financial instruments to gauge investors\u2019 assessment of political risk and exploring its implications from a macro-finance standpoint, fits in the literature on the effects of political uncertainty on financial markets (Moramarco et al. 2020, P\u00e1stor et al. 2014, Veronesi and P\u00e1stor 2017).\n\nVolatility related to the US election\n\nFirst, we describe some stylised facts on the volatility in financial markets around the next US election date, an approach inspired by the analysis of Kelly et al. (2016). Equity markets are expecting an increase in volatility around the election date. Compared to the Obama-Romney (2012) and Clinton-Trump (2016) electoral competitions, US election risk has emerged earlier. Since March 2024, futures contracts tied to the VIX \u2014 measuring expectations of near-term swings in the S&P 500 equities benchmark \u2014 have been pricing-in a rise in market volatility in October (with respect to previous months) and a fall after the election date in November (Figure 2). The same dynamics of expected volatility stood out in 2020, when Biden and Trump first competed for the presidency. Instead, in 2012 and 2016, markets started to expect a comparable rise in volatility in October only three months before the elections, and they did not anticipate a fall in November.\n\nFigure 2 Implied volatility in equity markets (in percentage points): Comparison across electoral years\n\nNote: The figure shows the differences between the price of futures contracts on the VIX expiring in two consecutive months. The futures contract expiring on a given date captures the implied volatility over the subsequent 30 days.\n\nSource: Refinitiv. Last observation: 1 July 2024.\n\nCurrency markets (FX) also expect high foreign exchange volatility around the US vote. To measure this phenomenon, we take the implied volatility extracted from options expiring in six months (i.e. after the elections) on the US dollar exchange rate to the main currencies, minus the implied volatility extracted from the same options expiring in three months: a positive difference emerging in the latest months (from May 2024 onwards) reveals expectations of an increase in foreign exchange volatility close to the election date. Expected foreign exchange volatility around the US elections is particularly pronounced for the Chinese yuan, the country more exposed to the risks of a potential tariff war (Figure 3). Nonetheless, the expected increase in volatility for the euro and the sterling vis-\u00e0-vis the dollar has also been on the rise since May. A possible rationalisation of these results is that a Trump victory arguably implies a more protectionist trade policy: Trump has already proposed a 10% import tariff across-the-board and supposedly he is also considering a 60% tariff on imports from China.\n\nFigure 3 Implied volatility in currency markets (data in percentage points)\n\nNote: difference between the implied volatility extracted from the six-month and three-month options on USD bilateral exchange rates.\n\nSource: Refinitiv. Last observation: 1 July 2024.\n\nEffects of a likely Trump re-election on financial markets\n\nTo assess the impact of an increased likelihood of a Trump re-election on financial markets, we estimate a nine variable, daily VAR model on the 3 January 2023 to 1 July 2024 period. We include the following variables: the Citigroup US macro surprises index to control for the state of the economy; the logarithm of Trump\u2019s election likelihood, computed as the ratio between the voting intention for Trump and that for Biden, which is our key variable of interest; the logarithm of the Brent oil price; the logarithm of the Move (which measures bond market volatility); the logarithm of the VIX (which measures equity market volatility); the ten-year government bond yield; the logarithm of the S&P500; the logarithm of the US nominal effective exchange rate (NEER; an increase denotes a US dollar appreciation); and inflation expectations (five-year, five-year forward inflation expectations).\n\nWe identify a shock to Trump\u2019s election likelihood using a recursive ordering based on short-run zero restrictions (Cholesky decomposition) with Trump\u2019s election probability ordered second after US macro surprises. The identifying assumption is that the Trump\u2019s election likelihood is cleansed by the daily changes in US macro surprises because those may lead voters to revise their decisions in the polls while, conversely, these surprises are exogenous with respect to election odds. We further assume that financial markets can respond to elections odds within the same day whereas election odds may be affected by financial developments only with a lag.\n\nWe find that a one standard deviation shock to Trump\u2019s election likelihood, which corresponds to an increase in the odds by about 0.6% on impact (Figure 4), leads to an increase in the volatility of the US bond market: this might suggest that markets are pricing-in a higher credit risk, perhaps because of expectations of higher budget deficits should Trump be elected. Instead, a higher probability of Trump\u2019s election is associated with a lower equity market volatility and higher stock prices, which is coherent with the more pro-market attitude of the Republican candidate.\n\nFigure 4 Effect of an increase in Trump\u2019s election likelihood\n\nNotes: This figure shows daily impulse response functions and 68-90% confidence intervals. Responses are in per cent, except for the ten-year yield (percentage points), and economic news (index).\n\nThe shock also leads to lower oil prices in line with higher expected supply of fossil fuels, likely reflecting Trump\u2019s scant interest in environmental matters, his scepticism of renewable energy, and a positive attitude toward strengthening the domestic commodity industry. Finally, the effects on the exchange rate and inflation expectations point to a small depreciation of the US dollar.\n\nIn a different specification we also include, one by one, the stock indices for individual sectors. We find the semiconductors, software, and defence-related industries to be the sectors most positively affected by a higher Trump likelihood of re-election. Probably, these are the strategic sectors that will benefit more from a higher degree of protectionism under a new Trump administration. We also estimate a model including corporate spreads (both on investment grade and high-yield bonds) and find that an increased likelihood of Trump\u2019s election leads to higher spreads. This might be perhaps the result of expectations of higher budget deficits, increasing perceived risk in the sovereign segment and inducing a repricing of corporate bonds, consistent with our baseline results.\n\nFigure 5 Trump\u2019s shocks retrieved from the structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model\n\nLast, we check whether the identified shock captures relevant news concerning the unfolding of the electoral competition. We plot the series and label some of the largest identified shocks (Figure 5). These spikes correspond to news concerning either the Republican campaign (when Ron DeSantis dropped out the presidential race in January 2024), or Trump\u2019s legal issues (his arrest in August 2023, and news about the fine concerning a fraud case in January 2024).\n\nAuthors\u2019 note: The opinions expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Bank of Italy.\n\nReferences\n\nKelly, B, L P\u00e1stor and P Veronesi (2016), \u201cThe Price of Political Uncertainty: Theory and Evidence from the Option Market\u201d, Journal of Finance 71(5): 2417-2480.\n\nMoramarco, G, G Trigilia and P Manasse (2020), \u201cPolitical risk and exchange rates: The lessons of Brexit\u201d, VoxEU.org, 17 February.\n\nP\u00e1stor, L, P Veronesi and B Kelly (2014), \u201cThe price of political uncertainty\u201d, VoxEU.org, 31 March.\n\nRodden, J, S Davis, A Baksy, N Bloom and S Baker (2020), \u201cPolarised elections raise economic uncertainty\u201d, VoxEU.org, 22 December.\n\nVeronesi, P and L P\u00e1stor (2017), \u201cExplaining the puzzle of high uncertainty and low market volatility\u201d, VoxEU.org, 25 May.",

        "text": "Safeguarding Moldova\u2019s Presidential Election and EU Referendum: A Pre-election Risk Assessment\nIntroduction\n\nThe Republic of Moldova is at a turning point, facing critical decisions that will define its future. The country\u2019s European orientation, backed by a national consensus according to recent polls, reflects citizens\u2019 desire for stability, prosperity, and a strengthened rule of law\u2014all of which they perceive as more accessible within the European Union. At the same time, Russia aims to thwart Moldova\u2019s pro-European aspirations and keep the country under its influence through interference in electoral processes and hybrid warfare tactics. In the context of Russia\u2019s hybrid war against Europe, the next 15 months will be crucial for Moldova.\n\nThe presidential election and referendum on European integration in October 2024 and the parliamentary election in 2025 will be the first voting since the EU Commission decided to open accession negotiations with Chi\u0219in\u0103u. These elections will play an important role in determining Moldova\u2019s path and testing the country\u2019s internal resilience in the face of external pressures. They are crucial not only for Moldova but also for its international partners, who need to assess and adjust their aid, whether it be technical assistance, economic support, or security cooperation.\n\nRussia attempted to wreak havoc on Moldova\u2019s democratic process in last year\u2019s races, and there is ample reason to believe that the Kremlin will do the same during this year\u2019s and next year\u2019s campaigns. Moldova is again likely to find itself organizing and conducting elections while countering strenuous efforts to destabilize them.",

        "text": "Biden admits Trump 'bullseye' comments a mistake\nBiden admits Trump 'bullseye' comments a mistake\n\nWatch: Trump \"in the prayers of Jill and me\", says Biden\n\nTrump made his first appearance at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee on Monday, to a rapturous welcome .\n\nMr Biden is set to speak at the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) convention in Las Vegas on Tuesday.\n\nAfter a brief pause following Saturday\u2019s attack, presidential campaign events now appear to be back under way.\n\nThe president told NBC's Lester Holt his campaign had a duty to clearly communicate the threat of a second Trump term, adding that his words were not the ones that needed to be tempered.\n\nMr Biden's remarks came in his first interview since the incident, in which he defended his rhetoric against Donald Trump and cited why it was important.\n\nUS President Joe Biden has said it was a mistake for him to say \"time to put Trump in a bullseye\", days before Saturday's assassination attempt on his election rival.\n\nDuring his NBC interview, Mr Biden described a phone call with Trump following the attempted assassination as \u201cvery cordial\u201d.\n\n\"I told him he was literally in the prayers of Jill and me, and his whole family was weathering this,\" he said.\n\nWhen pressed on his \"bullseye\" comments, Mr Biden said: \"It was a mistake to use the word. I didn't say crosshairs. I meant bullseye, I meant focus on him. Focus on what he's doing.\"\n\nHe said he meant Democrats needed to look at Trump, his policies and the false statements he made during the presidential debate late last month.\n\nAccording to Politico, Mr Biden had said on a private donor call: \"I have one job, and that's to beat Donald Trump. I'm absolutely certain I'm the best person to be able to do that. So, we're done talking about the debate. It\u2019s time to put Trump in a bullseye.\"\n\nThroughout the interview, Mr Biden made it clear he would not be stepping aside in the presidential race - despite calls from members of his own party after his poor debate performance.\n\n\"I'm old,\" he lamented, while also noting he's only three years older than Trump. He said his mental acuity was fine and listed his accomplishments as president - but acknowledged he was working to reaffirm to Americans that he was up to the job.\n\n\"I understand why people say, 'God, he\u2019s 81 years old. Whoa. What's he going to be when he\u2019s 83 years old, 84 years?' It\u2019s a legitimate question to ask,\" he said.\n\nHe said he put his faith in the voters who overwhelmingly backed him in the Democratic primary. \"I listen to them.\"\n\nThe president has repeatedly called for Americans to \"lower the temperature\" since the shooting on Saturday, where Trump's ear was grazed by a bullet.\n\nOne crowd member was killed and two others were critically injured in the attack.\n\nAbout a dozen Republicans have blamed Mr Biden and other Democrats for inciting the attempt on Trump's life. Many have specifically cited the \"bullseye\" comment.\n\nJD Vance, who was announced as Trump's presidential running mate on Monday, said in the wake of the shooting that Democratic rhetoric about the Republican candidate \"led directly to President Trump's attempted assassination\".\n\nPresident Biden, in an Oval Office address on Sunday, denounced the attack and called for Americans to \"take a step back\", warning that \"political rhetoric in this country has gotten very heated\".\n\nWhen asked in the NBC interview if he had also taken a step back to examine his past remarks for anything \"that could incite people who are not balanced\", Mr Biden said the inflammatory rhetoric had not come from him.\n\n\"I've not engaged in that rhetoric,\" Mr Biden said. \"Now, my opponent is engaged in that rhetoric.\n\n\"How do you talk about the threat to democracy, which is real, when a president says things like he says? Do you just not say anything, because it may incite somebody?\n\n\"I am not the guy that said I want to be a dictator on day one, I am not the guy that refused to accept the outcome of the election.\"\n\nThe FBI has identified the gunman who targeted Trump as Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, a kitchen worker from Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, who is a registered Republican.\n\nA Secret Service sniper shot Crooks dead after he fired at the former president.",

        "text": "Kellyanne Conway\nAmerican political consultant, pollster (born 1967)\n\nKellyanne Elizabeth Conway (n\u00e9e Fitzpatrick; born January 20, 1967) is an American political consultant and pollster who served as Senior Counselor to the President in the administration of Donald Trump from 2017 to 2020.[1][2][3][4] She was previously Trump's campaign manager, having been appointed in August 2016; Conway is the first woman to have run a successful U.S. presidential campaign.[5] She has previously held roles as campaign manager and strategist in the Republican Party and was formerly president and CEO of the Polling Company/WomanTrend.[6]\n\nConway lived in Trump World Tower from 2001 to 2008 and conducted private polls for Trump in late 2013 when he was considering running for governor of New York. In the 2016 Republican presidential primaries, Conway initially endorsed Ted Cruz and chaired a pro-Cruz political action committee.[7][8][9][10] After Cruz withdrew from the race, Trump appointed Conway as a senior advisor and later campaign manager.[11][12] On December 22, 2016, Trump announced that Conway would join his administration as counselor to the president.[13] On November 29, 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that Conway would oversee White House efforts to combat the opioid overdose epidemic.[14][15]\n\nAfter Trump's inauguration, Conway was embroiled in a series of controversies: using the phrase \"alternative facts\" to describe fictitious and disproven attendance numbers for Trump's inauguration; speaking multiple times of a \"Bowling Green massacre\" that never occurred; and claiming that Michael Flynn had the full confidence of the president hours before he was dismissed. Members of Congress from both parties called for an investigation of an apparent ethics violation after she publicly endorsed commercial products associated with the president's daughter, Ivanka Trump.[16] In June 2019, the U.S. Office of Special Counsel recommended that Conway be fired for \"unprecedented\" multiple violations of the Hatch Act of 1939.[17]\n\nIn August 2020, Conway left the administration. This came after months of a public feud between herself and her teenage daughter, Claudia, who lambasted her in the media, politically and personally, and threatened to seek legal emancipation.[18][19][20] In 2022, Conway joined Fox News as a contributor. She frequently appears as a guest/host on a variety of programs, including Hannity, The Five, Outnumbered, The Big Weekend Show, and more. Conway also contributed to Fox's 2022 Midterm Election coverage. Since 2024, Conway has been paid by the Club for Growth to advocate on behalf of TikTok and its parent company, ByteDance.\n\nIn July 2024, Fox News announced that Conway will host a weekly program on the network's streaming platform, Fox Nation, called Here's The Deal with Kellyanne Conway.\n\nEarly life\n\nKellyanne Elizabeth Fitzpatrick was born on January 20, 1967, in Camden, New Jersey, to Diane (n\u00e9e DiNatale) and John Fitzpatrick, and grew up in the nearby Atco section of Waterford Township, New Jersey.[21][22][23] Conway's father had German, English, and Irish ancestry, while her mother is of Italian descent;[24] John Fitzpatrick owned a small trucking company, and Diane worked at a bank. Conway's parents divorced when she was three,[25][26] and she was raised by her mother, grandmother, and two unmarried aunts in Atco. She graduated from St. Joseph High School in 1985 as class valedictorian in a high school with 140 students, total. In high school, she also sang in the choir, played field hockey, worked on floats for parades, and was a cheerleader.[27] A 1992 New Jersey Organized Crime Commission report identified Conway's grandfather, Jimmy \"The Brute\" DiNatale, as a mob associate of the Philadelphia crime family; DiNatale did not reside with Conway's grandmother, Conway, and the rest of her family.[25] Conway's cousin, Mark DeMarco, has stated that while in high school, Conway ordered members of the football team to stop bullying him; according to DeMarco, the bullying stopped.[28] Her family is Catholic.[22][29]\n\nConway credits her experience working for eight summers on a blueberry farm in Hammonton, New Jersey, for teaching her a strong work ethic. \"The faster you went, the more money you'd make,\" she said. At age 16, she won the New Jersey Blueberry Princess pageant. At age 20, she won the World Champion Blueberry Packing competition: \"Everything I learned about life and business started on that farm.\"[29]\n\nConway graduated magna cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts in political science from Trinity College, Washington, D.C. (now Trinity Washington University), where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.[30] She earned a Juris Doctor with honors from the George Washington University Law School in 1992.[31] After graduation, she served as a judicial clerk for Judge Richard A. Levie[32] of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia.[33][34][35]\n\nEarly career\n\nConway entered the polling business when she was in law school, working as a research assistant for Wirthlin Group, a Republican polling firm.[31] After graduating, she initially considered working for a law firm, but chose to work for Luntz Research Companies instead.[36] While a student at Trinity College, she had met and become friends with Frank Luntz, the founder, on a year abroad at Oxford University.[36] In 1995, she founded her own firm, the Polling Company. Conway's company has consulted on consumer trends, often trends regarding women. Conway's clients have included Vaseline, American Express and Hasbro.[37]\n\nIn the 1990s, Conway, along with other young conservative women Laura Ingraham, Barbara Olson, and Ann Coulter,[31] helped turn punditry into \"stylish stardom\" in both Washington and cable television[38][39] and credited with setting forth Washington, D.C.'s \"sexual awakening.\"[40] In another review of the era in the capital, Conway (then known as Fitzpatrick) put it that her \"broad mind and small waist have not switched places\".[41] Conway, Ingraham, and Coulter were sometimes called \"pundettes\",[42] and appeared on Bill Maher's Politically Incorrect.[31]\n\nConway worked for Representative Jack Kemp; Senator Fred Thompson;[35][better source needed] Vice President Dan Quayle;[43] Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich; and Representative (later Vice President) Mike Pence.[37] She worked as the senior advisor to Gingrich during his unsuccessful 2012 United States presidential election campaign.[44] Another client in 2012 was U.S. Senate candidate Todd Akin.[45]\n\nConway in 2015\n\nIn addition to her political opinion research work, Conway has directed demographic and attitudinal survey projects for trade associations and private companies, including American Express, ABC News, Major League Baseball, and Ladies Home Journal. Her firm The Polling Company also includes WomanTrend, a research and consulting division.[35]\n\nConway has appeared as a commentator on polling and the political scene, having appeared on ABC, CBS, NBC, PBS, CNN, MSNBC, NY1, and the Fox News Channel, in addition to various radio programs. She received the Washington Post's \"Crystal Ball\" award for accurately predicting the outcome of the 2004 election.[46]\n\nConway has been criticized as a spin doctor of high prominence, particularly in her role as cable TV spokesperson for the Trump Administration.[47] She has been lauded as a \"Trump whisperer.\"[8] As part of their long-running feud with Donald Trump,[48] the MSNBC show Morning Joe publicly \"banned\" Conway in February 2017.[49]\n\n2016 presidential election\n\nTed Cruz support and endorsement\n\nWhen the 2016 election campaigns got underway, Conway had been acquainted with Donald Trump for years because she lived in Trump World Tower from 2001 to 2008 and sat on the condo board.[8] Yet she initially endorsed Ted Cruz in the 2016 Republican presidential primary and chaired a pro-Cruz political action committee known as Keep the Promise I, which was almost entirely funded by businessman Robert Mercer.[50][51] Conway's organization criticized Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump as \"extreme\" and \"not a conservative\".[9][10] On January 25, 2016, Conway criticized Trump as \"a man who seems to be offending his way to the nomination.\"[52] On January 26, Conway criticized Trump's use of eminent domain, saying, \"Donald Trump has literally bulldozed over the little guy to get his way.\"[53]\n\nIn mid-June 2016, Cruz suspended his campaign and Conway left.[54]\n\nTrump campaign\n\nOn July 1, 2016, Trump announced that he had hired Conway for a senior advisory position on his presidential campaign.[55] Conway was expected to advise Trump on how to better appeal to female voters.[55] On August 19, following the resignation of Paul Manafort, Trump named Conway the campaign's third campaign manager.[37][56] She served in this capacity for 10 weeks, through the November 8 general election, and was the first woman to successfully run an American presidential campaign,[57] and the first woman to run a Republican general election presidential campaign.[56] Saturday Night Live started satirizing her in October 2016, portrayed by Kate McKinnon.[58][59][60] In a January 2017 interview, Conway acknowledged the SNL parody by noting that, \"Kate McKinnon clearly sees the road to the future runs through me and not Hillary.\"[61][62]\n\nPresidential transition\n\nOn November 10, 2016, Conway publicly tweeted that Trump had offered her a White House job.[63] \"I can have any job I want\", she said on November 28.[64] On November 24, Conway tweeted that she was \"Receiving deluge of social media & private comms re: Romney. Some Trump loyalists warn against Romney as sec of state\" with a link to an article on Trump loyalists' discontent for the 2012 nominee. Conway told CNN she was only tweeting what she has shared with President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence in private.[65]\n\nOn November 28, two top sources at the Trump transition team told media outlets that Trump \"was furious\" at Conway for media comments she made on Trump administration cabinet appointments.[66] The following day, however, Trump released a written statement stating that the campaign sources were wrong and that he had expressed disappointment at her critical comments on Romney.[67] CNBC reported on November 28 that senior officials in the Trump transition \"have reportedly been growing frustrated by Conway's failure to become a team player.\"[64]\n\nOn December 1, Conway appeared with senior aides of the Trump campaign at Harvard Kennedy School for a forum on the 2016 presidential race; the quadrennial post-presidential election forum has been held at the School of Government since 1972. Sitting across from Conway were senior Clinton campaign aides, including Clinton's campaign manager Robby Mook. As tempers began to flare, the forum escalated into a \"shouting match\"; during one exchange, Clinton senior strategist Joel Benenson said \"The fact of the matter is that more Americans voted for Hillary Clinton than for Donald Trump.\" Conway replied to Benenson while looking at the Trump aides: \"Hey, guys, we won. You don't have to respond. He was the better candidate. That's why he won.\"[68]\n\nIn early December, Conway claimed that Hillary Clinton supporters were making death threats against her.[69] Consequently, Trump assigned Secret Service to protect her.[70][71][72] Conway gave up her Secret Service protection in September 2017 due to \"reduction in threats.\"[73][74][75]\n\nWhite House advisor\n\nConway speaking to press outside the White House in 2019\n\nInauguration fight\n\nAccording to eyewitnesses, Conway allegedly punched a tuxedo-clad man at an exclusive inauguration ball just hours after Trump was sworn in as president.[76][77] In an attempt to break up a scuffle, Conway stepped between two men, but they would not break up the fight, and Conway apparently punched one of them in the face with closed fists at least three times.[78]\n\nIt was not immediately clear what triggered the fistfight and a Trump spokeswoman did not return a request for comment.[79]\n\n\"Alternative facts\"\n\nDuring a Meet the Press interview two days after Trump's presidential inauguration, Conway used the phrase \"alternative facts\" to defend statements made by White House press secretary Sean Spicer regarding the inauguration's crowd size.[80][81][82] Conway's phrase reminded some of \"Newspeak\", an obfuscatory language style that is a key element of the society portrayed in George Orwell's dystopian novel 1984.[83] Soon after Conway's interview, sales of the book had increased by 9,500%, which The New York Times and others attributed to Conway's use of the phrase, making it the number-one bestseller on Amazon.com.[84]\n\nThe Guardian noted that \"[a] search of several online legal dictionaries, however, did not yield any results for the term.\"[85]\n\nBowling Green massacre\n\nOn February 2, 2017, Conway appeared in a television news show interview on Hardball with Chris Matthews. In order to justify President Trump's immigration ban, she referenced an event allegedly perpetrated by Iraqi terrorists she termed the \"Bowling Green massacre\". Such an event never took place.[86][87] Vox suggested Conway was referring to the 2011 arrest of two Iraqi refugees in Bowling Green, Kentucky.[87] Conway stated the next day that she meant to say \"Bowling Green terrorists\", both of whom had pleaded guilty to carrying out and supporting attacks on American soldiers in Iraq.[88] There was never any suggestion that they had planned to carry out attacks in the United States.[89]\n\nOn February 5, 2017, New York University journalism professor Jay Rosen argued that, given repeated misstatements of fact, Conway should cease being booked as a guest on television news shows. CNN opted not to book Conway as a guest that day because of what the network said were \"serious questions about her credibility.\"[90][91]\n\nEthics violations under the Hatch Act\n\nThe Hatch Act of 1939 states that federal government employees must not advocate their political beliefs while representing a public office. Violating such a law can result in such an employee being removed from public office, but not jailed.[92] Conway has been accused of breaching the act on several occasions:\n\nCommercial promotion\n\nOn February 9, 2017, during an appearance on Fox & Friends, Conway discussed department store Nordstrom's decision to drop products supplied by Ivanka Trump's business. \"Go buy Ivanka's stuff is what I would tell you\", said Conway; she elaborated \"It's a wonderful line. I own some of it. I'm going to give a free commercial here: Go buy it today, everybody. You can find it online\".[93][94] Within hours, two organizations filed formal ethics complaints against Conway for violating federal law prohibiting use of a federal position \"for the endorsement of any product, service or enterprise\".[95] Public Citizen asked the Office of Governmental Ethics (OGE) to investigate, saying that Conway's remarks reflected \"an on-going careless regard of the conflicts of interest laws and regulations of some members of the Trump family and Trump Administration\". The group's president, Robert Weissman, declared, \"Since she said it was an advertisement, that both eliminates any question about whether outsiders are unfairly reading into what's being said, and two, it makes clear that wasn't an inadvertent remark\".[96] Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington filed a similar complaint with the OGE and with the White House Counsel's Office;[97] the group's executive director, Noah Bookbinder, stated \"This seems to us to be about as clear-cut a violation as you can find\".[98]\n\nHarvard constitutional law professor Laurence Tribe told The New York Times \"You couldn't think of a clearer example of violating the ban of using your government position as kind of a walking billboard for products or services offered by a private individual,\" adding \"She is attempting quite crudely to enrich Ivanka and therefore the president's family.\"[98] Chris Lu, deputy secretary of labor in the Obama administration, complained to Jason Chaffetz, chair of the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, that Conway had violated federal ethics laws,[99] also saying on Twitter that, under Obama, \"If we did what @KellyannePolls did, we would've been fired\".[100] Richard Painter, chief ethics attorney for George W. Bush, declined to say whether he thought Conway's statements broke the law, but that such actions would not have been tolerated in the Bush administration. \"The events of the past week demonstrate that there is no intent on the part of the president, his family or the White House staff to make meaningful distinctions between his official capacity as president and the Trump family business\".[98] At the regularly scheduled afternoon press briefing, Sean Spicer told reporters that \"Kellyanne has been counseled, and that's all we are going to go with ... She's been counseled on the subject, and that's it.\"[101] In a direct rebuke to Spicer, Conway tweeted that Trump \"likes 'counselor' more than 'counseled.'\"[102][103]\n\nConway's comments drew bipartisan Congressional condemnation. Chaffetz, a Republican, called them \"clearly over the line\" and \"unacceptable\". Cummings, a Democrat and the committee's ranking member, called them \"jaw-dropping\".[104] Both Chaffetz and Cummings wrote the OGE on February 9, 2017, requesting that Conway's behavior be investigated and that the office recommend \"suggested disciplinary action, if warranted\".[16]\n\nOn November 24, 2017, Walter Shaub, the former director of the OGE, said that he filed an ethics complaint against Conway.[105] He argued that Conway violated the Hatch Act when she criticized Doug Jones, a candidate in the 2017 U.S. Senate special election in Alabama.[105] On March 6, 2018, the U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) \u2013 led by Trump appointee Henry Kerner \u2013 issued its final report, determining that Conway violated the Hatch Act in two television interviews in November and December 2017.[106][107]\n\nConway continued to make frequent television appearances and comment on political topics. In May 2019, Conway declared: \"If you\u2019re trying to silence me through the Hatch Act, it's not going to work ... Let me know when the jail sentence starts\".[108]\n\nOn June 13, 2019, the OSC formally recommended that Conway be removed from federal service, citing multiple Hatch Act violations by Conway since the preparation of its 2018 report, \"by disparaging Democratic presidential candidates while speaking in her official capacity during television interviews and on social media\". The OSC noted her criticism from February to May 2019 of candidates such as Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders, Beto O'Rourke, Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden and Kirsten Gillibrand, and also called her violations \"egregious, notorious, and ongoing\". The OSC noted that this was the first time they \"had to issue multiple reports to the President concerning Hatch Act violations by the same individual\".[17][109][110] In an interview, Kerner characterized his agency's recommendation as unprecedented, adding, \"You know what else is unprecedented? Kellyanne Conway\u2019s behavior.\"[17]\n\nDue to Conway's status as a presidential appointee, the OSC was unable to take any steps to implement its recommendation, but it was submitted to the President for consideration.[111][112][113] The White House immediately rejected the finding and demanded that it be withdrawn by the OSC.[114] Trump said he thought the recommendation was \"very unfair, it's called freedom of speech.\"[115]\n\nOn June 26, 2019, Conway did not appear at a hearing by the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, leading that committee to issue a subpoena for her. At that hearing, Special Counsel Henry Kerner testified that Conway had been found guilty of two Hatch Act violations in 2018 and 11 in 2019. In comparison, during the eight years of the Obama administration, only two federal employees were found guilty of violating the Hatch Act, with one violation each.[116]\n\nOn February 13, 2017, Conway claimed that former national security advisor Michael Flynn had the president's \"full confidence\". Hours later, Flynn resigned.[117] The following day, Conway claimed Flynn had offered to resign, but White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said Trump had asked Flynn for his resignation.[117] It was then reported that Conway had allegedly leaked negative stories about Spicer to the press.[118]\n\nConway came under widespread criticism because her comments about Flynn had been so inaccurate. On February 15, 2017, Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin said Conway should be banned from future television appearances. \"In recent days, George Stephanopoulos and Matt Lauer blasted her directly, essentially calling her a fabulist. Given all that, it would be irresponsible for any news show to put her out there, suggesting she really does not know what is going on at any given moment\", Rubin wrote.[119] Also, on February 15, the MSNBC news show Morning Joe officially banned her from future appearances. The show's primary host Joe Scarborough said the decision to ban Conway from the show was based on her being \"out of the loop\" and \"in none of the key meetings\". He added \"She's not briefed. She's just saying things just to get in front of the TV to prove her relevance.\"[49] The show's co-host Mika Brzezinski said, \"I don't believe in fake news, or information that is not true... every time I've ever seen her on television, something's askew, off or incorrect.\"[49]\n\nFor the week following her Flynn comments, she did not appear on any television shows, and it was reported that the White House had sidelined Conway.[117] Denying the report, White House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders told CNNMoney that Conway was going to make many appearances during the week, and Conway told CNN journalist Dylan Byers that she would be appearing on Fox News that evening.[117] The week-long absence from television finally ended when she appeared on an episode of Hannity during the Conservative Political Action Conference.[120]\n\nOval Office couch photograph\n\nConway came under criticism when she was photographed sitting on an Oval Office couch with her legs folded beneath her\u2014shoes pressed against the upholstery\u2014during President Trump's meeting with leaders from historically black colleges and universities.[121][122] Some observers suggested the sitting position was a sign of disrespect and a lack of decorum.[123] Body language expert Patti Wood asserted that Conway's posture was not only rude but \"rather sexual\" and a sign that she \"doesn't have to follow the rules\" because she was \"buddies with Trump.\"[124] Conway later addressed the controversy with Lou Dobbs, saying that she was asked to take photographs of the meeting from a certain angle and that she certainly meant \"no disrespect.\" She also blamed the media for the ensuing furor.[125][123]\n\nSubsequent activities\n\nIn September 2021, President Biden sent Conway a letter requesting that she resign from her position on the United States Air Force Academy's board of visitors, informing her that she'd otherwise be dismissed from it. Biden sent similar letters to eleven other political officials that Trump had appointed to military academy boards. Conway refused President Biden's request that she resign, and argued that her removal from the board broke norms, politicized the post, and would discourage others from serving on such boards in the future.[126][127][128] Conway, who had no prior connection to the Air Force, had been appointed to the board by Trump in the final weeks of his presidency.[129]\n\nIn 2022, Conway joined Fox News as a contributor.[130] She frequently appears as a guest/host on a variety of programs, including Hannity, The Five, Outnumbered, The Big Weekend Show, and more. Conway also contributed to Fox's 2022 Midterm Election coverage. In July 2024, Fox News announced that Conway will host a weekly program on the network's streaming platform, Fox Nation, called Here's The Deal with Kellyanne Conway.[131]\n\nIn April 2022, Conway joined the board of the America First Policy Institute.[132] In November 2022, Conway gave an on the record interview to the United States House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack.[133] On March 1, 2023, Conway spoke with prosecutors from the Manhattan district attorney's office as part of their criminal investigation into Trump[134]\n\nSince 2024, Conway has been paid by the Club for Growth to advocate on behalf of the social media app TikTok and its parent company, ByteDance.[135] In this capacity, Conway lobbied against efforts to restrict or force the sale of TikTok amid congressional consideration of the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act.[136]\n\nIn December 2023, Conway met with congressional Republicans and argued that it was electorally necessary for them to support protections of access to birth control, citing public approval for such protection.[137] Shortly after the Supreme Court of Alabama delivered their February 2024 ruling in LePage v. Center for Reproductive Medicine, Conway's firm shared polls that they had conducted demonstrating broad public support for protections of IVF and fertility treatments, even among Americans opposed to abortion and self-identifying evangelicals.[138]\n\nConway delivered a speech during on the third night of the 2024 Republican National Convention.[139]\n\nPolitical views\n\nConway addressing the 2017 March for Life in Washington, D.C.\n\nConway views herself as a Generation X conservative.[140][141] Conway is anti-abortion, saying in 1996: \"We're pro-life. The fetus beat us. We grew up with sonograms. We know life when we see it.\"[141] She spoke at the 2017 March for Life, an annual rally protesting abortion and Roe v. Wade.[142]\n\nShe does not consider herself a feminist \"in a classical sense\", saying that she believes the term is associated with being \"anti-male\" and \"pro-abortion\", but identifies as what she calls an \"individual feminist\".[143] Conway has opined that many feminists fail to accept women who are pro-life and conservative, and that they \"'mainly care about what happens from the waist down... It's an insult. You know, it's [from] the waist up for me \u2013 my eyes, my ears, my head, my heart, my mouth certainly.'\"[28] She has also said that \"nobody cared\" about her experience with sexual harassment and her Me Too moment because of her political views.[144]\n\nPersonal life\n\nConway was married to George Conway,[145] who is of counsel at the law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, and wrote the Supreme Court brief for Paula Jones during the Clinton impeachment in 1998.[146][147] The couple have four children: twins Claudia and George IV, Charlotte, and Vanessa.[147] Prior to Trump's presidency, they lived in Alpine, New Jersey.[35][148][149] Prior to her marriage, Conway dated senator Fred Thompson.[150]\n\nGeorge Conway is a critic of Trump; in December 2019 he co-founded the Lincoln Project, which campaigned against Donald Trump's re-election from a conservative perspective.[151] In March 2019, President Trump responded to criticism from Kellyanne's husband George by describing George as a \"stone cold LOSER & husband from hell\".[152] Kellyanne defended Trump by saying that George Conway is \"not a psychiatrist\" and that Trump should not be expected to respond when George, \"a non-medical professional accuses him of having a mental disorder\".[153]\n\nConway's daughter Claudia is a TikTok influencer who became known in 2020, at age 15, for her anti-Trump messages.[154][155][156][157] In July 2020 she said that her parents' marriage had \"failed\".[156] Claudia identifies as a leftist and liberal[158][159] and described her TikTok fan base as \"leftist, A.C.A.B. (All Cops Are Bastards), anti-trump, blm (Black Lives Matter)\".[160] In August 2020, Claudia Conway announced she was seeking emancipation.[161] In January 2021, she claimed that her mother has been \"physically, mentally, and emotionally abusive,\" posting videos on TikTok appearing to show her mother screaming at and even once hitting her.[162] On January 25, 2021, Kellyanne Conway's official Twitter account shared a topless photo of a girl later confirmed to be Claudia Conway.[163] New Jersey police launched an investigation into the matter.[164] At age 16, Claudia Conway appeared as a contestant on, but was eliminated from, American Idol.[165]\n\nIn September 2019, Conway's cousin Giovanna Coia, who was then White House press assistant, married Vice President Mike Pence's nephew John Pence, who worked for the Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign.[166][167][168]\n\nOne of the few White House staffers to have had protection from the Secret Service due to various threats, Conway chose \"Blueberry\" as her Secret Service code name because of associations with the fruit from her youth in pageants and berry picking.[169]\n\nIn a September 2018 interview with Jake Tapper on CNN, Conway stated she was the victim of a sexual assault.[170][171]\n\nOn August 23, 2020, Conway announced her resignation in order to \"spend more time with her family,\"[172] as did her husband George, who announced he had taken time off from the Lincoln Project and Twitter.[173]\n\nIn March 2023, George and Kellyanne announced that they were divorcing after 22 years of marriage.[174]\n\nAwards\n\nBooks\n\nIn 2005, Conway and Democratic pollster Celinda Lake co-authored What Women Really Want: How American Women Are Quietly Erasing Political, Racial, Class, and Religious Lines to Change the Way We Live (Free Press/Simon & Schuster, 2005; ISBN 0-7432-7382-6).\n\nIn 2022, Conway authored Here's the Deal: A Memoir (Threshold Editions, 2022; ISBN 1982187344).",

        "text": "Can Biden be replaced as Democrats' nominee? Not so easily\nCan Biden be replaced as nominee? Not so easily\n\nGetty Images\n\nPressure is growing on Joe Biden to step aside after his poorly received performance in the first presidential debate against Donald Trump. With November's election bearing down, a growing number of senior Democrats are speaking publicly or privately about their concerns. The top two Democrats in the US Congress, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, have told him they fear he will be a drag on their members running for election. More than 20 other lawmakers have publicly broken ranks, as have prominent supporters and party donors. Mr Biden has in recent weeks defiantly vowed to stay in the race but now a Covid infection will sideline him for days. Let's run through the possible scenarios.\n\nCan Joe Biden withdraw?\n\nYes, if - and it's a big if - Mr Biden decides to step down as the Democratic Party's standard bearer, it would be relatively straightforward to find another candidate. The party's nominee will officially be chosen at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Chicago from 19-22 August. The Democrats are reportedly planning to nominate Mr Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris virtually ahead of that gathering. There, a candidate must win support from the majority of \"delegates\" - party officials who formally choose the nominee. Delegates are assigned to candidates proportionally based on the results of each state's primary election. This year, Mr Biden won almost 99% of the nearly 4,000 delegates. According to DNC rules, those delegates are \"pledged\" to support the incumbent president.\n\nBiden 'not going anywhere' despite unclear moments in July 4 speech\n\nIf Mr Biden willingly drops out, it could turn into a free-for-all. Democrats would be left with an open convention where they would suggest potential nominees and continue voting until one receives the majority of delegate votes. That could spark a frantic contest among Democrats vying for a shot at the nomination. Mr Biden has so far given no indication that he would consider stepping aside. But if he decides to do so, \"that opens up an entirely different can of worms\", political historian Leah Wright Rigueur told BBC News. \"I think that if he were to get replaced, part of the negotiation for him stepping down would be that he would get the final say in who replaces him,\" she said.\n\nCould he be forced out?\n\nIf he doesn't want to go, this is where the process gets really tricky. In the modern political era, a major national party has never tried a hostile takeover of the nomination. However, DNC regulations do have some loopholes that could, in theory, make it possible to push Mr Biden out. The rules allow delegates to \"in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them\", meaning they could look to someone else. \"It could be an incredibly ugly scenario,\" Ms Wright Rigueur said. Experts told BBC News they doubt there would be a revolt among party delegates. But the DNC can alter party rules at any point. Ms Wright Rigueur pointed to 1968, when President Lyndon B Johnson decided not to run for re-election. The party shifted from an open convention process, in which delegates could cast ballots for whomever they chose, to a bound process, where a delegate was attached to a candidate based on primary results. Even if Mr Biden were suddenly to exit the race, conservative groups have vowed to file lawsuits challenging the legality of any replacement Democrat's eligibility for the ballot.\n\nMore on the election\n\nWill Kamala Harris replace Biden?\n\nVice-President Kamala Harris would automatically take Mr Biden's place if he were to step down during his presidential term. But the same rules do not apply if Mr Biden pulls out as a candidate for November's election race, and there is no mechanism in place that would give the vice-president an upper hand at an open convention. Instead, Ms Harris would have to win the majority of delegates, just like any other candidate. It may be that Mr Biden backs her to replace him if he steps aside. As she is already on the Democratic ticket, Ms Harris would have access to all the campaign funds currently available to the president. And she has a national profile. But her relatively low popularity among the American public might dull that advantage.\n\nCould the 25th Amendment be invoked?",

        "text": "Trump's national lead over Biden grows \u2014 CBS News poll\nWhen former President Donald Trump accepts the Republican nomination Thursday night, he'll do so with his largest national lead over President Biden in the campaign thus far.\n\nA slight majority, including some who aren't voting for him, say Trump's words in the days since the assassination attempt have been more unifying than divisive. Voters feel the same way about Mr. Biden's response to the tragic events, too.\n\nBut it is Trump with the growing advantage in the vote. Trump is up five points nationally now, and three across the key battleground states. To put that national lead in context: it's been 20 years since a Republican presidential candidate has won the national popular vote, and over 30 years since a Republican won by more than five.\n\nThe race across the battlegrounds moved one point more toward Trump today since we surveyed the battlegrounds last week.\n\nFor voters, Trump's perceived handling of the assassination attempt is a net-positive reason to consider voting for him, but that effect is limited overall; for two-thirds, it has not changed their consideration calculus either way.\n\nOf the candidates atop the party tickets, Trump is the one more voters feel fights \"a lot\" for people like them.\n\nAmid the nomination debate on the Democratic side, Trump also leads Vice President Kamala Harris in a hypothetical matchup. There are at best marginal differences in how she and Mr. Biden currently run among demographic groups, such as younger voters and voters of color.\n\nA still substantial part of his party feels Mr. Biden should step aside as nominee, and Democrats continue to lag behind Republicans on their expressed likelihood of turning out this year.\n\nThere is a bipartisan view \u2014 though particularly among Republicans \u2014 that the U.S. Secret Service could have done more to prevent the shooting on Saturday.\n\nMr. Biden also responded to the events, and most Americans also think he's encouraged unity, including a third of Trump voters.\n\nFor all that, eight in 10 voters feel that civility in U.S. politics has gotten worse in recent years, and most expect an increase in political violence in the future.\n\nJD Vance\n\nThe addition of Sen. JD Vance to the GOP ticket is being viewed positively by Republican voters: most are at least satisfied, and half are enthusiastic about the choice. This is particularly true among the MAGA wing of the party.\n\nThis CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a representative sample of 2,247 registered voters nationwide interviewed between July 16-18, 2024. The sample was weighted by gender, age, race, and education, based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as past vote. Respondents were selected to be representative of registered voters nationwide. The margin of error for registered voters is \u00b12.7 points. Battlegrounds are AZ GA MI NC NV PA WI.\n\nToplines:\n\n",

But they are preparing for a Donald Trump victory \u2014 which some say they failed to do the first time round.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz from the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) has a close and friendly relationship with US President Joe Biden. Scholz has made no secret of his hope that Biden will beat Republican challenger Donald Trump in the presidential election later this year.\n\nThat's a mistake, says Jens Spahn of Germany's largest opposition party, the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), which was in a coalition with the SPD during Trump's first term in office from 2016 to 2020.\n\n\"I think Trump will very likely be the next president of the US,\" Spahn told DW on the sidelines of the Republican convention in Milwaukee this week. \"We shouldn't make the same mistake we did during his last presidency. Back then, no one had a network of contacts with Trump's team. This time we should know beforehand and build up contacts with him and his team. That's why it's important to be here.\"\n\n'Without the US, Europe can't be secure': German lawmaker To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nUncertain future for Ukraine\n\nConcern has mounted in Germany with the nomination of JD Vance as Trump's running mate, who has doubled down on cutting US support for Ukraine. \"I don't really care what happens to Ukraine,\" Vance famously said in an interview with former Trump adviser, Steve Bannon, just a few days before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nLeading German figures are paying heed to the warning. Under Trump's leadership, \"the US would set different priorities. Europe would have to take care of its own defense and also take on most of the burden of supporting Ukraine,\" Christoph Heusgen, chairman of the Munich Security Conference (MSC) told the news agency Reuters.\n\nTrump had in fact already demanded that Germany and Europe step up their own defense during his presidency.\n\n\"But the problem is that Germany and Europe are much more vulnerable today than they were in 2016, because Russia is not only threatening Ukraine, but the whole of Europe, and Europe is still very dependent on the US in terms of security policy,\" Dominik Tolksdorf from the German Council on Foreign Relations (DGAP) told DW.\n\n\"However, Europeans can at least assess Trump better today than in 2016,\" he added. \"If Donald Trump were to win the election, we should still look for ways to maintain reasonably constructive relations.\"\n\nLong-range US weapons in Germany\n\nBehind the scenes, German leaders have long been preparing for a possible second Trump presidency, according to Michael Link, a lawmaker of the smallest party in Scholz's coalition, the neoliberal Free Democrats (FDP).\n\nLink is the the German government's transatlantic coordinator, and also attended the US Republican Party convention in Milwaukee as a guest. \"The biggest challenge for any preparations is Trump's unpredictability,\" Link told DW. \"No one can say for sure which parts of his political program Trump would implement in a second term. We must therefore strengthen our own ability to act. That goes for the European Union above all.\"\n\nIn response to the perceived threat from Russia, Germany has significantly boosted its defense spending. Chancellor Scholz took a further step just a few days ago at the NATO summit in Washington, where he agreed with President Biden to station long-range US weapons in Germany.\n\n\"Many of the weapons systems that have now been agreed on were first considered during Trump's presidency,\" Tim Thies of the Institute for Peace Research and Security Policy in Hamburg told DW. And in fact, according to German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, Germany will foot the bill for the deployment. \"The German government seems to be anticipating any demands from a possible future President Trump,\" Thies remarked.\n\nWould a Trump presidency hurt German firms? To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nRemembering Trump's first term in office\n\nIn 2016, German politicians were caught by surprise when Donald Trump beat Hilary Clinton in the presidential race. Several of them had made some extremely undiplomatic comments during that election campaign, most notably then-Foreign Minister and current German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who called Trump a \"hate preacher.\"\n\nMichael Link points out that Biden respects Germany as a partner, and also the EU as an institution and has invested much in multilateral partnerships such as the G7 and the UN.\n\nA second Trump administration would be dramatically different, Link fears: \"Trump relies on bilateral relations and new transactional 'deals' instead of existing alliances. He does not respect the EU as an equal partner and would try to play the European states off against each other,\" Link warned.\n\nHowever, he is also certain: \"If Donald Trump is re-elected, despite all the America First rhetoric, he will realize that the US will still be dependent on allies,\" said Link, pointing to relations with China as an example: \"The US and the EU can have a much greater impact if they work together instead of working against each other.\"\n\nThis article was originally written in German.\n\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

One senior party official told the BBC that many in the party felt Mr Biden's stepping down was \"inevitable\".\n\nJoe Biden's campaign faced further pressure on Thursday amid reported concerns from Barack Obama about the presidential election, a darkening mood among Democrats and polls suggesting Donald Trump was pulling ahead.\n\nCan Biden be replaced as nominee? Not so easily\n\nMr Obama was reported by the Washington Post to have privately stated Mr Biden's chances were greatly diminished. Spokespeople for the former president have declined to comment.\n\nThe most recent lawmaker to pull support from Biden's run is Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown. On Friday, the Democrat released a statement saying it is his ''job to keep fighting'' for his constituents.\n\n\u201cI agree with the many Ohioans who have reached out to me. At this critical time, our full attention must return to these important issues. I think the President should end his campaign,\" he said.\n\nIt followed several reports that former house speaker Nancy Pelosi and the two most senior Democrats in Congress, Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer, had advised Mr Biden to consider his candidacy for the good of the party. All have rejected the reports.\n\nBut a senior Democrat source told BBC News that the mood in Washington was grim, adding: \"We are all waiting for the inevitable decision.\"\n\nAdam Smith, a Democratic congressman for Washington state, painted a similarly grim picture. Asked by BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight whether the party was \"coming to the end\" of Mr Biden's candidacy, he said: \"That is my sense\".\n\n\"I mean, I don\u2019t know. But without question, I think that is the direction that this is heading right now.\"\n\nMr Biden has faced a torrid few weeks since his poor showing in the first presidential debate late last month. He is currently in isolation in Delaware while he recovers from a Covid infection.\n\nBy contrast, Donald Trump officially accepted his party's presidential nomination at the Republican national convention in Milwaukee on Thursday evening.\n\nHe struck a confident tone in his first speech since surviving an assassination attempt. Delegates and supporters at the convention have been in high spirits all week.\n\nMr Biden has so far taken a defiant tone in response to Democratic pressure for him to step aside as his party's candidate. He continues to enjoy the public support of many politicians, including members of the powerful Congressional black caucus.\n\nMr Schumer, the Senate Majority Leader and Mr Jeffries, the ranking Democrat in the House of Representatives, are reported to have told Mr Biden last week that their colleagues in Congress were \"concerned\" that his troubles would hit their own chances of re-election.\n\nMr Schumer said the reports were \"idle speculation\", while Mr Jeffries said his was \"a private conversation that will remain private\".\n\nCNN meanwhile reported that Mrs Pelosi had told Mr Biden that polls show he cannot win. She later slammed the reporting as a \"feeding frenzy\", but did not deny that a conversation with Mr Biden had taken place.\n\nJamie Raskin, a congressman from Maryland, wrote to Mr Biden, comparing him to a baseball pitcher at the end of his career - saying there was \"no shame\" in retiring \"to the overflowing appreciation of the crowd when your arm is tired out\".\n\nBut TJ Ducklo, a Biden campaign senior adviser, slammed reports of grandee concern as \"baseless conjecture from anonymous sources\".\n\n\"Joe Biden is his party's nominee,\" he wrote on X. \"He's running for re-election.\"\n\nDeputy campaign manager Quentin Fulks said Mr Biden was \"not wavering on anything. The president has made his decision.

        "text": "Election 2024: Will Joe Biden Exit the Presidential Race?\nThe nation turned its eyes to Milwaukee last night as Donald J. Trump accepted the Republican Party\u2019s presidential nomination for the third election in a row. But the question on everyone\u2019s mind inside and outside the Fiserv Forum was, who will be his opponent in November?\n\nThe pressure on Joe Biden to step aside as the Democratic presidential candidate that died down last week flared again this week. The news media reported that former President Barack Obama, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, and House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi each told Biden privately in their own way that his chances of winning were fading and that he would be imperiling the party if he stayed in the race. Jon Tester of Montana and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico became the second and third Democratic senators to call on Biden to head to the sidelines. California Democratic Senate candidate Adam Schiff, a close confidant of Pelosi\u2019s, added his name to those urging Biden to step down. Just this morning, four Democratic Congressmen asked Biden \u201cto pass the torch to a new generation of Democratic leaders.\u201d More defections, possibly a stampede of them, seem likely.\n\nBiden, who tested positive for Covid on Wednesday and had to leave the campaign trail, can\u2019t find much comfort in poll numbers or campaign contributions. An AP-NORC poll out this week found that 65 percent of Democrats want him to leave the race, and just 27 percent are very or extremely confident about his mental capacity to be an effective president. Campaign contributions in July have fallen to less than half the $50 million originally projected.\n\nThe Water's Edge James M.

The Democratic Party\u2019s rules establish a process for replacing a potential nominee.\n\nThe question is instead whether Biden will leave the race. It is difficult, though not impossible, to push him off the ticket. But that would mean a bruising internal fight that would likely guarantee what Biden\u2019s critics are seeking to prevent\u2014Trump\u2019s election. That outcome could happen even if Biden bows out gracefully. Presidential campaigns are unforgiving, especially for new candidates and campaign organizations in flux.\n\nBiden continues to signal that he will remain in the race. His campaign chair told Morning Joe today that he will return to the campaign trail next week. That, of course, is not dispositive. If Biden decides to step aside, it\u2019s in his interest and the Democratic Party\u2019s to break that news rather than telegraph it.\n\nOne group rooting for Biden to stay in the race is the Trump campaign. It has built its Election 2024 strategy around attacking his weaknesses. Indeed, Trump advisers have attacked the dump-Biden movement as illegitimate. Senior Trump campaign adviser Chris LaCivita yesterday called the effort an \u201cattempted coup.\u201d If Biden does stand down, former Trump adviser Stephen Miller has signaled the Trump campaign\u2019s likely line of attack: \u201cNothing says democracy like holding a fake primary and then having donors handpick a nominee behind closed doors.\u201d\n\nWhether Biden stays in the race or not, the protracted debate over his fitness will only further complicate U.S. foreign policy. As I have noted before, countries, like people, hedge their bets. Many foreign capitals are already concluding that they will be dealing with a new president next January and trimming their sails accordingly. And if Biden does decide to step aside, he will automatically become a lame duck. That will raise a whole new set of questions and challenges.\n\nCampaign Update\n\nLast Saturday night\u2019s attempted assassination of Trump shocked the world and raised difficult questions about why the Secret Service and other law enforcement officials ignored warning signs that a shooter threatened the president. What\u2019s unknown is how the shooting will affect the presidential race, both in terms of tone and outcome. Fears of violence on the campaign trail were voiced long before Saturday. Democratic and Republican leaders\u2014there were exceptions\u2014joined Trump and Biden in calling for calm and a lowering of the political rhetoric, but fears about escalating violence and the fraying of U.S. democracy remain real. Adding an additional layer of concern are reports that the U.S. intelligence community has compiled substantial evidence that Iran is seeking to assassinate Trump.\n\nWith the selection of J.D. Vance as Trump\u2019s running mate, Democrats and Republicans have turned to negotiations over the timing and host of a vice-presidential debate. Trump agreed back in May on behalf of his yet-to-be-named nominee to a debate on either July 23 or August 13, or on an unspecified date after the Democratic National Convention closed. Harris had previously agreed to the July and August dates. The sticking point was which network would host the event. Harris agreed to appear on CBS, while Trump called for the debate to be on Fox. The July 23 date is no longer an option, and given the uncertainty about the Democratic ticket, August 13 likely isn\u2019t either.\n\nJudge Aileen Cannon dismissed the case that Special Counsel Jack Smith filed charging Trump with mishandling classified-documents case. Cannon based her ruling on the grounds that Smith's appointment was unconstitutional. Cannon\u2019s decision rejected longstanding precedent and builds on a point that Justice Clarence Thomas made in his concurring opinion in the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision on Trump\u2019s claim to unqualified presidential immunity. The Justice Department will likely appeal Cannon\u2019s ruling. Regardless of how that appeal fares, Trump will not face prosecution on the classified-documents charges before Election Day.\n\nWhat the Candidates Are Saying\n\nTrump\u2019s acceptance speech to the Republican National Convention last night set the record for length. It clocked in at a shade over ninety-two minutes. He beat the old record, which he set back in 2016, by nearly eighteen minutes.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Trump at RNC Video Pause Video Pause Trump at RNC Embed\n\nTrump didn\u2019t break any new policy ground in his remarks. As usual, he made a number of false claims, which news outlets fact-checked even if many voters don\u2019t seem to care. On the foreign policy front, he didn\u2019t stop North Korean missile launches\u2014they resumed before he left office. He didn\u2019t defeat ISIS in a \u201ccouple of months.\u201d The fight against ISIS, which began during Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, continued for more than two years into his presidency. And while China signed a $50 billion trade deal with Trump, it didn\u2019t live up to the terms of the agreement. The United States didn\u2019t leave $85 billion worth of military equipment behind in Afghanistan; the number was closer to $7 billion.\n\nBloomberg Businessweek ran a story this week based on an interview with Trump at Mar-a-Lago. Much of the interview addressed economic matters. But Trump\u2019s answer to whether he would defend Taiwan against Chinese aggression likely set off alarm bells in Taipei and triggered smiles in Beijing. Trump complained that Taiwan took away the U.S. chip industry and said:\n\nTaiwan should pay us for defense. You know, we\u2019re no different than an insurance company. Taiwan doesn\u2019t give us anything. Taiwan is 9,500 miles away. It\u2019s 68 miles away from China. A slight advantage, and China\u2019s a massive piece of land, they could just bombard it.\n\nHe went on to add that if he were China \u201cI wouldn\u2019t feel so secure right now.\u201d No doubt.\n\nJoe Biden sat down with Lester Holt of NBC News for a one-on-one interview. Most of the conversation dealt with Biden\u2019s reaction to the attempted assassination of Trump, heated rhetoric on the campaign trail, and Biden\u2019s fitness for office. Foreign policy did not get a mention.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Biden Holt Interview Video Pause Video Pause Biden Holt Interview Embed\n\nBiden did apologize for saying a week ago that \u201cit\u2019s time to put Trump in the bull\u2019s-eye.\u201d\n\nWhat the Pundits Are Saying\n\nPolitico\u2019s Jonathan Martin detailed the alarm that Trump\u2019s pick of Vance to be his running mate has created among internationalist Republicans. Martin doesn\u2019t pull any punches about the division within the GOP over how active the United States should be in the world and where: \u201cTrump didn\u2019t just select a running mate here\u2014he doused political kerosene on the raging Republican fire over foreign policy.\u201d\n\nThe New Yorker\u2019s Jonathan Blitzer explored the evolution of the network of far-right groups that are championing Trump\u2019s election and creating the agenda they hope he will enact should he return to the White House. Blitzer wrote that \u201cthe Trump campaign has tried to distance itself from the most radical aspects of Project 2025. There are no benefits\u2014only political liabilities\u2014to endorsing so many specifics. Trump\u2019s supporters already know what he stands for, in a general sense. And there is the more delicate matter of the former President\u2019s ego. \u2018He wouldn\u2019t want to be seen as taking guidance from any other human being,\u2019 the former senior White House official told me. \u2018He doesn\u2019t like to be seen as someone who doesn\u2019t know everything already.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhat the Polls Show\n\nThe Pew Research Center issued a report today showing that American adults under the age of thirty have different foreign policy priorities than their elders do. Six-out-of-ten Americans between the ages of eighteen and twenty-nine flag combating climate change as their top priority. Only about four-in-ten Americans over the age of thirty feel the same way. Conversely, nine-in-ten Americans over the age of fifty see preventing terrorism as a top priority. Just 55 percent of young Americans do. The young and the old show similar divergences on issues such as Iran, Israel, NATO, and Ukraine, with younger voters being less supportive. One thing to keep in mind. Older Americans are far more likely to vote than younger ones.\n\nThe Campaign Schedule\n\nThe Democratic National Convention opens in Chicago in thirty-one days (August 19, 2024).\n\nThe second presidential debate is in fifty-three days (September 10, 2024).\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s sentencing hearing on his New York felony convictions is in sixty-one days (September 18, 2024).\n\nThe first in-person absentee voting in the nation begins in Minnesota and South Dakota in sixty-three days (September 20, 2024).\n\nElection Day is 109 days away.\n\nInauguration Day is 185 days away.\n\nAliya Kaisar assisted in the preparation of this post.",

        "text": "FiveThirtyEight\nAmerican news website\n\n538, originally rendered as FiveThirtyEight, is an American website that focused on opinion poll analysis, politics, economics, and sports blogging in the United States.[2] Founder Nate Silver left in 2023, taking the rights to his forecasting model with him to his website Silver Bulletin.[3][4][5] 538's new owner Disney hired G. Elliott Morris to develop a new model.[3][4] On September 18, 2023, the original website domain at fivethirtyeight.com was closed, and web traffic became redirected to ABC News pages.[2] The logo was replaced, with the name 538 now used instead of FiveThirtyEight.\n\nThe website, which takes its name from the number of electors in the United States electoral college,[538 1] was founded on March 7, 2008, as a polling aggregation website with a blog created by analyst Nate Silver. In August 2010, the blog became a licensed feature of The New York Times online and was renamed FiveThirtyEight: Nate Silver's Political Calculus. In July 2013, ESPN acquired FiveThirtyEight, hiring Silver as editor-in-chief and a contributor for ESPN.com; the new publication launched on March 17, 2014.[6] Since then, the FiveThirtyEight blog has covered a broad spectrum of subjects including politics, sports, science, economics, and popular culture. In 2018, the operations were transferred from ESPN to sister property ABC News (also under parent The Walt Disney Company).\n\nDuring the presidential primaries and general election of 2008 the site compiled polling data through a unique methodology derived from Silver's experience in sabermetrics to \"balance out the polls with comparative demographic data\".[7][8] Silver weighted \"each poll based on the pollster's historical track record, sample size, and recentness of the poll\".[9] Since the 2008 election, the site has published articles\u2014typically creating or analyzing statistical information\u2014on a wide variety of topics in current politics and political news. These included a monthly update on the prospects for turnover in the Senate; federal economic policies; Congressional support for legislation; public support for health care reform, global warming legislation and LGBT rights; elections around the world; marijuana legalization; and numerous other topics. The site and its founder are best known for election forecasts, including the 2012 presidential election in which FiveThirtyEight correctly predicted the vote winner of all 50 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nFiveThirtyEight has won numerous awards. These include Bloggie Awards for Best Political Coverage in 2008 and Best Weblog about Politics in 2009 as well as Webbies for Best Political Blog in 2012 and 2013. While under the ownership of ESPN in 2016, FiveThirtyEight won the Data Journalism Website of the Year award from the Global Editors Network.\n\nMethods [ edit ]\n\nOne aspect of the site is Silver's efforts to rank pollsters by accuracy, weight their polls accordingly, and then supplement those polls with his own electoral projections based on demographics and prior voting patterns. Silver said: \"I did think there was room for a more sophisticated way of handling these things.\"[10][11]\n\nFiveThirtyEight weighs pollsters' historical track records through a complex methodology,[538 2] and assigns them values to indicate \"Pollster-Introduced Error\". At its base, Silver's method is similar to other analysts' approaches to taking advantage of the multiple polls that are conducted within each state: he averaged the polling results. But especially in the early months of the election season polling in many states is sparse and episodic. The \"average\" of polls over an extended period (perhaps several weeks) would neither reveal the true state of voter preferences at the present time, nor provide an accurate forecast of the future. One approach to this problem was followed by Pollster.com: if enough polls were available, it computed a locally weighted moving average or LOESS.\n\nWhile adopting such an approach in his own analysis, Silver reasoned that there was additional information available in polls from \"similar\" states that might help to fill the gaps in information about the trends in a given state. Accordingly, he adapted an approach that he had previously used in his baseball forecasting: using nearest neighbor analysis he first identified \"most similar states\" and then factored into his electoral projections for a given state the polling information from \"similar states\". He carried this approach one step further by also factoring national polling trends into the estimates for a given state. Thus, his projections were not simply based on the polling trends in a given state.\n\nFurthermore, a basic intuition that Silver drew from his analysis of the 2008 Democratic party primary elections was that the voting history of a state or Congressional district provided clues to current voting. This is what allowed him to beat all the pollsters in his forecasts in the Democratic primaries in North Carolina and Indiana, for example.[12] Using such information allowed Silver to come up with estimates of the vote preferences even in states for which there were few if any polls. For his general election projections for each state, in addition to relying on the available polls in a given state and \"similar states\", Silver estimated a \"538 regression\" using historical voting information along with demographic characteristics of the states to create an estimate that he treated as a separate poll (equivalent to the actually available polls from that state). This approach helped to stabilize his projections, because if there were few if any polls in a given state, the state forecast was largely determined by the 538 regression estimate.\n\nTransparency of pollster ratings [ edit ]\n\nOn June 6, 2010, FiveThirtyEight posted pollster rankings that updated and elaborated Silver's efforts from the 2008 election. Silver expanded the database to more than 4,700 election polls and developed a model for rating the polls that was more sophisticated than his original rankings.[538 3][13] Silver responded on 538: \"Where's the transparency? Well, it's here [citing his June 6 article], in an article that contains 4,807 words and 18 footnotes. Every detail of how the pollster ratings are calculated is explained. It's also here [referring to another article], in the form of Pollster Scorecards, a feature which we'll continue to roll out over the coming weeks for each of the major polling firms, and which will explain in some detail how we arrive at the particular rating that we did for each one\".[538 4]\n\nAs for why the complete 538 polling database had not been released publicly, Silver responded: \"The principal reason is because I don't know that I'm legally entitled to do so. The polling database was compiled from approximately eight or ten distinct data sources, which were disclosed in a comment which I posted shortly after the pollster ratings were released, and which are detailed again at the end of this article. These include some subscription services, and others from websites that are direct competitors of this one. Although polls contained in these databases are ultimately a matter of the public record and clearly we feel as though we have every right to use them for research purposes, I don't know what rights we might have to re-publish their data in full.\" Silver also commented on the fact that the 538 ratings had contributed to Markos Moulitsas's decision to end Daily Kos's use of Research 2000 as its pollster.[14]\n\nOn June 11, 2010, Mark Blumenthal also commented on the question of transparency in an article in the National Journal titled \"Transparency In Rating: Nate Silver's Impressive Ranking Of Pollsters' Accuracy Is Less Impressive In Making Clear What Data Is Used\".[15] He noted that in the case of Research 2000 there were some discrepancies between what Silver reported and what the pollster itself reported. Other researchers questioned aspects of the methodology.[16]\n\nOn June 16, 2010, Silver announced on his blog that he is willing to give all pollsters who he had included in his rating a list of their polls that he had in his archive, along with the key information that he used (poll marginals, sample size, dates of administration); and he encouraged the pollsters to examine the lists and the results to compare them with the pollster's own record and make corrections.[538 5]\n\nIn September 2014, Silver put into the public domain all of his pollster ratings,[538 6] as well as descriptive summary data for all of the more than 6,600 polls in his data collection for the final three weeks of U.S. presidential primaries and general elections, state governor elections, and U.S. Senate and U.S. Congress elections for the years 1998\u20132012.[17] In addition to updating his pollster ratings, he published an updated methodological report.[538 7]\n\nOrigin [ edit ]\n\nLogo for FiveThirtyEight until 2023\n\nNate Silver started FiveThirtyEight in early March 2008, published under the pseudonym Poblano, the same name that he had used since November 2007 when he began publishing a diary on the political blog Daily Kos.[18] The name FiveThirtyEight derives from the 538 electors in the United States Electoral College.[19] Writing for Daily Kos, Silver had gained a following, especially for his primary election forecast on Super Tuesday, February 5, 2008.[20][21] From that primary election day, which included contests in 24 states plus American Samoa, Poblano predicted that Barack Obama would come away with 859 delegates, and Hillary Clinton 829; in the final contests, Obama won 847 delegates and Clinton 834. Based on this result, New York Times op-ed columnist William Kristol wrote: \"And an interesting regression analysis at the Daily Kos Web site (poblano.dailykos.com) of the determinants of the Democratic vote so far, applied to the demographics of the Ohio electorate, suggests that Obama has a better chance than is generally realized in Ohio\".[22]\n\nFiveThirtyEight gained further national attention for beating out most pollsters' projections in the North Carolina and Indiana Democratic party primaries on May 6, 2008. As Mark Blumenthal wrote in National Journal, \"Over the last week, an anonymous blogger who writes under the pseudonym Poblano did something bold on his blog, FiveThirtyEight.com. He posted predictions for the upcoming primaries based not on polling data, but on a statistical model driven mostly by demographic and past vote data. ... Critics scoffed. Most of the public polls pointed to a close race in North Carolina. ... But a funny thing happened. The model got it right.\"[12] Silver relied on demographic data and on the history of voting in other states during the 2008 Democratic primary elections.[10] On May 30, 2008, Silver revealed his true identity for the first time to his FiveThirtyEight readers.[538 8] After that date, he published just four more diaries on Daily Kos.[18]\n\nAs the primary season was coming to an end, Silver began to build a model for the general election race. This model, too, relied in part on demographic information but mainly involved a complex method of aggregating polling results. In 2008, Rasmussen Reports had an apparently short-term partnership with FiveThirtyEight in order to include this unique methodology for generating poll averages in their \"Balance of Power Calculator\".[23] At the same time, FiveThirtyEight's daily \"Today's Polls\" column began to be mirrored on \"The Plank\", a blog published by The New Republic.[24]\n\nIn July 2008, the site began to report regular updates of projections of 2008 U.S. Senate races. Special procedures were developed relying on both polls and demographic analysis. The projections were updated on a weekly basis.[538 9]\n\nBy early October 2008, FiveThirtyEight approached 2.5 million visitors per week, while averaging approximately 400,000 per weekday.[538 10] During October 2008 the site received 3.63 million unique visitors, 20.57 million site visits, and 32.18 million page views.[538 11] On Election Day, November 4, 2008, the site had nearly 5 million page views.[25]\n\nFinal projections of 2008 elections [ edit ]\n\nIn the final update of his presidential forecast model at midday of November 4, 2008, Silver projected a popular vote victory by 6.1 percentage points for Barack Obama and electoral vote totals of 349 (based on a probabilistic projection) or 353 (based on fixed projections of each state).[538 12] Obama won with 365 electoral college votes. Silver's predictions matched the actual results everywhere except in Indiana and the 2nd congressional district of Nebraska, which awards an electoral vote separately from the rest of the state. His projected national popular vote differential was below the actual figure of 7.2 points.\n\nThe forecasts for the Senate proved to be correct for every race, but the near stalemate in Minnesota led to a recount that was settled only on June 30, 2009. In Alaska, after a protracted counting of ballots, on November 19 Republican incumbent Ted Stevens conceded the seat to Democrat Mark Begich, an outcome that Silver had forecast on election day.[26] In Georgia, a run-off election on December 2 led to the re-election of Republican Saxby Chambliss, a result that was also consistent with Silver's original projection.\n\nThe ground game and \"On the Road\" [ edit ]\n\nDuring the 2008 electoral campaign, Sean Quinn, a second contributor, drew on his knowledge and experience with campaign organizations to evaluate the ground game and \"get out the vote\" strategies of the McCain and Obama campaign teams. A poker player, Quinn drew an analogy between Barack Obama's electoral strategy and a poker player having multiple \"outs\" for winning a hand.[27]\n\nIn September, Quinn launched a series of essays under the name On the Road.[28] Quinn traveled from state to state telling the story of the campaign from the electoral battleground, drawing on observations and interviews with grassroots campaign workers.\n\nAfter the 2008 U.S. election [ edit ]\n\nFocus [ edit ]\n\nDuring the first two months after the election, no major innovations in content were introduced. A substantial percentage of the articles focused on Senatorial races: the runoff in Georgia, won by Saxby Chambliss; recounts of votes in Alaska (won by Mark Begich), and Minnesota (Al Franken vs. Norm Coleman); and the appointments of Senatorial replacements in Colorado, New York, and Illinois.\n\nAfter President Obama's inauguration, Sean Quinn reported that he was moving to Washington, D.C., to continue political writing from that locale.[538 13] On February 4, 2009, he became the first blogger to join the White House press corps.[538 14] After that time, however, he contributed only a handful of articles to FiveThirtyEight.\n\nDuring the post-2008 election period Silver devoted attention to developing some tools for the analysis of forthcoming 2010 Congressional elections,[538 15][538 16] as well as discussing policy issues and the policy agenda for the Obama administration, especially economic policies.[538 17][538 18] He developed a list of 2010 Senate races in which he made monthly updates of predicted party turnover.[538 19]\n\nLater, Silver adapted his methods to address a variety of issues of the day, including health care reform, climate change, unemployment, and popular support for same-sex marriage.[29] He wrote a series of columns investigating the credibility of polls by Georgia-based firm Strategic Vision, LLC. According to Silver's analysis, Strategic Vision's data displayed statistical anomalies that were inconsistent with random polling. Later, he uncovered indirect evidence that Strategic Vision may have gone as far as to fabricate the results of a citizenship survey taken by Oklahoma high school students, which led him to denounce Strategic Vision as \"disreputable and fraudulent\".[30][538 20][538 21][538 22][538 23][538 24][31][a] FiveThirtyEight devoted more than a dozen articles to the Iranian presidential election in June 2009, assessing of the quality of the vote counting. International affairs columnist Renard Sexton began the series with an analysis of polling leading up to the election;[538 25] then posts by Silver, Andrew Gelman and Sexton analyzed the reported returns and political implications.[538 26]\n\nFiveThirtyEight covered the November 3, 2009, elections in the United States in detail.[538 27][538 28] FiveThirtyEight writers Schaller, Gelman, and Silver also gave extensive coverage to the January 19, 2010 Massachusetts special election to the U.S. Senate. The \"538 model\" once again aggregated the disparate polls to correctly predict that the Republican Scott Brown would win.[538 29]\n\nIn spring 2010, FiveThirtyEight turned a focus on the United Kingdom general election scheduled for May 6, with a series of more than forty articles on the subject that culminated in projections of the number of seats that the three major parties were expected to win.[538 30] Following a number of preview posts in January[538 31] and February,[538 32] Renard Sexton examined subjects such as the UK polling industry[538 33][538 34][538 35] and the 'surge' of the third-party Liberal Democrats,[538 36] while Silver, Sexton and Dan Berman[b] developed a seat projection model. The UK election was the first time the FiveThirtyEight team did an election night 'liveblog' of a non-U.S. election.[538 37]\n\nIn April 2010, The Guardian published Silver's predictions for the 2010 United Kingdom General Election. The majority of polling organisations in the UK use the concept of uniform swing to predict the outcome of elections. However, by applying his own methodology, Silver produced very different results, which suggested that a Conservative victory might have been the most likely outcome.[33] After a series of articles, including critiques and responses to other electoral analysts, his \"final projection\" was published on the eve of the election.[538 38] In the end, Silver's projections were off the mark, particularly compared with those of some other organizations, and Silver wrote a post mortem on his blog.[538 39] Silver examined the pitfalls of the forecasting process,[538 39] while Sexton discussed the final government agreement between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats.[538 40]\n\nPartnership with The New York Times: 2010\u20132013 [ edit ]\n\nOn June 3, 2010, Silver announced that in early August the blog would be \"relaunched under a NYTimes.com domain\".[538 41][34][35] The transition took place on August 25, 2010, with the publication of Silver's first FiveThirtyEight blog article online in The New York Times.[538 42]\n\nOn June 3, 2010, The New York Times and Silver announced that FiveThirtyEight had formed a partnership under which the blog would be hosted by the Times for a period of three years.[36] In legal terms, FiveThirtyEight granted a \"license\" to the Times to publish the blog. The blog would be listed under the \"Politics\" tab of the News section of the Times.[37] FiveThirtyEight would thus be subject to and benefit from editing and technical production by the Times, while FiveThirtyEight would be responsible for creating the content.\n\nSilver received bids from several major media entities before selecting the Times.[37][38] Under terms of the agreement, Silver would also write monthly articles for the print version of both the newspaper and the Sunday magazine.[538 41] Silver did not move his blog to the highest bidder, because he was concerned with maintaining his own voice while gaining the exposure and technical support that a larger media company could provide. \"There's a bit of a Groucho Marx quality to it [Silver has said]. ... You shouldn't want to belong to any media brand that seems desperate to have you as a member, even though they'll probably offer the most cash\".[39]\n\nThe first column of the renamed FiveThirtyEight: Nate Silver's Political Calculus appeared in the Times on August 25, 2010, with the introduction of U.S. Senate election forecasts. At the same time, Silver published a brief history of the blog.[538 43] All columns from the original FiveThirtyEight were also archived for public access.[40]\n\nShortly after FiveThirtyEight relocated to The New York Times, Silver introduced his prediction models for the 2010 elections to the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives, and state Governorships. Each of these models relied initially on a combination of electoral history, demographics, and polling. The 538 model had forecast a net pickup of 8 seats by the Republicans in the Senate and 55 seats in the House, close to the actual outcome of a pickup of 6 seats in the Senate and 63 seats in the House.[538 44]\n\nWriters [ edit ]\n\nWhen the transition to The New York Times was announced, Silver listed his staff of writers for the first time.[40] However, of the seven listed writers, only three of them had published on 538/New York Times by late December 2010: Silver, Renard Sexton and Hale Stewart. Andrew Gelman contributed again in early 2011.[538 45] Brian McCabe published his first article in January 2011.[538 46][c]\n\nBeginning in 2011, one writer who emerged as a regular contributor was Micah Cohen. Cohen provided a periodic \"Reads and Reactions\" column in which he summarized Silver's articles for the previous couple of weeks, as well as reactions to them in the media and other blogs, and suggested some additional readings related to the subject of Silver's columns. Silver identified Cohen as \"my news assistant\".[538 47] Cohen also contributed additional columns on occasion.[538 48]\n\nOn September 12, 2011, Silver introduced another writer: \"FiveThirtyEight extends a hearty welcome to John Sides, a political scientist at George Washington University, who will be writing a series of posts for this site over the next month. Mr. Sides is also the founder of the blog The Monkey Cage, which was named the 2010 Blog of the Year by The Week magazine\".[538 49]\n\nBeyond electoral politics [ edit ]\n\nWhile politics and elections remained the main focus of FiveThirtyEight, the blog also sometimes addressed sports, including the March Madness[538 50][538 51][42] and the 2012 NCAA Men's Basketball tournament selection process,[538 52] the B.C.S. rankings in NCAA college football,[43] the NBA,[538 53][538 54][538 55] and Major League Baseball matters ranging from the 2011 attendance at the New York Mets' Citi Field[538 56] to the historic 2011 collapse of the Boston Red Sox.[538 57] The site has also posted forecasts for the Academy Awards.[44]\n\nIn addition, FiveThirtyEight sometimes turned its attention to other topics, such as the economics of blogging,[538 58] the financial ratings by Standard & Poors,[538 59] economists' tendency to underpredict unemployment levels,[538 60] and the economic impact and media coverage of Hurricane Irene (2011).[538 61][538 62]\n\nAdapted from a FiveThirtyEight October 2011 graph published in The New York Times [ 538 63 ]\n\nFiveThirtyEight published a graph showing different growth curves of the news stories covering Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street protests. Silver pointed out that conflicts with the police caused the sharpest increases in news coverage of the protests[538 63] and assessed the geography of the protests by analyzing news reports of the size and location of events across the United States.[538 64]\n\n2012 U.S. elections [ edit ]\n\nFiveThirtyEight rolled out its 2012 general election forecasting model on June 7, 2012. The model forecast both the popular vote and the Electoral College vote, with the latter being central to the exercise and involving a forecast of each state. In the initial forecast, Barack Obama was estimated to have a 61.8% chance of winning the electoral vote. The website provided maps and statistics about the electoral outcomes in each state as well as nationally. Later posts addressed methodological issues such as the \"house effects\" of different pollsters as well as the validity of telephone surveys that did not call cell phones.[538 65]\n\nOn the morning of November 6, Election Day, Silver's model gave President Obama a 90.9% chance of winning a majority of the electoral votes.[538 66] The 538 model correctly predicted the winner of all 50 states and the District of Columbia.[45][d] Silver, along with at least two academic-based analysts who aggregated polls from multiple pollsters, thus not only correctly predicted all 50 states, but also all nine \"swing states\".[46] In contrast, individual pollsters were less successful. For example, Rasmussen Reports \"missed on six of its nine swing-state polls\".[47]\n\nAn independent analysis of Silver's state-by-state projections, assessing whether the percentages of votes that the candidates actually received fell within the \"margin of error\" of Silver's forecasts, found that \"48 out of 50 states actually fell within his margin of error, giving him a success rate of 96%. And assuming that his projected margin of error figures represent 95 percent confidence intervals, which it is likely they did, Silver performed just about exactly as well as he would expect to over 50 trials. Wizard, indeed\".[48][49] Additional tests of the accuracy of the electoral vote predictions were published by other researchers.[50][51]\n\nESPN and ABC News affiliation [ edit ]\n\nIn July 2013, it was revealed that Silver and his FiveThirtyEight blog would depart The New York Times and join ESPN.[52] In its announcement of its acquisition of FiveThirtyEight, ESPN reported that \"Silver will serve as the editor-in-chief of the site and will build a team of journalists, editors, analysts and contributors in the coming months. Much like Grantland, which ESPN launched in 2011, the site will retain an independent brand sensibility and editorial point-of-view, while interfacing with other websites in the ESPN and Disney families. The site will return to its original URL, www.FiveThirtyEight.com.\"[53]\n\nAccording to Silver, the focus of FiveThirtyEight in its ESPN phase would broaden: \"People also think it's going to be a sports site with a little politics thrown in, or it's going to be a politics site with sports thrown in. ... But we take our science and economics and lifestyle coverage very seriously. ... It's a data journalism site. Politics is one topic that sometimes data journalism is good at covering. It's certainly good with presidential elections. But we don't really see politics as how the site is going to grow\".[54]\n\nFiveThirtyEight launched its ESPN webpage on March 17, 2014. The lead story by Silver explained that \"FiveThirtyEight is a data journalism organization. ... We've expanded our staff from two full-time journalists to 20 and counting. Few of them will focus on politics exclusively; instead, our coverage will span five major subject areas \u2013 politics, economics, science, life and sports. Our team also has a broad set of skills and experience in methods that fall under the rubric of data journalism. These include statistical analysis, but also data visualization, computer programming and data-literate reporting. So in addition to written stories, we'll have interactive graphics and features\".[538 67] FiveThirtyEight launched its ESPN-affiliated stage on March 17, 2014. As of July, it had a staff of 20 writers, editors, data visualization specialists, and others.[538 68] By March 2016, this staff had nearly doubled to 37 listed on the masthead, and 7 listed as contributors.[55] The site produced articles under 5 headings: politics, economics, science and health, (cultural) life, and sports. In addition to feature articles it produced podcasts on a range of subjects.\n\nMonthly traffic to the site grew steadily from about 2.8 million unique visitors in April 2014 to 10.7 million unique visitors in January 2016.[56]\n\n2014 U.S. elections [ edit ]\n\nOn September 3, 2014, FiveThirtyEight introduced its forecasts for each of the 36 U.S. Senate elections being contested that year.[538 69] At that time, the Republican Party was given a 64 percent chance of holding a majority of the seats in the Senate after the election. However, Silver also remarked, \"An equally important theme is the high degree of uncertainty around that outcome. A large number of states remain competitive, and Democrats could easily retain the Senate\".[538 70] About two weeks later, the forecast showed the Republican chances of holding the majority down to 55 percent.[538 71]\n\n2016 Oscars predictions [ edit ]\n\nFiveThirtyEight sought to apply its mathematical models to the Oscars, and produced internal predictions regarding the subject, predicting four out of six categories correctly.[57] The website also compiled a list of other predictions made by other people using different methods.[58]\n\n2016 U.S. elections [ edit ]\n\nPresidential primary elections [ edit ]\n\nFiveThirtyEight applied two separate models to forecast the 2016 presidential primary elections \u2013 polls-only and polls-plus models. The polls-only model relied only on polls from a particular state, while the polls-plus model was based on state polls, national polls and endorsements. For each contest, FiveThirtyEight produced probability distributions and average expected vote shares according to both models.[59]\n\nAs early as June 2015, FiveThirtyEight argued that Donald Trump \"isn't a real candidate\".[60] When Donald Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee in May 2016, New York Times media columnist Jim Rutenberg wrote that \"predictions can have consequences\" and criticized FiveThirtyEight for underestimating Trump's chances. He argued that by giving \"Mr. Trump a 2 percent chance at the nomination despite strong polls in his favor ... they also arguably sapped the journalistic will to scour his record as aggressively as those of his supposedly more serious rivals\".[61]\n\nIn a long retrospective, \"How I Acted Like a Pundit and Screwed up on Donald Trump\", published in May 2016 after Trump had become the likely nominee, Silver reviewed how he had erred in evaluating Trump's chances early in the primary campaign. Silver wrote, \"The big mistake is a curious one for a website that focuses on statistics. Unlike virtually every other forecast we publish at FiveThirtyEight \u2013 including the primary and caucus projections I just mentioned \u2013 our early estimates of Trump's chances weren't based on a statistical model. Instead, they were what we [call] 'subjective odds' \u2013 which is to say, educated guesses. In other words, we were basically acting like pundits, but attaching numbers to our estimates. And we succumbed to some of the same biases that pundits often suffer, such as not changing our minds quickly enough in the face of new evidence. Without a model as a fortification, we found ourselves rambling around the countryside like all the other pundit-barbarians, randomly setting fire to things\".[62]\n\nOn the Democratic side, FiveThirtyEight argued that Senator Bernie Sanders could \"lose everywhere else after Iowa and New Hampshire\"[63] and that the \"Democratic establishment would rush in to squash\" him if he does not.[64] Sanders went on to win 23 states in the primaries.\n\nFairness and Accuracy in Reporting, a progressive nonprofit media watch group, wrote in May 2016 that FiveThirtyEight \"sacrificed its integrity to go after Sanders\" and that they have \"at times gone beyond the realm of punditry into the realm of hackery \u2013 that is, not just treating their own opinions as though they were objective data, but spinning the data so that it conforms to their opinions.\"[65]\n\nFiveThirtyEight's predictions for each state primary, both for the Republican and the Democratic party nominations, were based on statistical analysis, not on the analyst's opinions. The core data employed were polls, which FiveThirtyEight aggregated for each state (while also considering national polls) using essentially the same method it had employed since 2008. In the 2016 primaries, the projections also took into account endorsements.[66] The website also kept track of the accumulation of national party convention delegates.[67] In a comparison of prediction success published by Bloomberg News after the primary season was completed, FiveThirtyEight's prediction success tied for the highest percentage of correct primary poll winners, at 92%; but it lagged behind PredictWise in predicting a larger set of primaries.[68] Notably, even with FiveThirtyEight's track record of correctly predicting elections that pollsters get wrong, it still missed Bernie Sanders's upset victory in the Michigan primary, for instance, regarded as \"one of the biggest upsets in modern political history\".[65]\n\nPresidential general election [ edit ]\n\nThe final prediction by FiveThirtyEight on the morning of election day (November 8, 2016) had Hillary Clinton with a 71% chance to win the 2016 United States presidential election,[69] while other major forecasters had predicted Clinton to win with at least an 85% to 99% probability.[70][71] FiveThirtyEight's model pointed to the possibility of an Electoral College-popular vote split widening in final weeks based on both Clinton's small lead in general polls, but also on Trump's improvement in swing states like Florida or Pennsylvania, mixed with Clinton's poor performance in several of those swing states in comparison with Obama's performance in 2012.[72] The main issues pointed out by the forecast model was the imbalance of Clinton's improvement in very populated states like Texas, Georgia (projected safe for Republican) and California (projected safe for Democrats);[72] mixed with her inability to attract white voters without a college degree, an increasing demographic in swing states, in addition to a potential decline in turnout from minorities.[73] In consequence, Clinton's probabilities to win the Electoral College were not improving.[72] Silver also focused on state-by-state numbers in so-called 'must-win' states like Ohio and Florida, plus a consideration of polls' margin of error in advantages of less than three points.[74]\n\nDonald Trump won the election. FiveThirtyEight projected a much higher probability of Donald Trump winning the presidency than other pollsters,[70] a projection which was criticized by Ryan Grim of the Huffington Post as \"unskewing\" too much in favor of Trump.[75] While FiveThirtyEight expressed that \"nonetheless, Clinton is probably going to win, and she could win by a big margin\", the forecaster also made points about the uncertainty of poll trackers in some cases, the considerable number of undecided voters, and the unpredictable outcome in traditional swing states.[76]\n\nIn April 2018, it was announced that FiveThirtyEight would be transferred to ABC News from ESPN, Inc., majority owned by The Walt Disney Company.[77] ABC News Live streaming channel was launched on Roku in May 2019.[78] With the reorganization creating the Walt Disney Direct-to-Consumer and International segment in March 2018, ABC News Digital and Live Streaming (websites, ABC News Live and FiveThirtyEight) was transferred to the new segment.[79]\n\n2020 U.S. elections [ edit ]\n\nRedesign of forecast [ edit ]\n\nIn early August 2020, FiveThirtyEight announced that for their 2020 general election forecast they had designed a new graphical structure. This included going with modular structure, a \"ball swarm\" design for the chart depicting each candidate's chances, and the addition of a \"forecast mascot\" named Fivey Fox.[538 72] An episode of \"Chart Chat\" discussing the design described the direction saying \"FiveThirtyEight has leaned heavily towards a cutesy and engaging approach. The Fivey Fox mascot pops up next to most charts with call-outs to more further information.\"[80]\n\nFivey Fox would also issue reminders to readers of \"the potential for extreme outcomes\" according to Jessica Hullman, in a piece written for The Hill. Hullman also said of the design that the introduction of the mascot, in conjunction with the new simplified look of the page, was \"perhaps the strongest indicator that Silver intends to emphasize uncertainty\" in his coverage of the 2020 election.[81]\n\nJasmine Mithani, visual journalist with FiveThirtyEight, said in an interview when asked about the complaints of new mascot said \"I think the biggest complaint about Fivey Fox is that some people find it infantilizing, but that wasn't our intention\" and that the motivation for including the character was to help make the forecast more of \"a teaching tool\".[82] In November 2020, Rolling Stone reported that Fivey Fox had reached over 7,000 followers on his dedicated Twitter account.[83]\n\nThe forecast favored the actual winner of 48 states, the District of Columbia, and four of the five congressional districts awarding electoral votes, only missing Florida, North Carolina, and Maine's 2nd congressional district. In those three contests the forecast had favored Biden, but they were carried by Trump. Despite correctly forecasting Biden to win nationally, they overestimated Biden's margins in some battleground states such as Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania and underestimated Trump's margins in states such as Ohio, Iowa and Texas. Their forecast showed Democrats winning Senate races in North Carolina and Maine, which Republicans ended up winning. However, their forecast did correctly predict that the Democrats would take control of the Senate. In the House elections, their forecast favored Democrats to gain seats, yet Democrats suffered a net loss of 10 seats. The actual house results fell outside their 80% confidence interval, with Democrats winning 222 seats, lower than the confidence interval's lower bound of 225.[84]\n\n2023 cost-cutting and 2024 elections [ edit ]\n\nIn January 2023, The Daily Beast reported that the website was on the \"chopping block\" amid cost-cutting measures by ABC News, and a sale of the website was being considered. It also noted that several key employees including managing editor Micah Cohen, politics editor Sarah E. Frostenson and sports editor Sara Ziegler had left the website and their positions had not been filled.[85] An ABC spokesperson responded to the report, asserting \"no imminent decisions about [its] relationship with FiveThirtyEight.\"[86] Nonetheless, in April, Silver announced that he would be leaving the site amid widespread layoffs at ABC News, who said the website would be \"streamlined\" ahead of the 2024 election cycle; editor Chadwick Matlin was among the many laid off.[87] According to Silver, two thirds of FiveThirtyEight's staff were cut in one day.[88] Since the layoffs, FiveThirtyEight's sports and science coverage has ground to a halt, with the website mostly returning to its roots of exclusive politics coverage.[89][90]\n\nIn May 2023, ABC News hired G. Elliott Morris, a data journalist for The Economist who has often been described as a rival of Silver,[91] to head the site as editorial director of data analytics.[92] At 538, Morris developed a new election forecasting model of the 2024 election. In the leadup to Biden's withdrawal, 538 was the only professional election forecaster to give Biden majority odds of winning the 2024 election.[93] Silver criticized Morris's model, describing it as at best ignoring the polls and giving Biden positive odds merely due to his incumbency, and at worst as being \"buggy\".[93][94] The election forecast remained suspended for a month after Biden withdrew, before being replaced by a new model for Kamala Harris versus Trump that put more emphasis on polling.[95]\n\nRecognition and awards [ edit ]\n\nMascot [ edit ]\n\nFivey Fox is the mascot of FiveThirtyEight.[538 72] This is in reference to a phrase attributed to Archilochus: \"The fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing\".[538 67] The name \"Fivey\" is a reference to the website's name, FiveThirtyEight. Fivey Fox is colored orange, white, and beige with comically sized black glasses and has white colored sock-like paws.\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nNotes [ edit ]\n\n^ Several national firms use the name \"Strategic Vision\"; only one has been releasing political polling results to the media. ^ FiveThirtyEight when he made some provocative discoveries of anomalies in the reported results of the 2009 Election in Iran.
